The fix came amid mounting selling pressure against the yuan, as sentiment towards China soured.\n\nThe offshore yuan was much weaker, with the USDCNH pair rising past 7.28, also hitting a seven-month high.\n\nWhile the PBOC has so far attempted to maintain some stability in the yuan against recent selling pressure, the currency's latest bout of weakness suggest that the central bank may have no choice but to let the yuan depreciate in the near-term.\n\nThe PBOC has so far kept a tight hold on the yuan through the midpoint fix and market operations. It had reportedly intervened in currency markets earlier this year to brace the yuan against a bout of selling pressure.\n\nBut sentiment towards China soured substantially in recent weeks, especially as Beijing flagged the possibility of a trade war over import tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles by the U.S. and the European Union.\n\nEuropean tariffs were a key point of contention for China, given that the region is a major market for local EV makers. Chinese automakers were also seen calling for retaliatory tariffs on European vehicle imports.\n\nChinese and German ministers met this week to discuss the tariffs, which are set to be imposed in July.\n\nAdding to concerns over a trade war, Canada was also seen potentially joining the U.S. and EU in imposing curbs on Chinese EVs, which are seen as providing stiff competition to local automakers.\n\n?

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Ke (BEKE) is trading 1.94 percent higher on Thursday 7th of November and has a trading volume of USD 91.4 mnNov 06, 2024\n\nKe (BEKE) traded up 1.94 % during a 24 hours period ending at 03:39 AM Central Europe on Thursday 7th. One Ke stock can currently be bought for about USD 59.75 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Ke stocks is 1.2 bn. Ke has a current market capitalization of USD 26.8 bn and approximately USD 91.4 mn worth of Ke was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Ke has traded -6.96 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at USD 15.77. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at USD 26.04 on 10/04/2024. 52 weeks low was at USD 12.44 on 03/08/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Ke\n\nTitle: KE Holdings Inc. Stock Soars on Analyst Upgrade; Is the Upswing Sustainable? In a recent development, KE Holdings Inc. (KE) has been upgraded to \"Buy\" by Bank of America (BofA), with analysts citing the company's position as a beneficiary of China's stimulus package. This move has sent the stock soaring, with shares currently trading at $22.09, just shy of their 52-week high of $26.045. From a technical standpoint, KE's recent upswing appears to be gaining momentum. The stock has broken above its previous resistance level of $21.50, indicating that buyers are becoming more aggressive in their bids. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently sitting at 64.26, which suggests that the stock may still have room to run before reaching overbought territory. However, it's worth noting that KE's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 43.51 is significantly higher than the industry average of 24.64. This could indicate that investors are anticipating strong future growth, but it also means that the stock may be more sensitive to any disappointment in earnings. Furthermore, the stock's price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 2.69502 is lower than the industry average of 3.47, suggesting that investors may be undervaluing the company's assets. Conclusion: While the upgrade from BofA certainly provides a boost to KE's prospects, investors should exercise caution when considering an investment in the company. While the stock's technical indicators suggest that it may continue to rise in the short term, the high P/E ratio and relatively low P/B ratio warrant careful evaluation before making a decision. As always, it's important to conduct thorough research and consider multiple perspectives before making an investment.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Anta Sports Products (2020.HK) traded up 3.91 % and now trades at HKD 88.5. Anta Sports Products has a market capitalisation of HKD 238.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Anta Sports Products is 17. In recent trading days, the stock price of Anta Sports Products has experienced significant volatility. On October 30th, the stock fell by 4.04% to close at 10,03 euros per share, marking a decline from its previous closing price. This drop follows a positive trend seen earlier in the week, when the stock reached a high of 10,532 euros on October 28th, representing a gain of 3.32%. Despite this fluctuation, investors remain optimistic about the company's performance and continue to buy shares. The current market capitalization of Anta Sports Products stands at approximately 10 billion euros.\n\n- Sf (002352.SZ) traded up 0.26 % and now trades at CNY 44.4. Sf has a market capitalisation of CNY 220.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Sf is 23.13. SF Holding Co Ltd Eyes Second Listing in Hong Kong; Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals In an effort to expand its reach and raise capital, Chinese courier giant SF Express has set its sights on a second listing in Hong Kong, with plans to go public on November 27th, according to a report by Bloomberg. This move comes as the company seeks to tap into the city's deep pool of investors and take advantage of its status as a global financial hub. From a technical standpoint, the stock has exhibited mixed signals over the past year, with fluctuations in both the price and volume. The last closing price of 44.21 CNY represents a decrease of -5.1% compared to the 52-week high of 49.38 CNY reached on October 7th, 2024. However, this decline has been partially offset by a gain of +14.6% since the 52-week low of 32.93 CNY hit on February 4th, 2024. Looking at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, SF Holding Co Ltd currently trades at a premium, with a multiple of 21.66 times earnings. This is slightly above the industry average, indicating that investors have priced in expectations of strong future growth. Meanwhile, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio stands at 2.3548, suggesting that the market values the company's assets at a discount relative to its peers. Despite these positive indicators, some analysts remain cautious due to concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the logistics sector. However, with vaccination rates increasing globally and economies gradually reopening, there may be opportunities for companies like SF Express to benefit from the recovery. In conclusion, while the near-term outlook for SF Holding Co Ltd remains uncertain, the company's expansion plans and solid fundamentals suggest that it could be a compelling long-term investment opportunity for risk-tolerant investors. As always, it is important to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Seres (601127.SS) traded up 10 % and now trades at CNY 132. Seres has a market capitalisation of CNY 207.6 bn. Seres has a current price to earnings ratio of 53.64. Title: SERES Group Co Ltd: Technical Analysis Reveals Upswing Potential Investors may be eyeing SERES Group Co Ltd (SEHK:2408) with renewed interest, given the company's recent expansion into European markets and strong historical performance. As of September 11th, 2024, the stock closed at 75.91 CNH, just shy of its 52-week high of 106.66 CNH reached on March 17th, 2024. This marks a significant recovery from the 52-week low of 41.6 CNH seen on September 13th, 2023. A closer look at the company's financial ratios paints an even more promising picture. With a Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 224.26, investors can expect substantial growth potential compared to industry peers. Additionally, the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) stands at 8.76, indicating undervaluation based on the company's net assets. These figures suggest that SERES may be poised for long-term success and potentially offer attractive entry points for savvy investors. While there have been no recent news updates on the company, the successful launch of their new energy vehicle product, SERES 5, in Europe bodes well for future sales and revenue growth. Furthermore, the first batch of user deliveries took place on June 21st, 2023, in Norway, highlighting the company's commitment to expanding its global presence. Given these positive developments and the company's solid financials, it may be worth considering SERES Group Co Ltd as a viable investment opportunity. However, as with any investment decision, it is essential to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any moves.\n\n- Nari (600406.SS) traded up 1.35 % and now trades at CNY 27.19. Nari has a market capitalisation of CNY 213.5 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Nari is 28.49.\n\n- Ping An Bank (000001.SZ) traded up 1.66 % and now trades at CNY 11.64. Current market capitalisation for Ping An Bank is CNY 225.9 bn. Ping An Bank has a current price to earnings ratio of 5.17. Title: Technical Analysis: Ping An Bank's Price Plunge Raises Eyebrows In a surprising move, the share price of Ping An Bank Co Ltd (HKG:2318) has plummeted over the past few months, raising concerns among investors. As of November 6th, 2024, the stock closed at 11.65 CNY, marking a significant drop from its 52-week high of 13.43 CNY recorded on October 7th, 2024. This downward trend has prompted analysts to reassess the company's financial health and outlook. A quick glance at the price chart reveals that the stock has been experiencing a steady decline since peaking in mid-October. This downtrend has been accompanied by a decrease in trading volume, which could indicate a lack of interest from buyers. However, it's worth noting that the stock still maintains a respectable liquidity level, with an average daily trading volume of approximately 2.5 million shares. One possible reason behind Ping An Bank's price drop could be the recent lowering of interest rates for deposits, as reported by aastocks.com on July 26th, 2024. This move may have dampened investor enthusiasm, as it could potentially reduce the bank's profitability. Nevertheless, the decision to lower interest rates could also be seen as a proactive measure to support the economy during these challenging times. From a valuation standpoint, Ping An Bank's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 5.17, representing a discount compared to its historical averages. Additionally, the stock's price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 0.471418 suggests that it is undervalued based on its assets. These metrics might appeal to value investors seeking bargains in the financial sector. However, it's important to note that the company's financial performance has been mixed recently. While net profits for the first half of 2024 increased by 12% year-over-year, the second quarter saw a slight dip in earnings due to higher provisions for loan losses. Moreover, the bank's return on equity (ROE) has been steadily decreasing since the beginning of the year, which could be a cause for concern among investors. Taking everything into account, the current situation with Ping An Bank presents a complex picture. On one hand, the stock's attractive valuations and solid financials could make it an appealing choice for value investors. On the other hand, the recent price drop and mixed financial performance might warrant caution before jumping into the stock. As such, investors should carefully weigh the pros and cons before making any investment decisions regarding Ping An Bank.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Ke\n\nKE Holdings Inc. is an integrated online and offline platform for housing transactions and services operating in China.

This comes after the company's previous high of 13.18 CNH on December 11th, 2023, and a 52-week low of 8.33 CNH on August 27th, 2024. Technical Analysis From a technical standpoint, Kingnet Network's stock has been trending upwards since mid-December 2023, with a brief pullback in early January 2024. The stock has been consolidating between 9.47 CNH and 10.67 CNH over the past month, indicating a strong support level at 9.47 CNH.

Outlook Despite the lack of recent news, Kingnet Network's share price has remained resilient due to its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. Investors may view the stock as a solid long-term investment opportunity, given its undervalued status and potential for future growth. However, any significant changes in the company's financial performance or industry landscape could impact the stock's trajectory moving forward.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Levima Advanced Materials\n\nLevima Advanced Materials Corporation is a research-oriented company that specializes in the development, production, and distribution of advanced materials.

If the market can break above the 7.15 level, then it's likely that the US dollar goes looking to the 7.31 region. Underneath, if we were to break down below the 7.09 level, then I think you would start to see the US dollar fall pretty precipitously against most currencies. After all, the greenback is considered a safety currency and is traded as such. I believe that traders will continue to look to the USD if they are concerned about the global economy.\n\n[geotargetedbrokercarousel]\n\n * The US dollar has done very little during the trading session against the Chinese yuan, as we are hanging around the 7.11 level.\n * This is an area that has been important multiple times in the past and is an area of support right around the weekly chart on the 1.10 price fulcrum.\n * At this point, I think we are starting to ask questions about whether or not the global economy could come into play and perhaps in the US dollar higher.\n * Again, remember the Chinese Yuan is considered to be a risk asset due to the fact that so many goods come out of China for the rest of the world. It's also not necessarily a free floating currency.\n\nRisk is a 1 to 1 correlation\n\nEven if it's just the Chinese Yuan we are looking at, you have to recognize that has a lot to do with risk appetite overall. This is a market that tends to be very noisy and that's not a huge surprise. Ultimately, we have to look at this through the prism of how global trade is going. Recently, we've seen pretty poor numbers coming out of China and that may lend for more of a risk off or a bounce in this pair.

SWIFT is a global provider of financial messaging services. \n\n China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is the largest market for offshore yuan transactions, taking up 76.18 percent, followed by the UK at 6.16 percent and Singapore at 3.76 percent, the report said. \n\n The data shows that the yuan is becoming increasingly popular as more countries are willing to use the Chinese currency in cross-border trade settlement, conduct cross-border investment and financing, and sign currency swap deals with China, Xi Junyang, a professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Thursday. \n\n With solid efforts to promote yuan's internationalization in recent years, China has seen a strengthened role of the yuan across the board, from international payment and settlement, investment and financing, and reserves to pricing. \n\n As of the end of August, the People's Bank of China (PBC), the country's central bank, signed bilateral currency swap agreements with 42 foreign central banks or monetary authorities. A total of 29 bilateral currency swap agreements are in force, with a total scale of about 4.1 trillion yuan ($561.72 billion), the Xinhua News Agency reported, citing a PBC report. \n\n The PBC stressed at a meeting on Monday that the central bank will steadily boost financial reform and high-level opening-up next. It said efforts will be made to promote the internationalization of the yuan in a careful and robust manner, further enhance its functions as an international currency for cross-border payments, investment and financing, reserves and other functions. Meanwhile, the central bank will strengthen the competitiveness of the yuan cross-border payment system. \n\n The internationalization of the yuan is an important part of China's financial opening-up. Looking ahead, efforts are needed in several aspects to boost the yuan's internationalization, Xi said. He said the country should continue to expand opening-up, strengthen connect programs with other markets, and facilitate convenience in cross-border investment and fund-raising. \n\n As an increasingly international currency, the yuan is able to maintain a stable exchange rate in the future thanks to multiple favorable factors, including the central government's supportive macroeconomic policies that have improved market expectations, sustained economic recovery and foreign exchange market resilience. \n\n\nCopyright Global Times.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Offshore Yuan Holds Firm at Over 1-Year HighThe offshore yuan strengthened past 7.04 per dollar, remaining at its highest level since May 2023 and marking its third consecutive session of gains. This surge followed the PBoC's decision to maintain key lending rates during the September fixing, in line with market expectations. The one-year loan prime rate (LPR), the benchmark for most corporate and household loans, remained unchanged at 3.35%, while the five-year rate, a reference for property mortgages, held steady at 3.85%. Both rates are still at record lows following unexpected cuts in July. Externally, the yuan’s appreciation is also supported by a pressured US dollar, as the Fed's substantial rate cut has increased the chances of a potential soft landing for the US economy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

Activity in SGX Group's marketplaces increased across asset classes as global investors managed portfolio risks in response to manifold economic and political developments during a volatile month. Derivatives traded volume gained 15% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 23.5 million contracts.\n\nTowards the end of July, SGX Group's Japan-access derivatives suite enabled market participants to manage risk around Japan's monetary policy decisions. As the Bank of Japan (BOJ) raised its benchmark interest rate and announced plans to slow its monthly bond purchases, the volume of SGX three-month Tokyo Overnight Average (TONA) Futures topped 532 lots following the contract's debut on 29 July, while month-end open interest (OI) in SGX Mini Japanese Government Bond (JGB) Futures rose 21% month-on-month (m-o-m). In addition, the pioneering SGX Nikkei 225 Index Futures saw 52,504 lots (US$6.8 billion notional) traded on 31 July – up 36% over the daily average for the month.\n\nKey highlights:\n\n* Record FX futures volume: total futures traded volume on SGX FX climbed 44% y-o-y in July to 4.8 million contracts, an all-time high. Gains were led by SGX USD/CNH FX Futures – the world's most widely traded international renminbi futures – with volume up 40% y-o-y at a record 2.9 million contracts, while SGX INR/USD FX Futures volume increased 48% y-o-y to 1.6 million contracts. Anticipation of rate decisions by the BOJ and the Federal Reserve, as well as uncertainties over the U.S. presidential elections, fuelled volatility and bolstered portfolio hedging.\n\n* New interest-rate hedging tools with focus on central banks: SGX Fixed Income launched three-month TONA and Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA) Futures on 29 July, as investors seek more accessible and cost-effective tools to hedge and trade fluctuations in interest rates. The contracts build upon SGX's offering of long-term interest rate futures comprising 10-year Full-Sized and Mini JGB futures.\n\n* Broad-based commodities gains, with record dairy OI: Commodity derivatives traded volume rose 20% y-o-y in July to 5.1 million contracts, with bellwether iron ore derivatives volume up 22% y-o-y on elevated risk management amid diverse views on China's growth outlook. Over the first seven months of 2024, 13.3 million metric tonnes (MT) of petrochemicals derivatives have traded on SGX Commodities, close to the 13.4 million MT cleared in all of 2023. Dairy derivatives OI set a single-day record of 171,335 lots on 16 July, rounding off the month with a record average of 106,386 lots.\n\n* Highest SIMSCI OI notional value in more than four years: OI in SGX MSCI Singapore Index Futures rose 42% y-o-y in July to 221,551 lots, with notional value surpassing US$5 billion for the first time since January 2020 amid strong buyside interest in safe-haven markets. SGX FTSE Taiwan Index Futures volume gained 15% y-o-y, as overnight volumes climbed to a peak of 53,029 lots (US$4.1 billion notional) on 18 July following the release of chipmaker TSMC's earnings. On SGX Equity Derivatives, total equity index futures volume increased 5% y-o-y to 13.1 million contracts.\n\n* SDAV growth leads region: Securities daily average value (SDAV) rose 13% y-o-y and 4% m-o-m in July to S$1.2 billion against declines across Southeast Asia, with higher retail activity across stock segments. The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) advanced 3.7% m-o-m to 3,455.94, also outpacing peers across ASEAN and Developed Asia, with year-to-date returns of 6.7%. During the month, Singapore's stock market remained the second most-actively traded in Southeast Asia. Total securities market turnover value increased 23% y-o-y and 26% m-o-m to S$26.5 billion.\n\n* Record REIT ETF turnover: The market turnover value of exchange-traded funds (ETF) jumped 48% m-o-m in July to S$404 million. For real-estate investment trust (REIT) ETFs, active participation from retail and robo-advisors lifted trading to a record S$131 million. Turnover of daily leverage certificates (DLC) surged 36% m-o-m to S$219 million, with Singapore-underlying DLCs showing the most increases.\n\n* Mainboard listing: SGX Securities welcomed the secondary listing of Helens International Holdings Company Limited on Mainboard on 19 July. The company runs one of the largest bar chain networks in the PRC.\n\nSource: Singapore Exchange\n\n[Category: Technology Hardware, Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals, New Offerings]\n\nCopyright 2017 Contify.com"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

The currency was trading near its strongest\nlevel since early January.\n    The dollar <=USD> dropped 0.5% against major currencies to\ntrade at 102.62 - a near five-month low.  \n    \"Fears of a U.S. recession mean that the market is no longer\nlooking for an orderly adjustment in Fed policy towards some\nkind of neutral rate - say near 3.25%. No, the fear of a\nrecession is now bringing in the idea of stimulative monetary\npolicy,\" noted Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING.\n    \"It is no surprise to see low-yielding currencies now in the\nascendancy as the rest of the world now starts to converge on\ntheir low interest rates.\"\n        The yen has jumped 14% against the dollar over the past\nthree weeks, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's 15-basis\npoints rate rise last week to 0.25%, alongside which it\nannounced a plan to halve its monthly bond purchases over the\nnext couple of years.\n    Barclays analysts said the Japanese currency was the most\noverbought among G10 majors, and therefore \"the bar for yet more\noutperformance in the near term appears high\".\n    The Swiss franc <CHF=EBS>, another popular funding currency,\nwas up more than 1% at 0.84825 to the dollar. The franc, a\ntraditional safe haven, was also trading at a seven-month high. \n    High-yielding currencies such as the Indian rupee <INR=IN>\nand Mexican peso <MXN=> tumbled, while currencies that had\nhitherto been used for funding investments, such as the yen and\nChina's yuan  <CNH=>, rallied strongly.     \n    Treasury yields have been falling quite sharply since last\nweek, when the Federal Reserve kept the policy rate in its\ncurrent 5.25% to 5.50% range while Chair Jerome Powell opened\nthe possibility of a rate cut in September.\n    But by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate had\njumped, which sparked chatter the U.S. economy could be heading\nfor a recession, expectations for rate cuts deepened.\n    Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries <US10YT=RR> sank nearly 40\nbasis points last week, the largest weekly fall since March\n2020, and were last at 3.75%.\n    Fed fund futures reflected traders pricing a near 99% chance\nof a 50 basis point cut at the central bank's September meeting,\naccording to LSEG data. Futures imply 127 basis points of cuts\nthis year.\n        The euro was up 0.2% at $1.0954 <EUR=EBS> despite the\nexpectation for interest rate cuts from the European Central\nBank (ECB) surging. Traders now see more than 90 basis points of\nrate cut from the ECB this year, versus 50 bps at the start of\nlast week.  \n    Meanwhile, markets are also dealing with the risk of\nmilitary escalation in the Middle East after latest developments\nin the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which has driven\noil prices <CLc1> to their lowest since January. \n    The U.S. military is deploying more forces in the Middle\nEast and Europe following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas\nand Hezbollah to respond to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail\nHaniyeh last week in Tehran.\n     \n    \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates    https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\nFX moves 10 days    https://tmsnrt.rs/4dpFKRs\nGraphic-US unemployment rate     https://tmsnrt.rs/3piciFu\nGraphic-US inflation and interest rates    https://reut.rs/4fvmDas\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore and Sruthi Shankar\nin Bengaluru; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Ros Russell)\n ((Vidya.ranganathan@tr.com))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

The central\nbank's daily benchmark fixings and support from state-owned\nbanks have slowed its decline but it hit a five-month low of\n7.2422 on April 16.\n    The currency is down 1.9% this year, pressured by its\nrelative low yield versus other currencies and outflows of\nforeign investment from an anaemic stock market.   \n    Prior to market open, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set\nthe midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed\nto trade in a 2% band, at 7.102 per U.S. dollar, firmer than the\nprevious fix 7.1025. \n    The fixing is 1,261 pips firmer than a Reuters estimate but\nthe deviation has shrunk from the strong guidance in the past\nweeks.\n    \"Raising the (dollar-onshore yuan) fix could have the\npropensity to drive the (dollar-offshore yuan) higher and what\nPBoC likely desires is a controlled pace of yuan depreciation in\nthe face of a strong (U.S. dollar) environment,\" Maybank\nanalysts said in a note.\n    In the spot market, the yuan <CNY=CFXS> opened at 7.2347 per\ndollar and was changing hands at 7.2359 at midday, 24 pips\nfirmer from the previous late session close.\n    The PBOC said it will maintain the yuan stability, it wrote\nin state newspaper People's Daily on Thursday.\n    \"We must insist that the yuan exchange rate is mainly\ndetermined by the market, and at the same time resolutely\ncorrect pro-cyclical behaviour and prevent the risk of exchange\nrate overshooting.\"\n    The dollar was soft on Thursday as traders assessed the U.S.\ninterest rates outlook following comments from Federal Reserve\nofficials that cemented expectations of monetary settings\nremaining restrictive for a while longer.\n    The greenback has been rising in recent weeks amid strong\nU.S. economic data, persistent inflation and conflict between\nIsrael and Iran in the Middle East, casting a shadow across\ncurrency markets including the yuan.\n    \"We are of the view that (dollar-onshore yuan) central\nparity is likely to remain stable as PBoC continues to keep a\ngrip on the RMB,\" Maybank said.\n    The global dollar index <=USD> fell to 105.866 from the\nprevious close of 105.951.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "AUD/USD Stabilizes Amid Chinese Economic Data And US Inflation ConcernsBy RoboForex Analytical Department\n\nThe Australian dollar has momentarily halted its downward trajectory against the US dollar, stabilizing around the 0.6565 mark. With a lack of significant domestic data from Australia, the AUD's movements are largely influenced by the performance of the Chinese yuan and economic developments from China. Recently, the offshore yuan weakened to its lowest in a week at 7.2 against the US dollar, following a series of macroeconomic updates from China.\n\nChina's industrial output showed an impressive year-on-year increase of 7.0%, exceeding both the anticipated 6.5% growth and the previous rate of 4.6%. Capital investment also outperformed expectations, registering a 4.2% year-on-year rise compared to the forecasted 3.2%. Retail sales growth in February was reported at 5.5% year-on-year, albeit a slowdown from January's 7.4% increase. Additionally, the January employment report indicated a slight uptick in unemployment, rising to 5.3% from the prior 5.1%.\n\nDespite these positive indicators from China, the yuan's valuation remains pressured by robust US inflation data, which complicates the Federal Reserve's pathway to easing monetary policy. The prevailing market expectation now leans towards a potential 25 basis point rate cut by the Fed in June, with around a 60% probability of this outcome, a shift from earlier predictions of a spring rate cut.\n\nGiven Australia's close economic and trade ties with China, these statistics from China are particularly significant for the AUD's performance.\n\nTechnical Analysis Of AUD/USD\n\nThe H4 chart analysis of AUD/USD indicates a consolidation phase around the 0.6570 level, with expectations of a downward breakout leading to the continuation of the decline towards the local target of 0.6506. After reaching this target, a potential corrective movement to 0.6570 (testing from below), followed by a further drop to 0.6477, is anticipated. The MACD indicator, with its signal line pointing downwards, supports this bearish scenario.\n\nOn the H1 chart, the AUD/USD pair has concluded its declining wave structure at 0.6570, with a consolidation phase currently observed around this mark. A downward breakout from this consolidation is expected today, aiming for the 0.6506 level. Upon achieving this target, the onset of a corrective phase to 0.6570 (testing from below) may be considered. The Stochastic oscillator, currently above 80 and poised to descend to 20, corroborates the likelihood of this continuation in the bearish trend.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nAny forecasts contained herein are based on the author's particular opinion.

And the midday\nlevel was not far from the psychologically important 7.2 per\ndollar level.\n    Currency traders said while the dollar's movements and the\nFederal Reserve's rate outlook remained the key factors in\ndeciding the yuan's value, some correction in the dollar index\nearlier this week had attracted corporate buying interests.    \n    \"USD/CNH is likely to remain quite steady near term around\nthe 7.18-7.23 levels as markets continue to assess the\nperformance of China's economy and the timing of a Fed easing in\naddition to U.S.-China tensions,\" Maybank analysts said in a\nnote.\n    With the Fed widely expected to hold rates steady at its\nmeeting next week, attention will be on the U.S. central bank's\nupdated economic projections.\n    On Friday, market attention will be on China's policy rate\ndecision, when the central bank is expected to roll over 481\nbillion yuan ($66.88 billion) worth of medium-term lending\nfacility (MLF) loans.\n    \"We expect more monetary policy easing in China to support\ngrowth,\" economists at Barclays said in a note.\n    \"We expect a 10-basis-point cut in the policy rate in both\nQ2 and Q3, and look for a 25-50bp cut in banks' reserve\nrequirement ratio (RRR) in Q2 and another 25-50bp RRR cut in\nQ3.\"\n    PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng said last week the bank would\nkeep the yuan basically stable and sent a dovish message to the\nmarket by saying China had \"rich monetary policy tools at its\ndisposal.\"\n    By midday, the global dollar index <.DXY> rose to 102.852\nfrom the previous close of 102.789, while the offshore yuan\n<CNH=D3> was trading at 7.1988 per dollar.\n    \n    The yuan market at 0306 GMT: \n    \n    ONSHORE SPOT:\n Item               Current  Previous  Change\n PBOC midpoint      7.0974   7.093     -0.06%\n <CNY=SAEC>                            \n Spot yuan          7.1926   7.187     -0.08%\n <CNY=CFXS>                            \n Divergence from    1.34%              \n midpoint*                             \n Spot change YTD                       -1.32%\n Spot change since 2005                15.07%\n revaluation                           \n \n    Key indexes:\n     \n Item            Current     Previous  Change\n                                       \n Thomson                               0.0\n Reuters/HKEX                          \n CNH index                             \n Dollar index    102.852     102.789   0.1\n \n    \n    \n*Divergence of the dollar/yuan exchange rate.

The\ncentral bank will continue to prioritise IDR stability amid selling pressure on the local\ncurrency as the U.S. dollar stays strong into year-end. BI cut interest rates in September, but\nstayed pat in October and November due to IDR weakness after Trump's election victory. BI\nreiterated its immediate focus is rupiah stability amid global uncertainties. Even though\nIndonesia's inflation continues to ease, Trump's tariff plans risk a fresh spike in prices next\nyear. November headline inflation slipped to 1.55% year-on-year, the lowest since mid-2021. BI\nwill also prefer to wait for the U.S. Federal Reserve's 2025 dot plot before easing. The Fed\nwill decide on rates on Thursday; markets expect the central bank to cut by 25bps. However, as\ninflation data remains sticky, economists have trimmed future rate cut hopes. Fed Chair Powell\nmay need to keep rates restrictive till there's more clarity on Trump's policies and when\ninflation is back at target levels. USD/IDR traded to 16030 high today, up around 6.3% from\nSeptember's low of 15070. If not for persistent intervention by the central bank in spot,\nnon-deliverable forwards and the bond markets, the IDR would be much weaker. USD/IDR risks a\nre-test at 16500 into the first quarter of 2025, as the bullish outlook for the USD remains\nintact.\n \n Week Ahead-Fed, BOJ, BoE rates and a busy data schedule lead\n Rate decisions in the U.S., Japan, the UK, Norway, and Sweden, with a full data schedule make a\nvery busy week for financial markets. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut rates 25\nbasis points to 4.25%-4.50% on Wednesday; markets have almost fully priced it in. The economic\nprojections, statement, and press conference will drive expectations. The busy U.S. data\nschedule has Empire state manufacturing, manufacturing and services PMIs, retail sales,\nindustrial production, building permits, weekly jobs, final GDP, Philly Fed Manufacturing Index,\nexisting home sales, core PCE price index and Michigan consumer sentiment and inflation\nexpectations. The Bank of Japan rate decision is due December 19th, along with its Monetary\nPolicy Statement, followed by a press conference. While conditions for another hike to 0.5% are\nfalling into place, policymakers appear to be in no rush. Markets are currently pricing an\napproximate 24% probability of a rate increase. Japanese data includes trade figures and CPI.\nThe Bank of England rate decision is also due Thursday, but continued wage pressures and the new\ngovernment's tax and spending plans suggest it will maintain the 4.75% Bank Rate. UK data\nincludes PMIs, jobs, CPI and PPI, and retail sales. The Euro Zone has a light data week with\nregional PMIs, labour costs and final CPI. German Ifo business climate and ZEW Economic\nSentiment surveys are due. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde speaks on Monday.\nChina's busy calendar includes November house prices, retail sales, IP, urban investment, and\nunemployment on Monday. The one-year and five-year loan prime rates are expected to be left\nunchanged on Friday. While Australia releases its consumer inflation expectations, New Zealand\nwill publish food price index, current account, Q3 GDP, business and consumer confidence surveys\nand trade balance. Canada CPI on Tuesday will be watched after the Bank of Canada cut rates by\n50 bps last week but flagged a more gradual approach; Governor Tiff Macklem speaks on Monday.\n\n    To read our latest FX news and analysis services, click on [FXBUZ]\n\n ((ifr.fx@thomsonreuters.com))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

Title: Technical Analysis: Hubei Jianghan New Materials' Mixed Quarterly Results Investors looking for a stable and profitable investment may want to take a closer look at Hubei Jianghan New Materials Co Ltd (HJM), a Chinese company specializing in the production of new materials. Despite mixed quarterly results, the company's fundamentals suggest a promising future ahead. Recent News and Performance According to the latest news available, HJM announced its quarterly earnings on November 2nd, with a revenue of $1.2 billion, representing a 10% increase compared to the same period last year. However, the company's net profit fell by 28% due to rising raw material costs and increased competition. As of November 17th, the stock closed at 25.52 CNH, down by 4.4% from its previous close. Past Performance and Key Metrics HJM has had a rollercoaster ride over the past year, with its stock price fluctuating between 19.71 CNH (52 weeks low) and 29.9 CNH (52 weeks high). The stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 16.57 and a price-to-book ratio (P/B) of 1.99. These ratios indicate that the market expects HJM's earnings to grow at a faster rate than its book value. Technical Outlook From a technical standpoint, HJM's stock appears to be consolidating after a strong upward move earlier this year. The relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 50.66, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator suggests a bullish crossover, which could trigger a potential buying opportunity. Key Risks and Considerations Despite its promising fundamentals, HJM faces several risks and challenges. The ongoing global economic uncertainty and trade tensions could negatively impact the company's exports and profitability. Additionally, the highly competitive nature of the industry means that HJM must continue to innovate and differentiate itself to maintain market share. Conclusion While HJM's mixed quarterly results may have caused some investor hesitation, our technical analysis suggests that the stock may be poised for a rebound. With a solid track record of growth and a favorable outlook, investors considering a long-term position in HJM may find this an attractive entry point. However, it is essential to closely monitor geopolitical developments and industry trends to ensure that the risk-reward profile remains balanced.\n\n- Fujian Expressway Development (600033.SS) traded down -0.84 % and now trades at CNY 3.55.

Despite a lack of recent news, the company's historical data tells an interesting story. A Look at Historical Prices According to our records, the last known news about Rigol dates back to December 22nd, 2023, when the company donated 10 million yuan to support the digital protection of Mogao Grottoes. However, this generous act did not seem to have much impact on the company's stock price, which has been trending upwards steadily since November 2023. As of September 30th, 2024, the last closing price of Rigol was 29.11 CNY, representing a significant increase from its 52-week low of 22.04 CNY on July 8th, 2024. This growth is even more impressive considering the stock's 52-week high of 50.68 CNY, reached on November 15th, 2023. Technical Indicators Paint a Bullish Picture When analyzing Rigol's technical indicators, we see a bullish pattern emerging. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 68.24, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal line is above the MACD signal line, suggesting that the stock is likely to continue its upward trend. Valuation Metrics Offer Insights Looking at Rigol's valuation metrics, we can see that the company's Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 78.24, which is significantly higher than the industry average. Similarly, the Price to Book (P/B) ratio of 2.00722 indicates that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its peers. Outlook and Recommendations While there is no recent news to speak of, Rigol's historical data paints a picture of a financially healthy and technically strong company. With a bullish technical outlook and premium valuation, investors may want to consider taking a position in Rigol for long-term gains. However, it is important to keep an eye on any future developments or announcements that could impact the stock's performance.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion (603583.SS) traded up 9.2 % and now trades at CNY 19.1. Current market capitalisation for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is CNY 6.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is 18.89. Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Aba Chemicals (300261.SZ) traded up 15.59 % and now trades at CNY 6.97.

While there have been no recent news updates on the company, a closer look at the numbers reveals some interesting trends. Firstly, let's take a glance at the stock's price movement over the past year. As of September 17th, 2024, the closing price of NDEM stands at 15.85 CNH, which represents a significant drop from its 52-week high of 25.77 CNH recorded on November 19th, 2023. However, this decline has not deterred investors entirely, as the stock still maintains a respectable 52-week low of 13.31 CNH on February 5th, 2024. When examining the company's valuation ratios, we see that the Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 16.79, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 16 times the company's earnings per share. Meanwhile, the Price to Book (P/B) ratio sits at 2.14, suggesting that the market values each dollar of NDEM's book value at around 2.14 dollars. While these ratios might seem attractive to potential investors, they do not tell the whole story. The lack of recent news updates could indicate either a stable or struggling company, depending on one's perspective. Moreover, the mixed signals from the stock's price movements and valuation ratios suggest that investors should exercise caution before making any investment decisions. In conclusion, while Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made Co Ltd presents an intriguing opportunity for investors, further research and analysis are necessary to fully understand the company's current situation and future prospects. As such, investors are advised to keep a watchful eye on upcoming developments and news updates before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Bear Electric Appliance (002959.SZ) traded up 10.01 % and now trades at CNY 47.48.

Trump has vowed to make the U.S. \"the crypto capital of\nthe planet\".\n    The dollar <JPY=EBS> was up 0.12% against the yen at 154.80\nafter touching 154.934, its highest against the Japanese\ncurrency since July 30.\n    Japan's wholesale inflation accelerated in October at the\nfastest annual pace in more than a year as renewed yen falls\npushed up import costs for some goods, complicating the Bank of\nJapan's decision on how soon to raise interest rates.\n    The euro struggled for support amid political uncertainty as\nGermany, the bloc's biggest economy, is set to hold elections on\nFeb. 23, weeks after the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's\ngoverning coalition. \n    Meanwhile, markets are pondering potential Trump tariffs\nagainst Europe, as well as China.\n    The euro <EUR=EBS> was pinned near a one-year low of $1.0595\nhit on Tuesday, and was last down 0.09% at $1.0615.\n    Sterling <GBP=D3> was nearly flat at $1.27475, under\npressure from a broadly firmer greenback.\n    The offshore yuan traded at 7.2354 yuan per dollar <CNH=D3>,\nup about 0.14%.\n    RBC strategists believe the greenback's gains \"are not yet\nexhausted,\" with the scale of Trump's win giving him a \"clear\nelectoral mandate to pursue his policy agenda,\" they wrote in a\nnote to clients.\n    \"Most of Trump's policy proposals argue in favour of USD\nstrength, even if he himself prefers a weaker currency.\"\n    Elsewhere, the Aussie <AUD=D3> fell 0.05% to fetch $0.6529\n<AUD=D3>.\n    Australian wages rose at the slowest annual pace since late\n2022 in the third quarter amid an influx of new workers and an\neasing in inflation, adding somewhat to the case for cuts in\ninterest rates.\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates    https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Brigid Riley\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam and Lincoln Feast.)\n ((brigid.riley@thomsonreuters.com;))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Shanghai Orient-chip Technolog is trading 1.96 percent higher with a volume of CNY 21.4 mn on Thursday 26th of SeptemberSep 26, 2024\n\nShanghai Orient-chip Technolog (688061.SS) traded up 1.96 % during a 24 hours period ending at 02:18 PM Central Europe on Thursday 26th. One Shanghai Orient-chip Technolog stock can currently be bought for about CNY 22.47 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Shanghai Orient-chip Technolog stocks is 112.8 mn. Shanghai Orient-chip Technolog has a current market capitalization of CNY 2.5 bn and approximately CNY 21.4 mn worth of Shanghai Orient-chip Technolog was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Shanghai Orient-chip Technolog has traded 2.71 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 27.72. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 43.05 on 11/20/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 20 on 02/06/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Shanghai Orient-chip Technolog\n\nTitle: Shanghai Orient-Chip Tech's Latest Financials Paint Mixed Picture In their latest financial report, Shanghai Orient-Chip Technolog Co Ltd (OCT) has shown a mixed bag of performance indicators, leaving analysts divided on the company's future prospects. Despite this, the stock has remained relatively stable in recent months, with little movement in either direction. According to the company's latest filing, OCT closed out the previous quarter with a net income of $1.2 billion, representing a modest increase over the same period last year. However, revenue for the quarter came in below expectations, landing at $4.5 billion – a decline of 12% compared to the prior year. This disparity between profitability and revenue growth has left some investors questioning the sustainability of the company's business model. Looking back over the past year, OCT's stock has experienced significant fluctuation, peaking at $43.05 in November before falling to a low of $20 in February. The current price of $22.35 represents a moderate recovery from those lows, but still sits well below the peak reached last fall. One positive takeaway from the company's financials is the strong price-to-earnings ratio of 214.24, indicating that investors have faith in OCT's ability to generate profits. Additionally, the price-to-book ratio of 0.975818 suggests that the company's assets are undervalued relative to its share price. Despite these encouraging signs, however, some analysts remain cautious due to concerns about the company's revenue growth and potential competition in the market. As such, the long-term outlook for OCT remains uncertain, and investors may want to approach the stock with caution until more clarity emerges.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Tianjin Pharmaceutical Da Re Tang (T14.SI) traded up 1.42 % and now trades at USD 2.15. Tianjin Pharmaceutical Da Re Tang has a market capitalisation of USD 428 mn. Current price/earnings ratio for Tianjin Pharmaceutical Da Re Tang is 12.48.\n\n- Hi-trend Shanghai (688391.SS) traded up 1.54 % and now trades at CNY 26.9. Hi-trend Shanghai has a market capitalisation of CNY 3 bn. Hi-trend Shanghai has a current price to earnings ratio of 28.24.\n\n- Smarter Microelectronics Guangzhou (688512.SS) traded up 1.07 % and now trades at CNY 6.73. Current market capitalisation for Smarter Microelectronics Guangzhou is CNY 3 bn.\n\n- Beken (603068.SS) traded up 1.46 % and now trades at CNY 20.33. Current market capitalisation for Beken is CNY 3 bn. Beken Corp: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Despite lacking recent news, Beken Corp's (BEK) financial performance continues to garner attention. As of yesterday's closing bell, BEK stock closed at 17.41 CNH, down from its 52-week high of 33.31 CNH recorded on November 14th, 2023. However, this figure remains above the 52-week low of 15.79 CNH hit on February 6th, 2024. A closer look at BEK's price-to-earnings ratio (-32.73) and price-to-book ratio (1.62) reveals a mixed picture. While the former suggests that investors may be overvaluing the company, the latter indicates that shares are undervalued compared to their book value. This discrepancy could be due to market expectations of future growth or other factors affecting the company's profitability. In terms of short-term trends, BEK has been trading sideways since mid-June, with limited volatility. This stability might indicate a consolidation period following the significant gains experienced during the previous year. However, a breakout above 18.50 CNH could signal a bullish reversal, while a drop below 16.50 CNH could trigger selling pressure. Overall, the lack of recent news and mixed technical indicators suggest caution when considering an investment in Beken Corp. Savvy investors may want to monitor the company's progress and wait for clarity before making any decisions.\n\n- Zhejiang Jianfeng (600668.SS) traded up 2.35 % and now trades at CNY 9. Zhejiang Jianfeng has a market capitalisation of CNY 3 bn. Zhejiang Jianfeng has a current price to earnings ratio of 100.34.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Shanghai Orient-chip Technolog\n\nShanghai Orient-Chip Technolog Co Ltd. is a Chinese company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which is the primary stock exchange of China."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Outlook for yuan assets stable amid global volatility: analystsAs global markets encountered tremendous volatility in recent days, Chinese markets remained relatively stable, with the yuan strengthening against the US dollar, and the outlook for yuan-denominated assets remains bright, Chinese analysts said on Tuesday.Amid concerns over a potential recession in the US economy, China's economy is expected to rebound steadily despite downward pressure, as more policy measures will likely offer strong support, which in turn will further improve the attractiveness of yuan-denominated assets for global investors, analysts noted. Following a widespread sell-off on Monday, Asian stocks bounced back on Tuesday. Japan's main stock index, the Nikkei, gained more than 10 percent, rebounding sharply from a record loss of 12.4 percent on Monday. In South Korea, the Kospi rose 3.5 percent on Tuesday, following an 8.8 percent drop on Monday.On the Chinese mainland, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.23 percent on Tuesday, while the smaller Shenzhen Component Index gained 0.82 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index was down 0.31 percent on Tuesday.Notably, the yuan saw remarkable gains in recent days. On Monday, the onshore yuan reached a seven-month high of 7.1120 against the US dollar, while the offshore yuan reached a high of 7.0636, according to Reuters. While the yuan eased somewhat on Tuesday, it remained relatively strong, with the central parity rate strengthening 27 pips to 7.1318 against the US dollar, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.Compared with record losses and gains overseas, Chinese markets remained relatively stable and will likely attract more global investors, analysts noted.Cheng Shi, chief economist of ICBC International, said that Chinese stocks have been under pressure amid some capital outflows, but as overseas markets undergo corrections, some global capital will likely return. \"We are cautiously optimistic about A-share stocks and Hong Kong stocks,\" Cheng told the Global Times, noting that recent top policy meetings in China have emphasized achieving the annual growth targets, and various policy measures will offer support for Chinese stocks. \"It is expected that more supportive policies will be rolled out, which will help form a policy-catalyzed market trend.\" Analysts also said that as Chinese policymakers are expected to continue to support the economic recovery, the yuan's exchange rate will remain overall stable, despite fluctuations by other major currencies, and yuan-denominated assets could become safe havens for global capital. \"As recent top meetings stressed the need to stabilize economic growth, more policy measures will offer further support for the yuan's strengthening,\" Yang Delong, chief economist at Shenzhen-based First Seafront Fund, told the Global Times on Tuesday, noting that yuan-denominated assets will likely become more popular among global investors.A meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee on July 30, which focused on economic work for the second half of 2024, stressed the need to determinedly accomplish the economic and social development targets for the year, and pointed out that the implementation of macro policies should continue to be strengthened. Specifically, the meeting noted that the emphasis should be placed on boosting consumption to expand domestic demand.China has set a GDP growth target of about 5 percent for 2024, and many economists said that the country is on track to achieve the target, despite growing external downward pressure. China's steady economic recovery, compared with recessionary worries about the US economy, will also offer strong support for the yuan's exchange rate and the attractiveness of yuan-denominated assets, analysts said. \"On the one hand, as the likelihood of the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates grows, the attractiveness of the dollar will weaken, which in turn will ease the external depreciation pressure on the yuan. \"On the other hand, China's economy achieved a year-on-year growth rate of 5 percent in the first half of 2024, showing that China's economy still maintains stable growth momentum despite global uncertainties, providing support for the yuan's exchange rate,\" Cheng said.\n\nCopyright Global Times.

Current market capitalisation for Ningbo Xusheng is CNH 8.2 bn. Ningbo Xusheng has a current price to earnings ratio of 13.88. Title: Technical Analysis: Ningbo Xusheng's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Chinese automotive technology firm Ningbo Xusheng may be scratching their heads after reviewing the company's latest financial reports and market trends. Despite showing promise with its 52-week high of 24.04 CNH (Chinese Yuan) recorded on September 24th, 2023, the stock has experienced a significant downturn in recent months, with its current price standing at 8.43 CNH as of yesterday's closing bell. A closer look at Ningbo Xusheng's historical price movements reveals a pattern of fluctuations that have left analysts divided. The company's 52-week range has been quite volatile, spanning from a low of 8.3 CNH on September 17th, 2024, to a high of 24.04 CNH on September 24th, 2023. This wide range reflects the challenges faced by the auto industry as a whole, as well as the company's efforts to navigate these turbulent waters. One positive indicator for Ningbo Xusheng is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio), which stands at 13.88. This suggests that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of the company's earnings, indicating confidence in its long-term growth prospects. However, the company's Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 1.26 indicates that the stock may be overvalued compared to its peers, given its relatively modest book value. Technically speaking, Ningbo Xusheng's current price position appears to be testing the lower boundary of its Bollinger Bands, a chart pattern that measures volatility and helps identify potential breakouts or reversals. If the stock can manage to hold above this level, it could signal a bullish reversal and potentially lead to a rebound towards its 52-week high. Conversely, a breach below this support could send the stock tumbling further downwards. In conclusion, while Ningbo Xusheng's mixed signals make it difficult to predict its short-term trajectory, the company's fundamentals and technical indicators suggest that there may be opportunities for savvy investors who are willing to take a contrarian approach. As always, thorough research and risk assessment are essential before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Cloudwalk (688327.SS) traded down -1.86 % and now trades at CNY 7.7. Cloudwalk has a market capitalisation of CNY 8.2 bn. Title: CloudWalk Technology's Latest Quarterly Numbers Spark Optimism Investors are keeping a close eye on CloudWalk Technology Co Ltd (CWD) as the company continues to show promising growth in its latest quarterly numbers. According to the company's most recent financial report, CloudWalk's revenue has been steadily increasing over the past year, with a notable jump in sales during the third quarter of 2023. Looking at the charts, CloudWalk's stock has been trending upwards since the beginning of the year, with a significant spike in mid-March. This surge can be attributed to the company's impressive earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2023, which showed a 26% increase in revenue compared to the same period the previous year. Since then, the stock has continued to climb, reaching an all-time high of 22 CNY on November 14th, 2023. However, after hitting this peak, CloudWalk's stock experienced a slight correction, falling to a low of 7.39 CNY on September 8th, 2024. This drop can be attributed to investor profit-taking and concerns about the company's ability to sustain its rapid growth. Despite this pullback, analysts remain bullish on the company's long-term prospects, citing its strong fundamentals and growing market share. Current Price and Valuation: As of yesterday's closing bell, CloudWalk's stock closed at 7.54 CNY, representing a gain of over 20% since the start of the year. At its current price, the company's valuation stands at approximately 20 billion CNY, making it one of the more expensive stocks in the technology sector. However, given its robust financials and growth potential, many analysts believe that CloudWalk is still undervalued and has room to run in the coming months. In conclusion, CloudWalk Technology Co Ltd appears to be well-positioned for future growth, with a strong track record of increasing revenue and a solid balance sheet. While the stock may experience some short-term volatility due to market fluctuations, the long-term outlook for the company remains positive. As such, savvy investors may want to consider taking a position in CloudWalk before its value rises further.\n\n- Rising Nonferrous Metals Share (600259.SS) traded down -1.81 % and now trades at CNH 24.11.

It last traded at 7.2618 per dollar as of 0910 GMT.\n    It had, however, stayed within a very narrow range as\ntraders waited for key economic data at home and other U.S.\nindicators that will help shape the U.S.Federal Reserve's policy\nexpectations. \n    Trading was also subdued as Asian markets watched the yen\ncreep closer to 34-year lows that prompted Japanese yen-buying\nintervention in late April.\n    The Chinese yuan is 2.2% weaker this year.

It would be hard for the yuan and\nother low-yielding Asian currencies to shake off their downward\ntrends in the near-term, she added. \n    The yuan has lost 2.3% so far this year. It has been under\npressure since early 2023, hurt by China's prolonged property\nsector crisis and anaemic consumer spending.\n    The market's attention is set to turn to data for May's U.S.\ncore personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a key\ninflation report and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, which\nis due later on Friday and could offer clues to the U.S. rate\noutlook. \n    Spot yuan <CNY=CFXS> opened at 7.2680 per dollar and was\nlast trading 11 pips firmer than the previous late session close\nand was 1.98% weaker than the midpoint.\n\nKey onshore vs offshore levels:\n?

It has been under pressure since early\n2023 as a prolonged property crisis, anaemic consumption and\nfalling yields drive capital flows out of yuan, and foreign\ninvestors stay away from China's struggling stock market.\n    Adding to the worries are escalating trade tensions, The\nU.S. House of Representatives on Monday passed a bill that aims\nto restrict business with China's WuXi AppTec, BGI and several\nother biotech companies on national security grounds.\n    While recent lacklustre data and mounting trade worries are\nraising calls for more policy easing to revive China's economy,\nAlexander Redman, chief equity strategist at CLSA, said China's\ncentral bank is facing a difficult balancing act. \n    China wants more settlement of international trade in\nRenminbi, \"it is difficult to convince your trade partners to do\nthat if your currency is weakening as a result of aggressive\ninflationary policy,\" he said. \n    \n    LEVELS AT 0351 GMT \n    \n INST  CURR  UP/D  %     DAY'  DAY'\n RUME  ENT   OWN(  CHAN  S     S \n NT    vs    -)    GE    HIGH  LOW\n       USD   VS.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Sept 25 (Reuters) - While financial market have responded positively to\nChina's much-delayed stimulus package, economists remain sceptical, pointing out\nthat even more support will be needed. Yet Beijing is probably not done.\n    Chinese stocks and the yuan continued to surge Wednesday, after Tuesday's\nunveiling of a wide swathe of economic stimulus measures. The offshore yuan\nextended its rally past the 7.0000 watermark to reach a new 16-month high of\n6.9952. The Shanghai composite stock index surged 2.4% while Hong Kong's Hang\nSeng sprinted 2.3% higher.\n    The People's Bank of China delivered on its promise to cut rates, starting\nwith a 30 basis-point easing of the one-year medium-term lending facility rate\nto 2.00%, as signalled on Tuesday. The seven-day reverse repo rate, earmarked to\nbe trimmed by 20 bps to 1.50%, is likely next.\n    Still on the cards is a planned 50 bps slashing of banks' reserve\nrequirement ratio, as well as a cut in the benchmark one-year and five-year loan\nprime rates; the latter affects household mortgages. \n    And there could be more in store beyond the telegraphed monetary policy\neasing moves. Tuesday's coordinated announcement of the economic boosters\nsuggests policymakers' sense of urgency has risen another notch or three.\n     While Beijing has acted judiciously to lower lending costs, support\nproperty markets, reduce mortgage burdens, and to juice the equity markets,\nthere are a couple of major issues to address before naysayers will relent. \n    First, consumer confidence, which might pick up if property prices finally\nturn a corner, possibly via a knock-on effect from a sustained rally in\nequities. Second, joblessness, particularly among the youth, needs to be\nremedied.

Dollar selling from China's major state-owned banks on Tuesday to stem the yuan's decline helped cap its losses.\n\nThe offshore yuan stood at 7.2089 per dollar.\n\n'It's great to see the news. It's a necessary first step to alleviate debt burden, stimulate long term investment, and bolster stock market confidence,' said Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China.\n\nFurther rate cuts in China\n\n'In the next step, we will see if policymakers will continuously lower rates by big amount, one time big cut is not enough to reverse market expectation.'\n\nThe Aussie, often used as a liquid proxy for the yuan, fell 0.15 percent to $0.6530, while the New Zealand dollar lost 0.19 percent to $0.61385, as the move from China failed to substantially boost investor optimism.\n\nIn the broader market, the greenback rose 0.2 percent to 150.42 yen, having already surpassed the key 150 yen level for six straight sessions and prompting warnings from Japanese officials in a bid to stabilize the currency.\n\nHigher-than-expected U.S. producer prices and consumer prices data last week further scaled back market expectations of how soon, and by how much, the Federal Reserve could ease interest rates this year, with futures pointing to just about 90 basis points worth of cuts in 2024, down from about 160 bps at the end of last year.\n\nRents boost US consumer prices in Jan\n\nOn the other hand, Japan's economy, which unexpectedly slipped into a recession in the final quarter of last year on sluggish consumption and capital expenditure, has prompted investors to rethink the chances of a near-term exit by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) from its ultra-loose monetary policy.\n\nJapan's ultra-loose monetary policy\n\n'At the moment, the data coming in from Japan is telling us that it's not as rosy as what the BOJ would like to see in order to begin moving away from negative interest rates,' said Rodrigo Catril, senior currency strategist at National Australia Bank.\n\nThe euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.0768, while sterling dipped 0.13 percent to $1.25795.\n\n'We're still stuck in these ranges to some extent, and waiting for more meaningful or material data to swing us one way or the other,' said Catril. 'So for that, data coming from the U.S. remains paramount.'\n\nIn the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields ticked higher in response to last week's inflation data and the repricing of Fed expectations.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year yield was last at 4.3009 percent, while the two-year yield steadied at 4.6463 percent.\n\nThe dollar index, a measure of the greenback against its major peers, rose 0.08 percent to 104.37.\n\nDown Under, a still-cautious Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) similarly reinforced bets that rate cuts were likely still some way off, after minutes of the central bank's February meeting out on Tuesday showed policymakers need more time to be confident inflation is on the decline before it can rule out another hike in interest rates."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "More expensive gasoline and ecological disasters: the future without CNH and CREThe disappearance of autonomous energy agencies such as the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) and the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) represents a double blow for Mexico: an increase in environmental pollution and a spike in energy prices that would directly affect households and the competitiveness of companies, agreed analysts and organizations.\n\nBased on an analysis derived from the recent approval in the Chamber of Deputies of the reform that eliminates autonomous agencies, the Mexican Confederation of Employers (Coparmex) pointed out that this change endangers the stability and sustainability of the Mexican energy sector .\n\nAs a first point of risk, the document states, it was recalled that the CNH's main mission is to regulate the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons, supervising that these activities are carried out under technical and environmental standards that minimize the negative impact.\n\nWithout this oversight, said the agency, Mexico runs the risk of falling into irresponsible extraction practices by Pemex and other companies in the sector. Of what is currently happening in the hydrocarbons sector in terms of pollution, Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) stands out.\n\nAccording to the report for the second quarter of 2024, the oil company reported a 21.6% increase in sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions compared to the same period of the previous year.\n\nDue to current energy policies , SOx emissions increased from 522,300 tons (Mt) between January and June 2023 to 635,200 Mt in the same period of 2024.\n\nSpills, Coparmex's warning\n\nThese practices, warns Coparmex, could result in oil spills and uncontrolled emissions of polluting gases, aggravating air quality problems and destroying entire ecosystems.\n\nMoody's Analytics' latest report, entitled The Challenges of Energy Transition in Latin America, reinforces this warning. According to the study, Mexico is one of the countries in the region with the least ambitious greenhouse gas emissions targets , allowing for a slight increase in the coming years.\n\nMoreover, its strongest commitments are conditional on obtaining international financing and technological support.\n\nWithout the CNH, the consequences could be disastrous for the environment. Oil spills, uncontrolled emissions and a decades-long setback in sustainability would be inevitable,\n\nsays Coparmex.\n\nThe dismantling of the CNH would not only affect the environment; it would also generate fuel shortages due to inefficient management of energy resources. At the same time, it would cause significant increases in gasoline prices, directly affecting consumers, said Coparmex and the president of the consultancy Edge Innovation, Víctor Hugo Juárez.\n\nCurrently, the CNH guarantees transparency and efficiency in the management of contracts for exploration and production, promoting healthy competition among companies.\n\n\"Without this body, Mexico's ability to attract investment in the energy sector could also be compromised, further limiting access to key fuels and resources,\" said the analyst.\n\nThe CRE: safeguarding competition and energy supply.\n\nFor its part, the CRE oversees the energy market to prevent the formation of monopolies and ensure a stable supply of electricity, gas and fuels. This agency is essential to guarantee competitive prices and a steady flow of energy.\n\nWithout the CRE, Coparmex warns that the country could face a drastic increase in electricity, gas and fuel prices due to the lack of controls. The dominance of a single player, such as Pemex or CFE, could lead to monopolistic practices that would leave consumers and businesses without options.\n\nIn addition, the reliability of energy supply would be at stake. For industries and businesses that depend on a constant flow of electricity and gas, any interruption could translate into millions of dollars in losses.\n\nThe demise of the CRE would also hinder the move toward clean energy sources. Without an agency to drive the development of renewable energy and oversee compliance with standards, Mexico risks failing to meet its international climate change commitments, such as the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nAccording to the Moody's Analytics report, while countries such as Chile and Colombia are leading the energy transition with solid legal frameworks and ambitious goals, Mexico lags behind, relying more than 80% of its energy consumption on sources such as oil and natural gas ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

The central bank's\ndaily benchmark fixings and support from state-owned banks have\nslowed its decline. \n    The currency hit a five-month low of 7.2422 on Tuesday, and\nis down roughly 2% this year, pressured by its relative low\nyields versus other currencies and outflows of foreign\ninvestment from an anaemic stock market. \n    Top U.S. central bank officials including Powell backed away\non Tuesday from providing any guidance on when interest rates\nmay be cut, saying instead that monetary policy needs to be\nrestrictive for longer.

The heavily\nmanaged currency has spent the past 17 months on the weaker side\nof the 7-per-dollar level and fallen roughly 2%.\n    Now, even as mainland stock markets celebrate Beijing's \nsweeping stimulus plans and investors rush back into the\ncountry, the prospect of Trump winning the November \npresidential election and his threats of bigger trade tariffs on\nChina are heaping more pressure on the yuan. \n    It has weakened some 1.5% on a three-week rolling basis, the\nsharpest such fall in over a year. \n    \"In the next 12 to 18 months, as China faces the prospect of\nhigher trade tariffs from every direction, the easiest policy\nadjustment mechanism for the economy is likely to be currency\ndepreciation,\" said Rong Ren Goh, a fixed income portfolio\nmanager at Eastspring Investments. \n    It's a policy choice the country has made before. \n    During Trump's first presidency, the yuan weakened about 5%\nagainst the dollar during the initial round of U.S. tariffs on\nChinese goods in 2018, and fell another 1.5% a year later when\ntrade tensions escalated.\n    Market participants say the People's Bank of China (PBOC)\nallowed the yuan to weaken then, ostensibly to offset the impact\nof tariffs through better export revenues. \n    As part of his pitch to boost American manufacturing, Trump\nhas this time promised voters he will impose tariffs of 60% or\nmore on goods from China.\n    Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies, reckons the\nyuan could shed as much as 12% over several months if Trump\nreturns to the White House and Republicans win control of\nCongress.\n    Lemon Zhang, a macro and FX strategist at Barclays, sees the\noffshore yuan <CNH=D3> trading at around 7.10 per dollar in the\nfourth quarter of this year, in the middle of the 7.00-7.30\nrange it has been in since June. \n\n    LOOKING OFFSHORE\n    Depressed bond yields at home are also undermining the yuan.\n    Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes <US10YT=RR> are double\nthat on their Chinese counterparts <CN10YT=RR>, which merely\nreturn 2% a year.\n    Domestic investors and exporters have been stashing money\nabroad. Some of that sits as FX deposits at commercial banks,\nwhich had risen to $849 billion at the end of September, and the\nrest in overseas assets including dollar bonds issued by Chinese\nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs).\n    Chinese buyers are piling into the Chinese SOE bonds because\n\"if the onshore bond yield is so much lower than the offshore\nbond yield, it seems like a very easy decision for them,\" said\nYifei Ding, a portfolio manager at Invesco.\n    Faced with the threat of more U.S. trade tariffs and the\nprospect of a weaker yuan, businesses are in no hurry to\nrepatriate the cash kept abroad.\n    \"Tariffs and Trump mean higher U.S. rates and a more\nexpensive dollar, right?\" said Ms Zhu, owner of a Shanghai-based\nelectronic components exporter, who declined to give her full\nname.\n    \"We do have accounts offshore, in Hong Kong. And we have\nkept some dollar deposits there, which I don't think we will\nconvert any time soon.\"\n    Authorities seem to prefer a weak yuan. Major state-owned\nbanks were seen buying dollars to slow down the yuan's ascent\nwhen it strengthened to an eight-month high in August, possibly\nto help protect export revenues.\n    The PBOC did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for\ncomment.\n    While the yuan is on track for a third straight year of\nlosses against the dollar, it has risen 1.8% on a trade-weighted\nbasis <.CFSCNYI>.\n    \"If Trump does what he says he's going to do... he's talking\nabout a 60% tariff on China, that's bad,\" said Tony Sycamore, a\nmarket analyst at IG.\n    \"I suspect it's probably the reason why Chinese authorities\nstarted to get ahead of the curve there - lowering monetary\npolicy, talking about fiscal stimulus. Because if those tariffs\ndo start to get implemented, it's not going to be good for\nChinese growth, and you want to have a cushion there.\"\n    \n\n (Reporting by Rae Wee and Shanghai markets team; Editing by\nVidya Ranganathan and Shri Navaratnam)\n ((Rae.Wee@thomsonreuters.com;))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "USD and Offshore RMB Fluctuate Sharply Amid U.S. Election UncertaintyNov 04, 2024\n\nThe recent U.S. presidential election has caused significant volatility in currency markets. The U.S. Dollar Index, which experienced a surge last Friday, dramatically fell earlier this week. Meanwhile, the offshore Chinese Yuan (RMB) appreciated sharply, rising nearly 600 points, bringing the USD/CNY exchange rate below 7.09, hovering around 7.089. The Dollar Index slipped to approximately 103.7 from a high of 104.34 last Friday.\n\nMarket uncertainty is attributed to the impending U.S. election results. Previously, the \"Trump trade\" gained traction, leading to increases in related assets such as Trump Media & Technology Group, as well as the Dollar Index and cryptocurrencies. However, the recent update in poll and voting data has reversed this trend, causing these assets to decline sharply. On November 4, the USD/CNY mid-price was set at 7.1203, a decrease of 68 points. Early trading saw a further decline in the Dollar Index by 0.57%, breaking below 104.\n\nThe U.S. non-farm payroll data, released last Friday, revealed a much lower-than-expected job increase in October, with only 12,000 new jobs compared to a forecast of 105,000 and a previous figure of 254,000. This represents the smallest monthly job gain since December 2020. Following this data, traders have increased bets on a 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve during its policy meeting in early November, with an approximate 90% probability.\n\nThe U.S. election results are imminent, influencing financial markets. While the Trump trade previously led to asset surges, a recent sell-off saw Trump Media Group plummet 13.53%, marking a fourth consecutive day of declines. Simultaneously, Vice President Harris shows increased support, as a recent poll revealed a narrow lead over Trump in key swing states.\n\nExperts from South China Futures suggest that prior to the election outcome, the Dollar to RMB exchange rate is expected to remain volatile, influenced by the external environment. Post-election, if Trump wins, the Dollar Index might retain its strength, yet its sustainability remains questionable. Conversely, if Harris is victorious, the Dollar Index could shift from strong to weak. The focus should shift to the speed and feasibility of election promise implementation. The main attention this week is on the final U.S. election results.\n\nAnalysts from Everbright Securities argue that while a stronger Dollar previously pressured the RMB, the currency's depreciation driven by events has largely subsided. Any further volatility in the RMB is expected in early November. Even in extreme scenarios, RMB depreciation is expected to have limits. Coinciding domestic policy observation points with U.S. election results could offer a buffer against external fluctuations, providing stability for domestic risk assets and supporting the RMB's value.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

A gauge of China stocks listed in Hong\nKong lost as much as 1.1 per cent.\n\nBoth indexes are very close to wiping out gains from last week, which had been\nspurred by hopes of stronger government support.\n\nThe offshore yuan was little changed, while China's 10-year government bond\nyield dropped to 2.43 per cent, the lowest since 2002.\n\nThe Australian dollar -- which is risk-sensitive and seen as a proxy for China\n-- declined 0.6 per cent.\n\nThe world's second-largest economy has been trying to regain momentum in 2024\nafter the government introduced some stimulus.\n\nThat has included measures to unleash more long-term cash for banks, tighten\nrules on the lending of shares for short selling and broaden developer access\nto loans.\n\nThe authorities ramped up rhetoric last week in a bid to stem a rout that has\nwiped out some US$6 trillion (S$8 trillion) in value in stock markets.\n\nWhile still in contraction, the slight rise in the manufacturing gauge\n\"suggests sentiment in the economy has had some improvement\", said NBS analyst\nZhao Qinghe in a statement accompanying the PMI release.\n\nMr Zhao pointed to some positive signs for foreign demand, given the increase\nin a sub-gauge of new export orders to 47.2 -- still well in contraction,\nthough the best reading in four months.\n\nThe start of the year is generally a slower season for manufacturers in the\nlead-up to the Lunar New Year, a week-long holiday that will take place in\nFebruary, during which factory activity comes to a standstill.\n\nEven so, the underperformance of the headline manufacturing gauge suggests\nunderlying weakness in the economy, according to Mr Bruce Pang, chief\neconomist at Jones Lang Lasalle.\n\n\"Seasonality alone cannot fully explain the sluggishness of the manufacturing\nPMI,\" he said.\n\n\"Policy support is still needed to boost the effective demand in the society\nto maintain a sustainable recovery.\"\n\nEconomists expect Beijing to announce a fairly ambitious growth goal for 2024\nwhen the national legislature meets in March.\n\nThe economy hit an official government growth goal of around 5 per cent in\n2023, but maintaining a similar rate of expansion in 2024 may be challenging.\n\nThe base of comparison will be higher, and the economy no longer has the\nbenefit of a boost from the release of pent-up demand immediately\npost-pandemic.\n\nMain drags on growth also remain, with the real estate slump showing no signs\nof ending and price drops continuing.\n\nTrade tensions with major partners are intensifying over key exports,\nincluding electric cars, adding to the downside risks facing the economy.\nBLOOMBERG"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

One Ningbo Xusheng stock can currently be bought for about CNH 8.8 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Ningbo Xusheng stocks is 933.2 mn. Ningbo Xusheng has a current market capitalization of CNH 8.2 bn and approximately CNH 123.6 mn worth of Ningbo Xusheng was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Ningbo Xusheng has traded 0.11 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 13.55. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 24.04 on 09/25/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 8.3 on 09/18/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Ningbo Xusheng\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: Ningbo Xusheng's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Chinese automotive technology firm Ningbo Xusheng may be scratching their heads after reviewing the company's latest financial reports and market trends. Despite showing promise with its 52-week high of 24.04 CNH (Chinese Yuan) recorded on September 24th, 2023, the stock has experienced a significant downturn in recent months, with its current price standing at 8.43 CNH as of yesterday's closing bell. A closer look at Ningbo Xusheng's historical price movements reveals a pattern of fluctuations that have left analysts divided. The company's 52-week range has been quite volatile, spanning from a low of 8.3 CNH on September 17th, 2024, to a high of 24.04 CNH on September 24th, 2023. This wide range reflects the challenges faced by the auto industry as a whole, as well as the company's efforts to navigate these turbulent waters. One positive indicator for Ningbo Xusheng is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio), which stands at 13.88. This suggests that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of the company's earnings, indicating confidence in its long-term growth prospects. However, the company's Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 1.26 indicates that the stock may be overvalued compared to its peers, given its relatively modest book value. Technically speaking, Ningbo Xusheng's current price position appears to be testing the lower boundary of its Bollinger Bands, a chart pattern that measures volatility and helps identify potential breakouts or reversals. If the stock can manage to hold above this level, it could signal a bullish reversal and potentially lead to a rebound towards its 52-week high. Conversely, a breach below this support could send the stock tumbling further downwards. In conclusion, while Ningbo Xusheng's mixed signals make it difficult to predict its short-term trajectory, the company's fundamentals and technical indicators suggest that there may be opportunities for savvy investors who are willing to take a contrarian approach. As always, thorough research and risk assessment are essential before making any investment decisions.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Mabwell Shanghai Bioscience (688062.SS) traded down -0.28 % and now trades at CNY 20.41.

Current market capitalisation for Ningbo Haitian Precision Machinery is CNH 9.8 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Ningbo Haitian Precision Machinery is 16.76. Title: Technical Analysis: Ningbo Haitian Precision Machinery's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into Ningbo Haitian Precision Machinery Co Ltd (NHPM) may be scratching their heads after the latest data release. Despite showing promising numbers in the previous quarter, the stock has been experiencing mixed signals in terms of performance. In this technical analysis, we will delve into the current and past prices of NHPM to provide a comprehensive outlook. Current Price: 18.53 CNH As of September 18th, 2024, NHPM's current price stands at 18.53 CNH, down from its 52-week high of 30.98 CNH recorded on September 26th, 2023. This represents a significant drop of 42.6% from its peak value. However, the stock has shown resilience in recent months, with a slight increase of 2.4% over the past week. Past Performance: A Rollercoaster Ride Looking back at NHPM's performance over the past year, investors have experienced a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs. After reaching an all-time high of 30.98 CNH in September 2023, the stock plummeted to a low of 18.52 CNH on September 9th, 2024 - a whopping 42.6% decrease. However, the stock has since recovered slightly, with a gain of 2.4% over the past week. Key Metrics: P/E Ratio & P/B Ratio At a P/E ratio of 16.76, NHPM's valuation remains attractive compared to its industry peers. Additionally, the P/B ratio of 3.95 indicates that the stock is undervalued based on its book value. These metrics suggest that the stock could potentially see an uptick in the future, especially given its strong fundamentals. Technical Outlook: Mixed Signals From a technical standpoint, NHPM's chart paints a mixed picture. The stock has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, which can indicate either a bullish or bearish breakout. If the stock breaks above the upper trend line, it could signal a potential upswing towards 22.85 CNH, representing a 20% increase from its current price. Conversely, a break below the lower trend line could lead to a decline towards 16.37 CNH, a 12.5% decrease. Conclusion While NHPM's recent performance has been unpredictable, the stock's strong fundamentals and undervalued status make it an intriguing opportunity for long-term investors. However, short-term traders may want to exercise caution due to the mixed technical signals. As always, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Shanghai Foreign Service (600662.SS) traded up 3.87 % and now trades at CNH 3.99.

Title: Technical Analysis: China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Development Group Co Ltd (CSSP) In this article, we will provide a comprehensive technical analysis of China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Development Group Co Ltd (CSSP), based solely on the information available up until September 19th, 2024. CSSP has been relatively quiet in recent times, with no significant news or events impacting its performance. However, by examining its historical price data, we can identify some interesting trends and patterns that may be worth considering for investors. CSSP's stock has experienced a mixed bag of performances over the past year, with both highs and lows. Its 52-week high was reached on May 21st, 2024, at $9.32 CNH, while its 52-week low was hit on September 17th, 2024, at $6.29 CNH. As of today's closing price, CSSP is trading at $6.43 CNH, representing a decrease of approximately 31% from its peak and an increase of around 6% from its trough. Trend Lines: CSSP's price chart reveals several notable trend lines that could potentially influence future price movements. Firstly, there is a clear uptrend line that stretches back to early June 2024, indicating steady growth during that period. This uptrend line has been tested multiple times, but so far, it has held strong, suggesting that buyers remain interested in the stock despite recent declines. Another important trend line is the downtrend line that formed after CSSP's peak in late May 2024. This downtrend line has been persistent, with each attempt to break above it being met with selling pressure. However, the line has started to flatten out recently, which could signal a potential reversal in the near future. Support & Resistance: CSSP's support and resistance levels offer valuable insights into where the stock might find buyers and sellers. Based on its historical price action, the following levels have been identified: * Support: $6.29 CNH (52-week low), $6.43 CNH (current price), $6.67 CNH (200-day moving average) * Resistance: $7.00 CNH (20-day moving average), $7.33 CNH (50-day moving average), $8.00 CNH (200-day moving average) Technical Indicators: CSSP's technical indicators suggest a neutral stance for now, with neither bullish nor bearish signals dominating the landscape. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently sitting at 48.17, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a small positive divergence, hinting at possible upside momentum in the short term. Conclusion: While CSSP has faced some turbulence in recent months, its historical price data suggests that the stock remains attractive to long-term investors. The uptrend line and the flattening downtrend line indicate that buyers continue to show interest in the stock, even during periods of volatility. Additionally, the neutral stance of CSSP's technical indicators implies that any potential gains are likely to be gradual rather than explosive. Therefore, investors looking for a stable yet potentially rewarding investment opportunity may want to consider adding CSSP to their watchlists.\n\n- Chongqing Genrix Biopharmaceutical (688443.SS) traded down -2.42 % and now trades at CNY 22.26.

The median\nforecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey was a 0.4 per cent gain.\n\nThe inflation rate dropped from 0.7 per cent in February, when it had climbed\nabove zero for the first time in six months during the Chinese New Year\nholiday.\n\nProducer prices fell for an 18th straight month.\n\nThe price slowdown suggests China may not get much help from local shoppers to\nmeet growth targets that increasingly rely on selling its manufactured goods\nabroad. In addition, with US inflation moving in the opposite direction, there\nis a risk of an enduring interest-rate gap between the world's two biggest\neconomies that could add downward pressure on the renminbi.\n\n\"The price data clearly mirrors the weak domestic demand,\" said Mr Raymond\nYeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia & New Zealand\nBanking Group.\n\n\"The recent improvement in momentum is primarily export- driven.\"\n\nBefore China's CPI numbers came out, the central bank signalled continued\nsupport for the currency, after the offshore yuan weakened by the most in\nthree weeks overnight on the US inflation surprise. It set its daily reference\nrate at 7.0968 per US dollar, exceeding forecasts by the most on record.\n\nHigher inflation during the February holiday season, along with a tourism\nrevival, had raised hope that Chinese households might be rediscovering their\nappetite to spend. Absent that, the country's ability to hit its economic\ngrowth target of around 5 per cent in 2024 depends on overseas demand.\n\nBuoyant exports and factory activity data in recent weeks encouraged Goldman\nSachs and Morgan Stanley to raise their growth forecasts this week.\n\nThe slowdown in consumer inflation was due to \"waning consumption demand in\nMarch seasonally after the holiday while market supply was generally\nsufficient\", said NBS analyst Dong Lijuan in a statement accompanying the\nrelease of the figures.\n\nWith the housing market slump showing no signs of a turnaround, subdued demand\nfor building materials like steel is dragging producer prices down. The\noverall index declined 2.8 per cent, extending the longest falling streak\nsince 2016.\n\nFading inflation may still ramp up pressure on China's government to offer\nmore support for the economy. Falling prices squeeze companies' profit\nmargins, discouraging them from investment, and there is a risk consumers\ncould become even more reluctant to spend in anticipation that goods will be\ncheaper in the future.\n\nBut Mr Bruce Pang, chief economist for Greater China at Jones Lang LaSalle,\npointed to a constraint for Chinese central bankers: higher-than-expected US\ninflation could delay easing by the Federal Reserve. That would make it harder\nfor China to trim its own rates -- even though it needs to -- due to concern\nabout further weakening of the yuan, he said.\n\nIn a sign that deflation could continue to haunt the economy in the coming\nmonths, price competition in some industries has intensified lately.\n\nCompanies that produce materials for construction, like zinc smelters, have\nbeen forced to lower their charges because of excess capacity, while electric\ncar producers are offering aggressive discounts to lure customers.\n\nCore inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, slowed to\n0.6 per cent in March from 1.2 per cent in February, according to the NBS.\nBLOOMBERG"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

Rupee opened on a flat note and rose just 2 paise from its all-time low level to 84.58 against the US dollar in morning trade on Monday, on disappointing macroeconomic data and a negative trend in domestic equities.\n\nForex traders said Asian currencies like CNH, KRW and IDR were down after Trump Rhetoric on BRICs currency. Besides, the broad strength of the American currency and unabated foreign portfolio outflows further dented investor sentiments.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Saturday threatened a 100 per cent tariff on the BRIC bloc of nations if they act to undermine the US dollar.\n\nAt the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 84.59 and moved in a tight range and touched 84.58 against the greenback, registering a gain of just 2 paise over its previous close.

The 30-share benchmark index Sensex was trading 343.00 points, or 0.43 per cent lower, to 79,459.79 points. The Nifty fell 106.65 points, or 0.44 per cent, to 24,024.45 points.\n\nMeanwhile, the central government's fiscal deficit at the end of the first seven months of the current financial year touched 46.5 per cent of the full-year target. The deficit stood at 45 per cent of the budget estimates in the corresponding period of 2023-24.\n\nTraders said the persistent selling pressure by foreign funds added further strain on the currency.

The offshore yuan's USDCNH pair sank 0.2%, reflecting persistent selling biases towards the yuan.\n\nWhile monetary stimulus measures are expected to help support the Chinese economy, they herald more weakness for the yuan in the coming months.\n\nDollar at over 5-mth high as rate cut bets wane, Powell awaited\n\nThe dollar index and dollar index futures rose 0.1% each in Asian trade, hitting their highest levels since early-November.

Safe haven demand also saw traders largely favor the dollar.\n\nThe Australian dollar- usually seen as a key indicator of risk appetite, retreated on Tuesday, with the AUDUSD pair falling 0.4% to a five-month low.\n\nThe South Korean's USDKRW pair rose 0.9% to a 17-month high, while the Singapore dollar's USDSGD pair rose 0.3%.\n\nThe Indian rupee's USDINR pair was close to record highs, trading well above the 83.5 level.\n\nJapanese yen on intervention watch as USDJPY hits 34-yr high\n\nThe Japanese yen weakened further this week, with the USDJPY pair rising to a new 34-year high above 154.\n\nRecent weakness in the yen came even as several Japanese government officials warned against excessive forex speculation- a trend that is expected to spur intervention in currency markets.\n\nThis kept traders on guard for any potential intervention by the Japanese government, which usually entails selling high amounts of dollars to bring down the USDJPY pair.\n\n?

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "April 17 (Reuters) - Price action in FX derivatives is consistent with a\ngrowing risk of increased volatility and deeper EUR/USD declines, but low cost\noptions are still available for holders to participate should the situation\narise. \n    Implied volatility is a realised volatility gauge and key component of an\noption premium, so it's no surprise to see it surge to new long-term highs, with\nan additional premium for EUR/USD downside strikes. However, these higher\npremiums can be advantageous for more exotic type options.  \n    A regular vanilla call option with a strike at 1.0600 and expiry in 1-month\nwould cost 60 USD pips, or 33 USD pips with the strike at 1.05 and 17 USD pips\nwith the strike at 1.0400 (break-even is the strike minus the premium). However,\nthe additional implied volatility premium for downside strikes will cheapen\noptions with a knock-out trigger below the strike as that trigger is deemed more\nlikely to be touched and kill the option.  \n    For example, a 1-month expiry 1.0600 USD call with a knock out trigger at\n1.0300 is half the price of its vanilla equivalent, albeit dead if 1.0300\ntrades. Longer expiries and triggers closer to strike/current spot will be even\ncheaper.   \n    Alternatively, vanilla EUR put/USD call spreads allow holders to sell\nEUR/USD at one strike providing they buy at another below it. They are similar\nto KO-trigger options in that they are cheaper and profit potential is limited\nto the lower strike, but remain in play until expiry.\n   \n          \n    For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n1-3-month expiry EUR/USD risk reversals    https://tmsnrt.rs/3Q4oF6q\n1-month EUR/USD FXO implied vs 1-month daily realised volatility    https://tmsnrt.rs/3xB3Ysp\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion trades 3.99 percent higher on Wednesday 25th of SeptemberSep 25, 2024\n\nZhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion (603583.SS) traded up 3.99 % during a 24 hours period ending at 07:28 AM Central Europe on Wednesday 25th. One Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion stock can currently be bought for about CNY 16.13 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion stocks is 369 mn. Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion has a current market capitalization of CNY 5.9 bn and approximately CNY 110.3 mn worth of Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion has traded -0.5 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 18.45. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 22.93 on 05/09/2024. 52 weeks low was at CNY 12.87 on 02/06/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion\n\nTitle: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Embedway Shanghai (603496.SS) traded down -0.05 % and now trades at CNY 22.23.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Preparing for US inflation aftershockOn February 14, the US experienced an unexpected inflation shock, causing a surge in bond yields, pushing expectations of the first Fed rate cut out to June, and boosting the dollar. The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index is down four days in a row, with the MSCI World index slumping 1.4% for its steepest decline since September. The big three U.S. indices lost between 1.3% and 1.8%. \n\n The regional calendar on Wednesday is light, with wholesale price inflation in India and presidential elections in Indonesia being the main events. Chinese markets are still closed for Lunar New Year, although the offshore yuan could sell off. This presents a potentially choppy mix of political risk, below-average liquidity, and widespread 'risk off' sentiment across Asia following the tightening of financial conditions and big moves across many markets on Tuesday. \n\n U.S. Treasury yields jumped as much as 20 basis points after figures showed that annual U.S. CPI inflation slowed to 3.1% in January and not the 2.9% economists had expected. Stocks tumbled. The reaction of Japanese stocks will be particularly interesting after the dollar smashed through the psychologically important 150.00 yen barrier to trade within sight of the all-time high of just under 152.00 yen reached in November last year and October 2022. \n\n The Nikkei played catch up on Tuesday, surging nearly 3% for its best day since November 2022. However, the weak yen might take a back seat to Tuesday's global equity selloff. India's wholesale price index rose 0.53% year-on-year in January, with strong gains in food prices offset by fuel deflation.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Haitong Securities is trading -2.72 percent lower with a volume of HKD 160.1 mn on Monday 18th of NovemberNov 18, 2024\n\nHaitong Securities (6837.HK) traded down -2.72 % during a 24 hours period ending at 01:37 PM Central Europe on Monday 18th. One Haitong Securities stock can currently be bought for about HKD 6.89 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Haitong Securities stocks is 21 bn. Haitong Securities has a current market capitalization of HKD 142.9 bn and approximately HKD 160.1 mn worth of Haitong Securities was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Haitong Securities has traded 3.03 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at HKD 4.11. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at HKD 8.9 on 10/10/2024. 52 weeks low was at HKD 3.37 on 07/10/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Haitong Securities\n\nHaitong Securities Co Ltd has been making waves in the financial industry with its recent merger and restructuring plans, approved by the Shanghai government. Despite this exciting development, the company's shares have remained relatively stable in recent times. According to aastocks.com, the last known news about Haitong Securities dates back to November 5th, when the company announced its plans to merge with Guotai Junan. As of today, the stock's last closing price stands at 7.15 HKD, just a hair below its 52-week high of 8.9 HKD, which was reached on October 9th. On the other hand, the stock has also experienced a significant low of 3.37 HKD on July 9th. From a technical standpoint, Haitong Securities appears to be trading within a well-established range, with strong support at around 7 HKD and resistance hovering around 8.5 HKD. This range has held steady over the past few months, indicating that investors are confident in the company's long-term prospects despite any short-term volatility. One interesting metric to consider is the company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which currently stands at -21.47. While this may seem like an anomaly at first glance, it's important to note that this figure is heavily influenced by the company's recent merger announcement, which has caused some fluctuation in its earnings projections. However, with the merger expected to provide synergies and cost savings, analysts remain optimistic about the company's future growth potential. Another key metric worth examining is the company's price-to-book (P/B) ratio, which stands at 0.88452. This indicates that investors are willing to pay approximately 88% more for each dollar of the company's book value. While this may seem expensive at first glance, it's important to remember that Haitong Securities is a leading player in China's securities industry, with a diverse range of offerings and a strong track record of profitability. Overall, while there may not be any immediate catalysts driving Haitong Securities' share price higher, the company's solid fundamentals and promising long-term outlook make it an attractive investment opportunity for patient investors.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Sany Heavy Industry (600031.SS) traded down -1.46 % and now trades at CNY 17.83.

Title: Sany Heavy Industry's Solid Semester Results Boost Investor Confidence In a recent announcement, Sany Heavy Industry Co Ltd (SANY) has showcased impressive semi-annual results, highlighting the company's resilience and strength in the face of market challenges. As of yesterday's closing bell, SANY's stock closed at 18.5 CNH, up from its 52-week low of 12.6 CNH recorded on December 10, 2023. This significant increase in share value reflects investors' renewed confidence in the company's long-term potential. A From a technical analysis standpoint, SANY's recent performance presents an interesting opportunity for traders and investors. The stock's 52-week high of 20.76 CNH, reached on October 7, 2024, suggests a strong upswing in momentum, with the current price hovering around 18.5 CNH. This gap between the two prices represents a potential buying opportunity for those looking to capitalize on SANY's growth potential. Moreover, SANY's Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio of 29.8 and Price to Book (P/B) ratio of 2.25 indicate a reasonably valued stock with ample room for future expansion. These ratios suggest that while the company's current success is reflected in its share price, there remains potential for further growth based on historical data and industry trends. In conclusion, Sany Heavy Industry's solid semi-annual results and promising technical indicators make it an attractive investment option for those seeking exposure to China's growing heavy industries sector. With a proven track record of resilience and a bright outlook, SANY may be poised to continue its upward trajectory in the months ahead.\n\n- Zhongji Innolight (300308.SZ) traded down -5.58 % and now trades at CNY 132. Zhongji Innolight has a market capitalisation of CNY 155.2 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Zhongji Innolight is 33.4. Title: Technical Analysis: Zhongji Innolight's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Zhongji Innolight Co Ltd (Zhongji) may be left scratching their heads with mixed signals from the company's latest financial data. Despite a lack of recent news, we can analyze the company's historical pricing trends to identify potential opportunities or threats. Pricing Performance: A Tale of Two Halves Zhongji's stock has exhibited a peculiar pattern over the past year, with two distinct halves. From April to November 2023, the stock traded between 93.14 CNY (its 52-week low) and 156.3 CNY (its 52-week high), with a peak at 192.88 CNY on April 29th. This range represents a significant 108% increase in just six months. However, since then, the stock has experienced a sharp decline, falling by 26.5% to its current price of 118.44 CNY. This drastic change in fortunes raises several questions: Did investors overvalue the company during its growth phase? Have there been any changes in the company's fundamentals that could explain this sudden drop? To answer these questions, we must delve deeper into Zhongji's financials. Financials: A Puzzling Picture Zhongji's most recent financial report, dated August 6th, 2024, shows a net outflow of RMB523.6 million from northbound trading of SZ-HK Connect. While this might seem concerning, it is essential to note that this figure represents less than 1% of the company's total assets. Moreover, the company's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 37.13, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of Zhongji's earnings. However, the company's Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 8.89343 suggests that investors are valuing Zhongji's assets at a steep discount compared to its peers. This discrepancy could indicate that investors have concerns about the company's long-term growth prospects or are anticipating a correction in the market. Technical Indicators: Mixed Signals Abound When analyzing Zhongji's technical indicators, we find more conflicting signs. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that the stock is oversold, suggesting that it may be due for a rebound. On the other hand, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal points to a bearish crossover, implying a downward trend. Conclusion: A Complex Investment Decision In conclusion, Zhongji Innolight presents a complex investment decision, with both positive and negative signals. While the company's historical pricing trends suggest a potentially attractive entry point, its financials and technical indicators paint a more nuanced picture. Before making any investment decisions, it is crucial to carefully evaluate the company's fundamentals and consider multiple scenarios to mitigate potential risks.\n\n- China Land (1109.HK) traded down -1.66 % and now trades at HKD 23.85. Current market capitalisation for China Land is HKD 168.7 bn. China Land has a current price to earnings ratio of 5.61. Hong Kong-listed China Resources Land Limited (CR Land) has been making waves in the real estate market with its impressive performance despite facing challenges. According to the latest data available, CR Land's stock closed at HK$23.65 on October 6th, representing a significant increase from its 52-week low of HK$18.56 on September 15th. This upward trend suggests that investors have regained confidence in the company's ability to overcome obstacles and deliver growth. Looking at the technical analysis, CR Land's price to earnings ratio stands at 5.61, indicating that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. Moreover, the price to book ratio of 0.660828 suggests that the company's assets are being undervalued by the market. These ratios indicate that there may be potential for further upside in the stock's value. Despite the positive outlook, it's worth noting that CR Land's 52-week high of HK$33.70 on May 16th has yet to be surpassed. However, with the recent uptick in performance, it's possible that the stock could reach new heights in the near future. Investors looking for a well-performing real estate player with strong fundamentals may want to keep an eye on CR Land.\n\n- China Minsheng Banking (1988.HK) traded up 0.34 % and now trades at HKD 3.07. China Minsheng Banking has a market capitalisation of HKD 168.2 bn. China Minsheng Banking has a current price to earnings ratio of 4.26. Title: China Minsheng Banking Corp. Ltd. (CMAKY): A Dividend-Paying Gem in the Making? Investors may be eyeing China Minsheng Banking Corp. Ltd. (CMAKY), as the company has recently announced a dividend payout of $0.13 per share, set to be distributed on December 17th. This move comes as no surprise, given the company's strong financial performance and commitment to rewarding shareholders. A Technical Analysis Perspective Looking at the charts, CMAKY has been trending upwards over the past year, with a 52-week high of 3.71 HKD reached on October 7th, 2024. The stock has since pulled back slightly, but remains well above its 52-week low of 2.43 HKD marked on January 22nd, 2024. This bullish trend suggests that investors have confidence in the company's long-term prospects and growth potential. Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) With a P/E ratio of 4.38, CMAKY is trading at a premium compared to its peers in the banking sector. However, this can be justified by the company's impressive earnings growth, which has outperformed the industry average. In fact, analysts expect China Minsheng Banking's earnings per share to increase by 15% in the next year, indicating a promising future ahead. Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) At a P/B ratio of 0.265707, CMAKY is undervalued based on its book value. This presents an attractive entry point for investors looking to capitalize on the company's strong fundamentals and growth potential. Conclusion China Minsheng Banking Corp. Ltd. (CMAKY) appears to be a compelling investment opportunity, with a strong track record of earnings growth and a commitment to rewarding shareholders through dividends. While the stock may be trading at a premium compared to its peers, its undervalued P/B ratio and impressive earnings growth justify the valuation. As such, savvy investors may want to consider adding CMAKY to their portfolios for long-term gains.\n\n- Huatai Securities (6886.HK) traded down -5 % and now trades at HKD 13.44. Current market capitalisation for Huatai Securities is HKD 166.6 bn. Huatai Securities has a current price to earnings ratio of 7.37. Title: Huatai Securities: A Steady Performer with Untapped Potential Investors looking for a steady performer with untapped potential may want to take a closer look at Huatai Securities Co., Ltd. (HUATAI), a leading financial services provider based in Hong Kong. Despite lacking recent news, the company's fundamentals tell an encouraging story. Strong Earnings Momentum HUATAI has demonstrated strong earnings momentum over the past year, with a 52-week high of 21.3 HKD on October 6th, 2024. Although the stock has pulled back slightly since then, it remains above its 52-week low of 7.79 HKD on July 8th, 2024. This suggests that investors have been rewarded for holding onto the stock during periods of volatility. Attractive Valuation At its current price of 15.22 HKD, HUATAI trades at an attractive valuation, with a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.31 and a Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 0.80066. These ratios indicate that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers, providing a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Supporting the UN's Biodiversity Target In addition to its financial performance, HUATAI has also made headlines for its commitment to supporting the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In particular, the company has co-launched China's first Open Ended Collective Investment Schemes (OECMs) fund to support the SDGs, specifically targeting the UN's 30x30 biodiversity goal. This initiative highlights HUATAI's dedication to sustainability and long-term thinking, which could benefit both the environment and shareholders. Technical Outlook From a technical standpoint, HUATAI's chart pattern suggests a consolidation phase after the recent pullback. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 53.86, indicating a neutral position, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal is negative but showing signs of flattening out. If the stock can break above its short-term resistance level of around 16 HKD, it could potentially retest its 52-week high of 21.3 HKD. Conclusion While there may be no recent news to drive Huatai Securities' stock price, the company's fundamental strength and commitment to sustainability make it an attractive investment opportunity. With a steady earnings trajectory, undervalued valuation, and positive technical indicators, HUATAI presents a compelling case for long-term investors seeking exposure to the financial services sector.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Haitong Securities\n\nHaitong Securities Co., Ltd. is a financial services company based in Shanghai, China.

I\nexpect fiscal policy will become more proactive next year as a\npillar for growth.\"\n    As of 0400 GMT, the onshore yuan <CNY=CFXS> was 0.09% higher\nat 7.1730 to the dollar, reversing earlier loss by hitting a\ntrough of 7.1950 per dollar, the weakest since Aug. 15.\n    Its offshore counterpart <CNH=D3> traded at 7.188 yuan per\ndollar around midday.\n    Trump has said he will impose tariffs of 60% or more on\ngoods from China to boost U.S. manufacturing and will cut taxes.\nBoth policies are seen as inflationary and likely to keep U.S.\ninterest rates high and undermine currencies of trading\npartners.\n    During Trump's first presidency, the yuan weakened about 5%\nagainst the dollar during the initial round of U.S. tariffs on\nChinese goods in 2018, and fell another 1.5% a year later when\ntrade tensions escalated.\n    \"We don't think China policymakers would react to\ngeneralised pre-election candidate talk about tariffs before\nthey actually materialize,\" Citi analysts said in a note.\n    \"Under a potential 60% tariff, if the yuan exchange rate\nfollows the path in the last round, it could go to 7.7-8.0. The\nPeople's Bank of China (PBOC) may eventually allow the yuan\nexchange rate to adjust in this case, but still manage the\ntiming and the pace.\"\n    They also expect the central bank to defend the currency at\nan early juncture to anchor market expectations and show Beijing\nwill take active steps to manage bilateral trade imbalances. \n    China's major state-owned banks were selling dollars to\nprevent the yuan from weakening too fast on Wednesday and\nThursday, sources told Reuters.\n    Prior to the market opening, the PBOC set the midpoint rate\n<CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed to trade in a 2%\nband, at 7.1659 per dollar, its weakest since Nov. 17, 2023, and\n20 pips firmer than a Reuters' estimate <CNY=RTRS> of 7.1679.\n    \"Today's PBOC fixing doesn't suggest that authorities are\noverly concerned on FX yet given the historical fixings during\nbouts of USD strength,\" said Alex Loo, macro strategist at TD\nSecurities.\n    He referred to the central bank's persistently\nfirmer-than-expected midpoint seen late last year and early this\nyear to stabilise the yuan.\n    \"As the National People's Congress (NPC) is still ongoing,\nwe expect PBOC to cap any abrupt move higher in USD/CNY through\nstate banks' USD selling in the interim,\" Loo added.\n    Sources told Reuters last week that Beijing may announce a\nstronger fiscal package if Trump wins a second presidency as his\nreturn to the White House is expected intensify the economic\nheadwinds for China.\n    \n    LEVELS AT 0400 GMT\n INSTRUMENT   CURRENT    UP/DOWN(-)    % CHANGE    DAY'S HIGH  DAY'S \n              vs USD     VS.

The yuan was at 7.2251\nby midday, 257 pips softer than the previous late session close.\n    The sources declined to be identified because they are not\nauthorised to speak publicly about market trades.\n    The yuan has fallen more than 2% in three months, and has\nbeen pressured by growing market expectations of further\nmonetary easing to prop up the world's second-largest economy as\nwell as a weaker Japanese yen <JPY=>.  \n    Carlos Casanova, senior economist for Asia at UBP, said the\nstrengthening dollar and sharp depreciation in the yen and some\nAsian currencies after the Bank of Japan ended its negative\ninterest rate policy, have weighed on the yuan. \n    \"The market seems to have interpreted Asian currencies\nshould depreciate further against the U.S. dollar until the\nD-day of interest rate cuts by the Fed,\" he said.    \n    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China\n(PBOC) set the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan\nis allowed to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1004 per dollar, 62 pips\nweaker than the previous fix of 7.0942. \n    The Chinese central bank has for months been setting the\nrate at levels firmer than market projections, traders said. \n    Friday's midpoint was 1,143 pips firmer than a Reuters\nestimate of 7.2147, the biggest discrepancy since November.    \n    The offshore yuan <CNH=D3> meanwhile continued to weaken to\nhit a more than four-month low of 7.2525.   \n     Traders attributed sudden weakness in the yuan to rising\nmonetary easing expectations after senior PBOC officials hinted\nat there being further room to reduce bank reserve requirements.\n    China has room to further cut banks' reserve requirement\nratio (RRR), among other policy tools at its disposal, a deputy\ncentral bank head said on Thursday, underlining market\nexpectations for more easing measures to bolster the economy.\n    Ju Wang, head of Greater China FX and rates strategy at BNP\nParibas, expects the central bank's message on further monetary\neasing will cause the yuan to test lows around 7.3 again.\n    The yuan's sudden weakness weighed on stock markets too,\nwith the benchmark Shanghai stock index <.SSEC> down 1.4%.    \n    If there are signs China is allowing the yuan to depreciate\nfrom 7.2 to 7.3, \"it would definitely make it more difficult for\nthis equity rally to continue, because a lot of people would try\nto diversify into U.S. dollar exposure,\" Casanova said.\n\n (Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom and Summer Zhen; Editing by\nJacqueline Wong)\n ((summer.zhen@thomsonreuters.com; 852-3462-7739))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

Despite a lack of recent news, the company's fundamentals suggest that it could be a promising investment opportunity. According to data from Rohstoffecheck.de, GFL's last known closing price was 31.6 CNY on October 2nd, representing a significant increase from its 52-week low of 24.9 CNY on September 9th. This upward trend suggests that the company may be gaining momentum, which could bode well for future growth. Furthermore, GFL's price to earnings ratio stands at -38.03, indicating that the stock may be undervalued compared to its peers. Additionally, the price to book ratio of 1.47249 suggests that the company's assets are being underutilized, providing room for growth. While there have been no recent news updates on GFL, the company's strong financials and upward trend make it an attractive investment option for those looking to capitalize on the growing demand for lithium. With its 52-week high reaching 47.58 CNY on October 15th of last year, investors may want to keep a close eye on this stock as it continues to climb.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Goertek (002241.SZ) traded up 2.49 % and now trades at CNY 22.54. Goertek has a market capitalisation of CNY 76.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Goertek is 40.07. Title: Goertek's Plans for Expansion in Vietnam Remain Unchanged Despite Recent Market Fluctuations In an effort to diversify their production portfolio and cater to the growing demand for their products, Goertek, a leading manufacturer of audio components and smart accessories, has been eyeing a new factory in Vietnam. This move comes amidst the company's continued success in the market, with its stock prices experiencing fluctuations in response to changing market conditions. According to sources familiar with the matter, Goertek has been exploring the possibility of setting up a new factory in Vietnam to produce AirPods and other Apple-branded products. While the plans were first announced back in January, there have been no significant updates since then. However, industry experts believe that the company's expansion strategy remains unchanged, despite recent market volatility. From a technical standpoint, Goertek's stock performance has been somewhat erratic over the past few months. After reaching a 52-week high of 24.94 CNH on October 7th, the stock experienced a sharp decline, falling to a low of 13.83 CNH on February 4th. However, the stock has since recovered some ground, trading at around 22.13 CNH as of this writing. One possible reason behind the stock's fluctuations could be the ongoing global chip shortage, which has affected several industries, including technology and automotive. As a result, Goertek may have faced supply chain disruptions or increased costs, impacting its profitability and financial performance. Despite these challenges, analysts remain bullish on Goertek's long-term prospects, citing the company's strong track record of innovation and its strategic partnerships with major tech players like Apple. With a P/E ratio of 40.59 and a P/B ratio of 2.49, the stock appears to be undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. In conclusion, while Goertek's stock prices may experience short-term fluctuations due to external factors, the company's expansion plans in Vietnam remain unaffected. Investors looking for exposure to the rapidly growing technology sector may find Goertek an attractive investment opportunity, given its solid fundamentals and promising growth prospects.\n\n- Dawning Information Industry (603019.SS) traded up 1.94 % and now trades at CNY 52.93. Current market capitalisation for Dawning Information Industry is CNY 75.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Dawning Information Industry is 40.88.\n\n- Tsingtao Brewery (0168.HK) traded down -1.25 % and now trades at HKD 56.25. Tsingtao Brewery has a market capitalisation of HKD 81 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Tsingtao Brewery is 16.35. Tsingtao Brewery Co Ltd (OTCMKTS:TSGTF) has been experiencing a significant increase in short interest, according to the latest data available. As of September 28th, the short interest in the company had risen by 32.2%, indicating that investors may be betting against the stock's performance. Despite this increase in short interest, Tsingtao Brewery's stock has remained relatively stable over the past year, with its 52-week high reaching $67 HKD on October 6th and its 52-week low sitting at $40 HKD on September 18th. Currently, the stock is trading at around $59.8 HKD, representing a modest gain of 2.4% over the past month. From a technical standpoint, Tsingtao Brewery's price to earnings ratio of 21.4 and price to book ratio of 3.31464 suggest that the stock may be slightly overvalued compared to its peers in the consumer goods sector. However, the company's strong financial fundamentals, including its healthy balance sheet and consistent profitability, could support further growth in the long term. Investors looking to capitalize on Tsingtao Brewery's potential may want to consider waiting for a pullback towards the $50-$55 HKD range, which represents a key level of support based on the stock's historical performance. A break below this level could signal a more significant correction, but for now, the trend appears to be firmly in the bullish camp.\n\n- Montage (688008.SS) traded up 2.15 % and now trades at CNY 67.7.

Despite a lack of recent news, the company's financial performance and technical indicators paint a promising picture for those considering investment opportunities. According to data from Finanzen.net, Montage closed at 65.52 CNY on August 27th, representing a significant increase from its 52-week low of 42.2 CNY on April 9th. This upward trend suggests that the company has been gaining momentum over the past few months, indicating a positive outlook for future growth. Furthermore, Montage's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) stands at an impressive 57.7, suggesting that the market has priced in expectations of continued profitability. Additionally, the company's price-to-book ratio (P/B) of 7.52481 indicates that Montage's shares are undervalued compared to its peers, presenting a potential buying opportunity for savvy investors. While there have been no recent news updates on Montage, the company's historical performance and technical indicators suggest that it could be a valuable addition to any portfolio. With a strong track record of growth and a favorable valuation, Montage Technology Co Ltd appears poised for long-term success.\n\n- Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Union (600010.SS) traded up 1.21 % and now trades at CNY 1.65.

Current market capitalisation for Shaanxi Heimao Coking is CNY 5.9 bn.\n\n- Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion (603583.SS) traded up 3.99 % and now trades at CNY 16.02. Current market capitalisation for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is CNY 5.9 bn. Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion has a current price to earnings ratio of 18.89. Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Fujian Apex Software (603383.SS) traded up 10 % and now trades at CNY 29.41.

Title: Fujian Apex Software's Strong Fundamentals Drive Growth Potential Investors looking for a promising investment opportunity may want to consider Fujian Apex Software Co Ltd (FAS), a software development company based in China. Despite the lack of recent news, the company's strong fundamentals suggest that it could be poised for growth in the long term. According to data from Finanzen.net, the last known news about FAS dates back to August 29th, when the company presented its quarterly results. As of September 11th, the stock has maintained a steady closing price of 25.51 CNH, with a 52-week high of 55 CNH reached on September 26th, 2023, and a 52-week low of 23.25 CNH recorded on August 28th, 2024. These figures indicate a relatively stable performance over the past year, with a slight upward trend. One key metric that stands out for FAS is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 24.49, which suggests that the market is undervaluing the company's earning potential. This is supported by the company's strong financial health, with a Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 4, indicating that the company's assets are worth significantly more than its current market value. While there have been no recent developments or announcements regarding FAS, the company's solid track record and strong financials make it an attractive investment option for those seeking long-term growth. With a history of stability and a promising future ahead, FAS could be a valuable addition to any portfolio.\n\n- Zhejiang Lante Optics (688127.SS) traded up 6.07 % and now trades at CNY 15.44.

However, Chinese concept stocks continued to\nfall\n\novernight, including Tencent (00700), which had mixed quarterly results. The\nHang Seng\n\nIndex maintained trading during the first severe weather. The day opened lower\nby 197\n\npoints or 1%. However, driven by the rise of Tencent during the session, the\nHang Seng\n\nIndex once rose by up to 36 points to 19,859 points. However, the 50-day\nmoving average\n\n(approximately 19,809 points) clearly saw resistance and HSI soon returned to\ndecline.\n\nMainland properties rose first and then retreated. Gambling stocks and Chinese\nconcept\n\nstocks fell significantly, dragging the Hang Seng Index down 173 points or\n0.9% in half a\n\nday to 19,649.\n\nTrading was still smooth despite the bad weather, but the main board turnover\nshrank to\n\nnearly HKD 81.5 billion, a day-to-day drop of more than 20%.\n\nThe Hang Seng China Enterprises Index reported at 7,060, down 69 points or 1%.\nThe Hang\n\nSeng Tech Index reported at 4,392, down 63 points or 1.4%.\n\n\"The next wave of central government bailout will wait until Trump takes\noffice\"\n\nThe Hang Seng Index had fallen for four consecutive days, falling by more than\n1,100\n\npoints. Today, the Hang Seng Index opened nearly 200 points lower. Cheung Chi\nWai, a joint\n\nmanaging director at Prudential Brokerage Ltd, told ET Net News Agency that\nthe recent\n\nweak trend of the Hang Seng Index is mainly affected by negative factors such\nas the\n\ncontinued decline of the offshore RMB and the increasing tension in Sino-US\nrelations. He\n\npointed out that from signals such as TSMC stopping selling 7nm chips to\nChina, it can be\n\nseen that Sino-US trade friction is expected to become more intense. Tencent\nopened lower\n\nin the morning market and then rebounded, rising 1.58% in half a day to HKD\n410.2, making\n\nit the best performing blue chip currently.\n\nUnder the influence of many negative factors, he believes that the Hang Seng\nIndex has\n\nnow fallen below the gap level on 26 September (approximately 19,954). It is\nexpected that\n\nthe Hang Seng Index will repeatedly fall downwards and may bottom out at the\n100-day\n\nmoving average (approximately 18,663). As for whether the Hang Seng Index has\na chance to\n\nrise again in the short term, he said that it depends on whether the central\ngovernment\n\nwill introduce bailout measures. Now the market is also waiting for the next\nstep of the\n\ncentral government. However, he believes that the measures may need to wait\nuntil Trump\n\ntaking office in 2025. It remains on hold now and has entered a period of\npolicy\n\nobservation.\n\nData released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday (13th)\nshowed that the\n\nU.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.6% year-on-year in October, 0.2\npercentage\n\npoints higher than the previous value, in line with market expectations and\nincreasing the\n\nmarket's confidence that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest\nrates. He said\n\nthat since CPI is in line with market expectations, it has less impact on the\nHang Seng\n\nIndex. Based on the CPI and inflation data, he expects the Federal Reserve to\nslow down\n\nthe pace of future interest rate cuts, and may not cut interest rates in\nDecember. The\n\ninterest rate cut in 2025 will need to wait until Trump officially takes\noffice.\n\n\"Tencent's games are not performing well, but there are short-term speculation\n\nopportunities\"\n\nTencent announced its third quarter results as of the end of September this\nyear, with\n\nnon-IFRS profits of RMB 59.813 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 33%\nand a\n\nquarter-to-quarter increase of 4%, far exceeding market expectations of RMB\n54.37 billion.\n\nHowever, the game business, which is the most concerned aspect of the market,\nfell short\n\nof market expectations. Revenue from value-added service business increased by\n9%\n\nyear-on-year to RMB 82.7 billion during the quarter. Earlier, many major\nbanks, including\n\nJPMorgan, Nomura, CICC, Citi, etc., expected this business grew by more than\n10% in the\n\nthird quarter.\n\nCheung Chi Wai believes that Tencent's performance is good. Although the game\nbusiness\n\ndoes not meet market expectations, Tencent's earnings per share still grow\nstrongly. He\n\ncontinued to point out that Tencent's stock price outperformed the same sector\nthis\n\nmorning, indicating that the market recognized Tencent's performance. As for\nthe game\n\nbusiness revenue not meeting expectations, he pointed out that it was mainly\naffected by\n\nthe downgrade of consumption in the general environment and the high\nunemployment rate\n\namong young people. The number of people willing to top-up and the amount of\ntop-up have\n\ndeclined.\n\nRegarding Tencent's short-term trend, he said that yesterday Tencent slightly\nfell below\n\nHKD 400 (about HKD 396), and today it fell first and then rebounded. From the\ntechnical\n\ntrend, it is expected that the 10-day moving average will break through the\n20-day moving\n\naverage at about HKD 418, forming a golden cross.

Friday's USD/CNY trading band ceiling, based on the 7.1004\nmidpoint, is 7.2424.\n    USD/CNY spiked as state banks seemingly stepped away from defending the\n7.2000 psychological barrier, which for months had been an unofficial 'line in\nthe sand' for FX authorities trying to deter yuan bears.\n    Traders were caught off-guard because the yuan fixing was relatively stable;\na smaller dampening of the USD/CNY benchmark would have presaged a looser grip\non the yuan.\n    As of now, it appears yuan volatility may be back, a boon for the market,\nbut the bane of the PBOC.\n    USD/CNY has since settled lower to 7.2242, as state banks reappeared to sell\nUSD, but the offshore-traded USD/CNH has cleared the 7.2500 psychological\nbarrier.

But Hong Kong's Hang Seng\n<.HSI> ended 0.75% in the red. The offshore yuan <CNH=> weakened\nslightly against a red-hot dollar.\n    Depending on who you talk to, you'll get a different readout\non Beijing's rescue plans. But what's not in doubt is that they\nare badly needed.\n    The latest economic news from China shows the country still\nflirting with outright price deflation through September, as\nheadline annual consumer prices fell below forecast to just 0.4%\nand annual factory gate price inflation continued to slump a\nwhopping 2.8% rate during the month.\n    What's more, China's exports missed too - growing at the\nslowest pace in five months in September and suggesting\nmanufacturers are no longer rushing out orders ahead of tariffs\nfrom trade partners. But at a paltry 0.3%, annual imports growth\nslowed too and were a third of expectations.\n    While some banks such as Goldman Sachs have nudged up next\nyear's real GDP forecasts due to the stimulus measures, the\nprice picture raises questions about nominal growth and still\nsuggests the government's 5% growth targets will be hard to hit.\n    And the geopolitics doesn't help much.

The weekly jobless claims data was skewed by Hurricane Helene. Next week's data will be affected by Hurricane Milton.\n    Moves were fairly muted across major currencies. The euro was flat at $1.10938 <EUR=EBS>, the pound was up 0.08% at $1.3071 <GBP=D3>, while the dollar was up 0.34% against the Japanese yen at 149.11 <JPY=EBS>. \nAs a result, the dollar index <=USD> was flat at 102.89, taking a breather after a recent steady climb that took it above 103 on Thursday, its highest since mid-August on the back of traders reducing bets on further jumbo interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve at its remaining meetings this year. \n    \"The market is satisfied because there's nothing there that really tells against the narrative that the Fed is cutting; the only debate is how fast they're going to cut,\" said Steven Englander, head of Global G10 FX Research at Standard Chartered in New York.\n    \"Overall, the data have been slightly encouraging to that narrative and none of the data have been discouraging to the narrative that the Fed is cutting rates.\"\n    Britain's economy grew in August after two consecutive months of stagnation, providing some relief to finance minister Rachel Reeves ahead of the new Labour government's first budget later this month.\n    However, in addition to being broadly steady on the dollar the pound was little changed on the euro at 83.67 pence to the common currency. <EURGBP=D3> \nTraders are also watching French politics, after the government on Thursday delivered its 2025 budget with plans for 60 billion euros ($65.5 billion) worth of spending cuts and tax hikes on the wealthy and big companies to tackle a soaring fiscal deficit. \n    The budget is unlikely to pass until December, as French Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his allies in President Emmanuel Macron's camp lack a majority by a sizeable margin and will have little choice but to accept numerous concessions. \nMarkets are also awaiting a news conference from China's finance ministry on fiscal policy on Saturday. The Chinese yuan <CNH=> strengthened 0.17% against the greenback to 7.071 per dollar.\nThe Australian dollar <AUD=D3> strengthened 0.04% versus the greenback to $0.6742, while the New Zealand dollar <NZD=D3> was at $0.61 after the central bank on Wednesday slashed rates by a half point and hinted at further cuts to come.\n    In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin <BTC=> gained 3.43% to $61,771.00. Ethereum <ETH=> rose 2.74% to $2,431.10.\n     \n     \n Currency bid                                               \n prices at 11                                              \n October​ 02:21                                            \n p.m. GMT                                                  \n Description         RIC  Las  U.S. Close   Pct   YT  Hig  Low\n                          t    Previous     Chan  D   h    Bid\n                               Session      ge    Pc  Bid  \n                                                  t        \n Dollar index        <=U  102  102.89       -0.0  1.  102  102\n                     SD>  .82               6%    43  .99  .76\n                                                  %        \n Euro/Dollar         <EU  1.0  1.0938       0.08  -0  $1.  $1.\n                     R=E  946               %     .8  095  092\n                     BS>                          3%  3    7\n Dollar/Yen          <JP  149  148.58       0.39  5.  149  148\n                     Y=D  .15               %     76  .25  .51\n                     3>                           %        \n Euro/Yen            <EU  1.0  162.48       0.49  4.  163  162\n                     RJP  946               %     91  .29  .32\n                     Y=>  ​                       %        \n Dollar/Swiss        <CH  0.8  0.8563       0.15  1.  0.8  0.8\n                     F=E  573               %     9%  585  56\n                     BS>                                   \n Sterling/Dollar     <GB  1.3  1.3061       0.11  2.  $1.  $1.\n                     P=D  075               %     75  308  304\n                     3>                           %   2    2​\n Dollar/Canadian     <CA  1.3  1.3742       0.02  3.  1.3  1.3\n                     D=D  743               %     69  785  726\n                     3>                           %        \n Aussie/Dollar       <AU  0.6  0.6742       0.11  -1  $0.  $0.\n                     D=D  749               %     %   675  672\n                     3>                                    6\n Euro/Swiss          <EU  0.9  0.9364       0.19  1.  0.9  0.9\n                     RCH  382               %     03  387  363\n                     F=>                          %        \n Euro/Sterling       <EU  0.8  0.8373       -0.0  -3  0.8  0.8\n                     RGB  371               2%    .4  383  365\n                     P=>                          5%       \n NZ Dollar/Dollar    <NZ  0.6  0.6095       0.12  -3  $0.  0.6\n                     D=D  102               %     .4  610  072\n                     3>                           3%  7    \n Dollar/Norway       <NO  10.  10.7222      -0.2  5.  10.  10.\n                     K=>  695               5%    53  763  695\n                          3​                      %   7    9\n Euro/Norway         <EU  11.  11.7412      -0.2  4.  11.  11.\n                     RNO  707               9%    31  772  705\n                     K=>  6                       %        5\n Dollar/Sweden       <SE  10.  10.3744      -0.1  2.  10.  10.\n                     K=>  359               4%    91  415  360\n                          8                       %   7    1\n Euro/Sweden         <EU  11.  11.3617      -0.1  1.  11.  11.\n                     RSE  340               9%    93  388  341\n                     K=>  4                       %   3    \n     \n     \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates    https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York and Alun John in London; Editiing by Kim Coghill, Andrew Heavens and Jonathan Oatis)\n((mailto:Chibuike.Oguh@thomsonreuters.com; +332-219-1834; Reuters Messaging: rm://chibuike.oguh.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net/))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

However, that's rarely the case and while\nthe disparity allows option markets to trade any offset between\nimplied and realised volatility, levels of implied volatility\ncan provide an FX bellwether for the broader FX market. \n    When implied volatility is low it highlights expectations of\nlow realised volatility, often within familiar ranges and\nagainst a backdrop of strong risk appetite.

Despite the lack of recent news, the company's fundamentals and technical indicators paint a picture of continued growth and potential gains.

Aluminum Of China has a market capitalisation of HKD 101.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Aluminum Of China is 6.91.\n\n- Advanced Micro-fabrication Equipment China (688012.SS) traded down -1.12 % and now trades at CNY 124.43. Current market capitalisation for Advanced Micro-fabrication Equipment China is CNY 91.8 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Advanced Micro-fabrication Equipment China is 52.18.\n\n- Anhui Conch Cement (600585.SS) traded up 0.75 % and now trades at HKD 17.5. Current market capitalisation for Anhui Conch Cement is HKD 102.8 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Anhui Conch Cement is 11.16. Title: Technical Analysis: Anhui Conch Cement's Shares Slip Below Key Level In our latest technical analysis, we take a closer look at Anhui Conch Cement Co Ltd (OTCMKTS:AHCHY), whose shares have recently passed below a key level. As of the last closing price of 20.08 HKD, the stock has dipped below its 50-day moving average of 11.88, indicating a potential downward trend. This development may be concerning for investors who have been following the company's progress over the past year. Looking back at the past 52 weeks, Anhui Conch Cement has experienced a range of highs and lows. The stock reached its peak of 27.08 HKD on September 19th, 2023, before falling to its lowest point of 19.61 HKD on September 10th, 2024. This volatility has resulted in a price to earnings ratio of 10.97 and a price to book ratio of 0.44279, which provides insight into the company's value relative to its earnings and assets. From a technical standpoint, the stock's recent dip below its 50-day moving average could signal a bearish trend. However, it's important to note that this movement may also present an opportunity for savvy investors looking to buy low and hold for the long term. Our analysis suggests that the stock's current price of 20.08 HKD is near the lower end of its 52-week range, making it potentially undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. Overall, our technical analysis indicates that Anhui Conch Cement's shares may be experiencing a temporary downturn, but the company's fundamentals remain strong. Investors considering a position in the stock should carefully evaluate their risk tolerance and time horizon before making a decision.\n\n- China Communications Construction (601800.SS) traded up 0.7 % and now trades at HKD 7.29. Current market capitalisation for China Communications Construction is HKD 101.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for China Communications Construction is 5.2. China Communications Construction Co Ltd (CCC) has been relatively quiet in recent months, with no significant news updates since March 27th, 2024. However, a look at the company's historical stock performance reveals some interesting trends. As of September 20th, 2024, CCC's closing price stood at HKD 7.18, down from its 52-week high of HKD 9.9 on April 15th, 2024. This represents a decline of approximately 28% from its peak. On the other hand, the stock has experienced a slight uptick in recent days, up from its 52-week low of HKD 6.81 on January 22nd, 2024. Despite this volatility, CCC's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio remains relatively modest at 5.2, suggesting that investors may be undervaluing the company's earning potential. Additionally, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio stands at 0.38133, indicating that the stock may be trading at a discount compared to its book value. Technical analysts note that CCC's stock has been trending downwards over the past few months, but has recently found support at around HKD 7.00. If the stock can break above this level, it could potentially signal a reversal in the downward trend and point towards a bullish outlook. Conversely, a failure to hold this support could lead to further declines. In conclusion, while there have been no recent news updates on CCC, a review of its historical stock performance suggests that the company may be undervalued by investors. Technical indicators suggest that the stock may be poised for a rebound, but any such move would require a break above the HKD 7.00 mark.\n\n- Aecc Aviation Power (600893.SS) traded up 0.41 % and now trades at CNH 33.95.

The euro <EUR=>, which is heading for a drop of nearly 5% against the dollar this year, was down 0.24% at $1.048825.\n    The U.S. dollar index <=USD> - which tracks the currency against six others - rose 0.17% to 106.97, after trading as high as 107.08 on\nthe session.\n    \"The market is trying to debate whether it's time to fade the dollar, which has had an incredible run this year,\" said Marvin Loh,\nsenior global market strategist at State Street in Boston. \n    \"But it seems hard to really push back against U.S. exceptionalism and a stronger dollar going into the new administration, whether\nwe're talking about a Fed that will probably not seem as dovish as it did in September or the challenges that keep popping up in the\nemerging and developed markets that make the dollar a safe haven.\"\n   The pound sterling rose against the dollar after data showed British wage growth picked up more strongly than expected in the three\nmonths to October. The Bank of England will announce its rate decision on Thursday.

This\ntime President Xi Jinping is better prepared for a fight, even as he has more\nto lose.\n\nTrump, who won a second term as president in an election on Tuesday, has\nthreatened to put tariffs of as much as 60% on Chinese goods, a level that\nBloomberg Economics says will decimate trade between the world's biggest\neconomies. That's on top of a range of export controls on advanced technology\nthat the Biden administration has only tightened since Trump left office.\n\nDuring this period, China has taken strategic steps to ensure it's more\nresilient and well-positioned to strike back. Key to that has been expanding\nits toolkit, which now includes export controls on critical raw materials,\ntariffs on agricultural goods and an entity list that can target key American\ncompanies.\n\n\"China, psychologically speaking, is much more prepared in dealing with him\nagain,\" said Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the People's Liberation Army\nand senior fellow at Tsinghua University's Centre for International Security\nand Strategy. China's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday congratulated Trump on his\nelection victory, saying it respects the choice of Americans.\n\nStill, Xi would much prefer to avoid a tariff battle that risks proving much\nmore devastating than the first round. China has relied on exports of goods\nlike electric vehicles and batteries to buoy an economy beset by deflationary\npressure and property woes, and Chinese lawmakers are meeting this week to\nformulate measures to bolster growth.\n\nIf Trump follows through on his tariff threats, Chinese authorities will need\nto do much more to help the economy. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said last week\nthat steeper trade restrictions on China may force Xi's hand to bolster\ndomestic consumption, something the Communist Party has traditionally sought\nto avoid.\n\nThe yuan on Wednesday weakened the most in two years and Chinese stocks fell,\ngiving investors a taste of the volatility that lies ahead as Trump clinches\nthe US presidency. The offshore yuan fell as much as 1.3% against the dollar,\nthe largest one-day drop since October 2022. Chinese shares listed in Hong\nKong bore the brunt of the selling, with a Hang Seng gauge closing 2.6% lower.\n\n\"China can hardly retaliate on 60% tariffs,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, Asia\nPacific chief economist at Natixis SA. \"What China will do is to announce a\nbigger stimulus to counteract so that the market doesn't penalize China.\"\n\nDuring Trump's first term, roughly two years of threats, tariffs and talks\nended with a deal signed in January 2020 that included a promise by China to\nbuy $200 billion worth of American goods to try and close its trade imbalance\nwith the US. However, the outbreak of Covid around the same time quickly\nsoured relations between the countries, and China never came close to\nachieving the targets as Chinese exports soared during the pandemic.\n\nA renewed trade war threatens to do greater damage to global trade. Last year,\nChinese companies exported $500 billion in goods to the US, or about 15% of\nthe value of all its exports. If the US were to put high tariffs on all or\nmuch of those products, it could wipe out those sales and further hurt firms\nfacing a weak domestic economy and falling prices.\n\nWhile Chinese officials don't want to overreact to Trump's new tariff threats,\nthey are also wary of looking weak, according to Scott Kennedy, a senior\nadviser at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International\nStudies, who frequently travels to China. Potential options for Xi's\ngovernment, he said, include targeting American companies with sizable\ninterests in China, selling US treasuries, devaluing the yuan and doing more\noutreach in Europe and Latin America.\n\n\"They're sick of being treated like a piñata and want to fight back,\" Kennedy\nsaid of China. \"They're prepared to deal with Trump and fight fire with fire\nif needed.\"\n\nOne wild card for China is the emergence of Elon Musk as a major supporter of\nTrump's campaign for president. The billionaire chief executive officer of\nTesla Inc. has extensive business interests in China, raising the possibility\nthat he could advocate a softer approach. Trump praised Musk while declaring\nvictory in the early morning hours of Wednesday in the US.\n\nBut if a trade war does erupt, China will be ready to hit back - and US\nexports of agricultural goods may again be the first target. Since Trump's\nfirst term, Brazil has strengthened its position as the largest soybean\nsupplier to China, and is now also the biggest source of corn imports,\nreplacing the big spike of US exports to China as part of the 2020 trade deal.\nIn 2016, the US supplied more than 40% of Chinese soybean imports, but that\nhad fallen to less than 18% in the first nine months of this year.\n\nChina's slowing economy also provides Beijing with more of a buffer, as its\ndemand for pork - as well as corn and soybeans to feed pigs - has slumped.\nThat means it's less reliant on imports and can more easily shift purchases\nfrom the US to other nations.\n\n\"There should not be any doubt about China's tit-for-tat retaliation,\" said\nZhou Xiaoming, a researcher at a Beijing think-tank and a former deputy\nrepresentative to China's United Nations mission in Geneva a decade ago. \"Easy\ntargets include corn and soya beans. The country is in a better position than\n2018 to take counter measures as China has developed Brazil as a reliable\nalternative source of supplies and been able to reduce imports from the US.\"\n\nAt the same time, however, China has fewer obvious targets to hit. The\ncountry's imports from the US have fallen from a peak in 2021, and Beijing\nhasn't signed a contract to buy new Boeing Co. jets for years, meaning it has\none less threat it can make. In addition to a weakening trade relationship,\ndirect investment ties between the US and China are also shrinking: The stock\nof Chinese investment in the US last year was down by 28% from the peak in\n2019, according to United Nations data.\n\nThat raises the possibility that China may seek to devalue its currency,\nmaking exports cheaper. While China's last formal devaluation was in 2015,\nduring the thick of the first trade spat from mid-2018 to mid-2019 authorities\nallowed the yuan to fall to almost 7.2 to the dollar, making its exports\ncheaper and providing some cushion to Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe Chinese currency is currently around the same level, but allowing it to\ndrop a lot further risks irking other trading partners around the world, who\nmight in turn put their own tariffs on Chinese goods. A flood of cheap steel\nhas already prompted nations to raise barriers to the metal, and that could\nspread to more products in a general trade war.\n\nOne major new tool for Xi is export controls, which the US has deployed\nfrequently against China. Last year, Beijing restricted overseas sales of\ngallium and germanium, two metals which are widely used across chipmaking,\ncommunications equipment and defense industries. China may now seek to impose\ncurbs on critical raw materials the US needs for strategic technologies, such\nas antimony, which is used in some semiconductor devices.\n\nChina also now has a more formal process for sanctioning foreign firms.\nAuthorities in September said China would begin a probe of PVH Corp., the\nparent company of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, for not using cotton from\nthe far west region of Xinjiang, where the US restricted trade due to human\nrights concerns. Beijing has also sanctioned a US drone firm for supplying\nTaiwan, blocking it from purchasing parts in China, according to the Financial\nTimes.\n\nUltimately, China would prefer to strike a deal with Trump. The incoming\npresident has signaled that he would be open to Chinese investment in the US,\nwhich could potentially form the basis for some sort of agreement, according\nto Henry Wang Huiyao, founder of the Center for China and Globalization\nresearch group in Beijing.\n\n\"Trump is a pragmatic politician who focuses on solving specific problems,\"\nWang said. \"China has the super lead on electric vehicles and green\ntechnology,\" he added. \"There's an enormous opportunity that Chinese companies\ncan help make America great again.\"\n\nStill, there's a recognition in Beijing that China must hope for the best and\nprepare for the worst. And there's not a whole lot of options if Trump wants\nto make good on extreme threats that would also hurt the US and raise prices\nfor American consumers.\n\n\"We've talked a lot about what China can do to prepare for this scenario, but\nin the end there isn't really too much that can be prepared,\" said Tu Xinquan,\na former adviser to China's Commerce Ministry who is now professor and dean of\nthe China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International\nBusiness and Economics in Beijing.\n\n\"There's no silver bullet,\" he added. \"We can only deal with the problem when\nit comes.\" Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.\nFor any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement,\nplease contact Editor at contentservices@htdigital.in"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

Although it has pulled back slightly since then, the uptrend remains intact, with the stock maintaining above its short-term moving averages.

Title: Technical Analysis: Shanghai Datun Energy's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into Shanghai Datun Energy Resources Co Ltd (SDE) may be scratching their heads after the latest quarterly numbers were released without any recent news updates. Despite this lack of fresh information, we can still analyze the company's performance based on its historical data to identify potential trends and patterns. Priced at 10.65 CNH as of yesterday's closing bell, SDE has been trading within a relatively narrow range over the past few months. However, there have been some notable milestones that could impact investment decisions. On February 22nd, the stock reached its 52-week high of 16.44 CNH before retreating to a 52-week low of 10.61 CNH just nine days later on September 10th. This volatility suggests that investors may want to exercise caution when considering a position in SDE. One positive aspect of SDE's performance is its strong Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 30.22, indicating that the company's shares are undervalued compared to its earnings. Additionally, the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 0.6059 suggests that the company's shares are reasonably priced relative to its assets. These ratios suggest that SDE may be an attractive investment opportunity for those willing to take on some risk. However, other technical indicators tell a different story. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 47.85, which indicates that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows that the stock is trading below its 26-day exponential moving average (EMA), which could indicate a downward trend. In conclusion, while Shanghai Datun Energy Resources Co Ltd has shown promise with its P/E and P/B ratios, other technical indicators suggest that the stock may be experiencing a downturn. Investors should carefully consider these factors before making any investment decisions regarding SDE.\n\n- Shanghai Smi (600649.SS) traded up 1.94 % and now trades at CNH 3.25.

Title: FESCO Group Co Ltd's Delayed Annual Report Raises Investor Concerns In a recent development, Future Energy Source Company Limited (FESCO), a leading player in the renewable energy sector, has faced yet another delay in releasing its annual report for the year ended March 31, 2024. This latest setback has raised concerns among investors who have been eagerly awaiting the report to gain insights into the company's financial performance and future prospects. According to sources, the delayed report is likely to be released by the end of September 2024, which marks a significant departure from the original deadline of August 30, 2024. While the reason behind this delay remains unclear, industry experts speculate that it may be due to internal issues or complexities related to the company's financial statements. Despite these challenges, FESCO's stock performance has remained relatively stable over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing price, the company's shares were trading at 13.72 Chinese Yuan (CNH), down from its 52-week high of 25.6 CNH recorded on September 25, 2023. However, the stock has seen a significant drop from its 52-week low of 13.22 CNH on August 26, 2024. From a technical perspective, FESCO's current price of 13.72 CNH represents a discount of approximately 45% compared to its 52-week high. This presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors looking to capitalize on the company's potential for growth in the renewable energy sector. Moreover, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.21 and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.27 indicate undervaluation, suggesting that the market may be overlooking the company's strengths and potential for future expansion. In conclusion, while the delayed release of FESCO's annual report may cause temporary uncertainty among investors, the company's fundamentals and long-term growth prospects remain intact. With a strong track record of innovation and a commitment to sustainability, FESCO is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for clean energy solutions. Therefore, savvy investors may view this recent pullback as a buying opportunity ahead of what could be a significant recovery in the company's share price.\n\n- Wuxi Huaguang Environment & Energy (600475.SS) traded down -1.69 % and now trades at CNH 8.3.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Market Takes JPY Lower Despite Intervention Speculation, While Sterling ShinesJul 12, 2024\n\nOverview:The dollar is mostly consolidating yesterday's CPI-inspired decline. The main features include the market bidding the US dollar back above JPY159 despite more speculation that the BOJ did in fact intervene yesterday and checked on the euro-yen cross in the local session today, and unexpectedly soft Swedish inflation, which the swaps market says could spur three rate cuts here in second half. A record trade surplus and strong aggregate lending figures did not prevent the offshore yuan paring yesterday's gains. Sterling is pushing to new highs for the year above $1.2950, while the euro holds in a narrow range below $1.0890. Most emerging market currencies are firmer, with the notable exception of Taiwan, South Korea, and Türkiye. \n\nThe rebound in the yen appeared to weigh on Japanese stocks, where the Nikkei tumbled nearly 2.5%, its largest loss in nearly three months. The biggest drop in the NASDAQ since late April took a toll on Taiwan and South Korean equities, where the main index fell nearly 2% and 1.2%, respectively. Mainland shares that trade in Hong Kong jumped 2.5% while the CSI 300 eked out a small gain. Less-tech-intensive, Europe's Stoxx 600 is up a little more than a quarter of a percent, for what could be the third consecutive advance, the longest in more than a month. US index futures are narrowly mixed, ahead of the US PPI. Asia Pacific bonds played catch up after strong US rally yesterday, while European yields are 3-5 bp higher, except in Sweden after its CPI report. UK Gilts have been hit the hardest and the 10-year yield is up a little more than seven basis points. The 10-year US Treasury yield fell seven basis points yesterday to about 4.21% and is now a little more than a single basis point higher. Gold surged through $2400 yesterday to almost $2425 is softer today and testing the $2400 area from above. September WTI is at a four-day high above $82. Monday's high was $82.50. \n\nAsia Pacific\n\nThe market is trying to figure out if the BOJ intervened after yesterday's soft US CPI.A Japanese TV claimed intervention took place, citing one unnamed person. A newspaper cited an unnamed government official, and earlier today, the press reported BOJ checked on the euro-yen cross. Still, we will not know for sure until the end of the month but there may be some indication by early next week. We think in both word and deed, Japan does not appear to be defending a level. Instead, broadly understood, there are three criteria:  one-way market, volatile market, or one that is not responding as it should to fundamental developments. None of those conditions existed yesterday, which would seem to make a high bar for Japan intervention during US hours. It might not be a decisive factor one way or the other. The dollar held yesterday's lows and recouped almost half of yesterday's decline. Of course, Beijing closely manages the yuan, but we see the PBOC have slowed the yuan's depreciation, which is the exact opposite it would do if it were using its foreign exchange policy to supplement it mercantilist practices. The yuan's surge yesterday by a little more than 0.25%, is its largest advance in two months. It was a function of 1), the dollar's broad weakness, 2) the yen's surge, and 3) the drop in US rates. Although we see China as an aggressor in its foreign policy, in the foreign exchange market is seems to be more passive and desires, like many other countries, especially in the area, to have a relatively stable exchange rate. Incidentally, until it no longer suited, high-income countries wanted stable exchange rates too--hence Bretton Woods. After it collapsed, European countries which trade so intensely, tried various schemes to keep their currencies stable against each other, until finally adopting a single currency. China reported a record trade surplus ($99 bln after $82.6 bln in May). Exports rose 8.6% year-over-year (up from 7.6%) and imports unexpectedly fell by 2.3% (from +1.8%). Separately, China reported a surge in aggregate lending last month (CNY18.1 trillion from CNY14.8 trillion), largely in line with expectations. \n\nAmid the uncertainty over the yen, what we do know is that the dollar was coming off from around JPY161.60 a few minutes before the US CPI and within a few minutes after the report was a big figure lower.A short-lived attempt to buy the dollar faltered near JPY161, which was not to be seen again. Within about a half an hour, it had dropped to about JPY157.45 the session low. Hence, the speculation of intervention speculation. The greenback calmed down before Europe closed yesterday in about a third of a yean range above JPY158.50. Today's session high was set early Japanese trading near JPY159.45. It was sold to JPY157.75 before returning to JPY159, and traded around there in the European morning.After holding support near $0.6750, the Australian dollar jumped to almost $0.6800 after the US CPI.After a few tries in vain, the Aussie surrendered its gains and returned to status quo ante. It is trading with a firmer bias today but in a little more than a quarter of a cent below $0.6780.The soft US CPI, broad dollar sell-off, especially against the yen, and drop in US rates did more to helped Chinese officials steady the yuan.The yuan, both onshore and off, reached the best level in nearly a month. The offshore yuan has risen in five of the past seven sessions coming into today, but yesterday's 0.33% advance was more than the other four advancing sessions combined. The five-day moving average has crossed below the 20-day moving average for the first time since in a month and a half. This may have matched or confirmed a signal for short covering. The PBOC reduced the dollar's reference rate for second consecutive session to CNY7.1315 from CNY7.1329 yesterday and CNY7.1342 on Wednesday. Against the offshore yuan, the dollar is holding above CNH7.26 today after falling to CNH7.2580 yesterday. It has held below CNH7.28. \n\nEurope\n\nNorway reported softer than expected CPI earlier this week and the krone fell 1.2% against the dollar in response.Sweden reported a sharp decline in its June CPI today. The krona had strengthened in the past three sessions coming into today, including yesterday's surge (~0.9%), the largest gain in a month, before consolidating today. Headline CPI slowed to 2.6% from 3.7%, while the underlying rate, which it targets (uses a fixed interest rate) fell to 1.3% from 2.3%. A Swedish rate cut at it August 20 meeting is fully discounted, as is at least one more this year. In fact, the swaps market has about an 90% chance of three cuts before the end of the year. The Swedish krona is the weakest of the G10 currencies today, off nearly 0.5% against the dollar. Meanwhile, the political uncertainty in France and its fiscal challenges did not prevent the euro from trading at its best level in a month yesterday. It underscores our belief that the key driver is on the US side of the equation. The French 10-year premium over Germany is essentially flat on the week near 65 bp. \n\nThe euro rallied a half of a cent to $1.09 on the US CPI, breaking out of the short-term flag pattern higher.It stalled as it approached the upper end of where it has been since the spring equinox. It pulled back to around $1.0860 as it appeared late longs and momentum traders were forced to the sidelines. The euro remains firm in a roughly $1.0860-$1.0890 range today. The US two-year premium over Germany continues to hover around 170 bp. We anticipate a consolidative phase or the euro in the coming days.Sterling rose to almost $1.2950 yesterday, its best level since last July.That was three-standard deviations above the 20-day moving average (Bollinger Band is two standard deviations). After the initial surge, sterling gains were gently pared until new buyers emerged $1.2900. It has held $1.29 today and pushing above $1.2950 in the European morning. The upper Bollinger Band is near $1.2915 today. Sterling has had quite an impressive run, falling in only three sessions in the past three weeks. Last year, sterling peaked in the middle of July near $1.3140. \n\nAmerica\n\nThere can be little doubt that the soft June CPI will boost the Fed's confidence that inflation is moving toward its target.Headline CPI rose at an annualized pace of 0.8% in Q2 24, down from 4.4% in Q1. In H1, the annualized pace rate was 2.6%. In H2 23, it was 3.2%. The core rate rose at an annualized rate of 2.4%, half of the Q1 pace. Though the echo of Q1's disappointing performance linkers as core CPI rose at an annualized clip of 3.6% in H1 24, up from 3.0% in H2 23. There is still little chance of a cut at this month's FOMC meeting, but the derivatives market shows full confidence of a cut in September and another one before the end of the year. There seems to an increase in bank's anticipating cuts at each of the last three meetings of the year. The Fed funds futures are pricing in around a 40% chance of that third cut. Today's PPI report will help economists finalize forecasts for the PCE deflator, but the die has been cast. Barring a shock, the headline and core PCE deflators are likely to soften by about 0.1% (2.4% and 2.5%, respectively). \n\nThe US dollar recorded an outside day against the Canadian dollar, trading on both sides of Wednesday's range yesterday.Even though the close was inside that range, the price action disappointed those looking for a breakout when the greenback was sold through CAD1.3600. The Canadian dollar was one of two G10 currencies that could not find traction against the US dollar (the other being the Norwegian krone). Even the false break of CAD1.3600 reinforced the significance of its support. The CAD1.3650 area has capped the upside since last Thursday. It is consolidating in a narrow range today between about CAD1.3610 and CAD1.3635.Meanwhile, the greenback recorded the seventh consecutive session of lower highs and lower lows against the Mexican peso.It fell to almost MXN17.7025 yesterday, down from MXN18.1060 at the end of last week. The dollar frayed the lower Bollinger Band (~MXN17.76) for the second session. It is found near MXN17.70 today. While the Mexican peso remained firm, the three poorest performing emerging market currencies were the Brazilian real (~-0.40%), Chilean peso (~-0.33%), and the Colombian peso (~-0.20%), each apparently with idiosyncratic drivers. \n\nDisclaimer \n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

The State Council\nInformation Office, which handles media queries for the\ngovernment, did not also immediately respond to a request for\ncomment. \n    \n    \n    Allowing the yuan to depreciate next year would deviate from\nthe usual practice of keeping the foreign exchange rate stable,\nthe sources said.\n    The tightly managed yuan is allowed to move 2% on either\nside of a daily mid-point fixed by the central bank. Policy\ncomments from top officials typically include commitments to\nkeeping the yuan stable.\n    While the central bank is unlikely to say it will no longer\nuphold the currency, it will emphasize allowing the markets more\npower in deciding the yuan's value, one source with knowledge of\nthe matter said. \n    At a meeting this week of the Politburo, a decision-making\nbody of Communist Party officials, China pledged to adopt an\n\"appropriately loose\" monetary policy next year, marking the\nfirst such easing of its policy stance in some 14 years.\n    The comments did not include a reference to the need for a\n\"basically stable yuan\", which was last mentioned in July but\nmissing in the September readout, too.\n    Yuan policy has figured heavily in financial analysts' notes\nand other think-tank discussions this year. \n    In a paper published by leading thinktank China Finance 40\nForum last week, analysts suggested China should temporarily\nswitch from anchoring the yuan to the U.S dollar to linking it\ninstead to a basket of non-dollar currencies, particularly the\neuro, to ensure the exchange rate is flexible during a period of\ntrade tensions. \n    A second source privy to the central bank's thinking told\nReuters the PBOC has considered the possibility the yuan could\ndrop to 7.5-per-dollar to counteract any trade shocks. \n    That's a roughly 3.5% depreciation from current levels\naround 7.25.\n    During Trump's first term as president, the yuan weakened\nmore than 12% against the dollar during a series of tit-for-tat\ntariff announcements between March 2018 and May 2020.\n    \n    DIFFICULT CHOICE\n    A weaker yuan could help the world’s second-biggest economy\nas it seeks to reach what is expected to be a challenging 5%\neconomic growth target and relieve deflationary pressures by\nboosting export earnings and making imported goods more\nexpensive.\n    A sharp downturn in exports would give further cause for\nauthorities to try and use the currency to protect the one\nsector of the economy that has been doing well.\n    China's exports slowed sharply and imports unexpectedly\nshrank in November, spurring calls for more policy support to\nprop up domestic demand.\n    \"To be fair, it is a policy option. Currency adjustments are\non the table as a tool to be used to mitigate the effects of\ntariffs,\" said HSBC's chief Asia economist Fred Neumann.\n    But that would be a short-sighted policy choice, he said.\n    \"If China takes the currency aggressively lower, it raises\nthe risk of a tariff cascade and other nations then essentially\nsay, well, if the Chinese currency is weakening dramatically,\nthen we may not have a choice to impose import restrictions on\ngoods from China ourselves,\" Neumann said.\n    \"So there is a bit of a risk here that if China uses its\ncurrency angle too aggressively, it could lead to a backlash\namong other trading partners and that's not in the interest of\nChina.\"              \n     Analysts' average forecast is for the yuan to fall to 7.37\nper dollar by the end of next year, though a key factor will be\nhow much Trump raises tariffs and how quickly.\n        The currency has lost nearly 4% of its value against the\ndollar since the end of September as investors positioned for a\nTrump presidency. \n    The central bank has in the past contained volatility and\ndisorderly moves in the yuan through its daily guidance rate to\nmarkets and through state banks’ buying and selling of the\ncurrency.    \n     The yuan, or renminbi (RMB) as it is sometimes known, has\nstruggled since 2022, weighed down by an anaemic economy and a\ndrop in foreign capital inflows into China's markets. Higher\nU.S. rates and falling Chinese ones have also kept it under\npressure.\n    The offshore yuan fell around 0.3% to 7.2854 per dollar\nafter the Reuters story.

One Quectel Wireless stock can currently be bought for about CNH 42.6599 on popular exchanges. Quectel Wireless has a current market capitalization of CNH 11.3 bn and approximately CNH 114.8 mn worth of Quectel Wireless was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 44.5. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 57.38 on 11/15/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 29.78 on 02/06/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Quectel Wireless\n\nTitle: Quectel Wireless Solutions: A Steady Performer with Room for Growth Investors looking for a stable and promising player in the wireless solutions space may want to take a closer look at Quectel Wireless Solutions Co Ltd (QWS). Despite lacking recent news, the company's historical performance and technical indicators paint a picture of a steady performer with potential for growth. According to data from Finanzen.net, QWS closed at 43.25 CNH on August 29th, just shy of its 52-week high of 57.38 CNH reached on November 14th, 2023. This suggests that the stock has been trending upwards over the past year, with a strong uptick in the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, the stock's 52-week low of 29.78 CNH on February 5th, 2024, indicates a relatively narrow trading range, indicating low volatility and stability. Looking at the company's valuation ratios, we see that the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 27.7, which is slightly above the industry average. Similarly, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 3.1 is also higher than the industry average, suggesting that investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of earnings and for each dollar of assets. While there have been no recent news updates on QWS, the company's solid financial performance and positive technical indicators suggest that it could be a good long-term investment opportunity. With a growing demand for wireless solutions and a proven track record of success, QWS may be well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory in the coming months and years.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Arctech Solar (688408.SS) traded up 1.43 % and now trades at CNY 67.65.

Current market capitalisation for Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial is CNH 13.5 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial is 29.25. Title: Technical Analysis: Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial (CFE) may be left scratching their heads with mixed signals from the company's latest quarterly results and historical price movements. While the company's revenue growth has been steady, its stock price has experienced significant fluctuations over the past year. Revenue Growth: Steady but Not Spectacular According to the company's most recent financial report, Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial's revenue grew by 4.5% compared to the same period last year. This moderate increase suggests that the company's core business remains stable, but investors may be disappointed by the lack of spectacular growth. However, it's worth noting that the company's revenue base is substantial, providing a solid foundation for future expansion. Stock Price Volatility: A Cautionary Tale CFE's stock price has been highly volatile over the past year, with significant fluctuations between its 52-week high and low. The stock peaked at 11.1 CNH on May 26, 2024, before plummeting to a low of 6.94286 CNH on February 4, 2024. This wide range of price movements reflects the uncertainty surrounding the company's long-term prospects and highlights the risks associated with investing in the sector. Valuation Metrics: A Mixed Bag When evaluating Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial's valuation metrics, investors may find both positive and negative indicators. The company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 31.05, which is relatively high compared to industry averages. However, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 2.85 indicates that the company's shares are undervalued based on its book value. These conflicting signals underscore the challenges of accurately assessing the company's true worth. Conclusion While Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial's revenue growth has been steady, its stock price has been highly volatile, reflecting the uncertainties surrounding the company's long-term prospects. Investors must carefully weigh the pros and cons of investing in the company, considering factors such as revenue growth, valuation metrics, and industry trends. Ultimately, a thorough analysis of these factors will help investors make an informed decision regarding their investment strategy for Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial.\n\n- Sinosoft (603927.SS) traded up 0.57 % and now trades at CNH 16.23. Sinosoft has a market capitalisation of CNH 13.3 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Sinosoft is 20.73. Title: Technical Analysis: Sinosoft's Mixed Signals Amidst Limited Recent News In the absence of recent news, we turn our attention to the technical aspects of Sinosoft Co Ltd (SSFT), a Chinese software development company. Despite the lack of fresh updates, SSFT's stock performance tells an interesting story. Let's dive into the details and analyze the company's current standing based solely on its historical data. Price Performance: A Tale of Two Halves SSFT's stock has exhibited a peculiar pattern over the past year, with two distinct halves. From October 2023 to February 2024, the stock experienced a steady climb, reaching its 52-week high of 24.6214 CNH on October 10th, 2023. This period saw a significant increase in investor interest, possibly due to strong financial results or optimism surrounding the company's future prospects. However, since then, the stock has witnessed a sharp decline, falling to a 52-week low of 14.8 CNH on February 4th, 2024. This downward trend could be attributed to various factors such as changes in market sentiments, industry developments, or potential challenges faced by the company. Key Ratios: P/E and P/B At present, SSFT's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 20.58, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 20 times the company's earnings per share. While this may seem relatively high, it's essential to consider the company's growth prospects and future earning potential before making any conclusions. Moreover, SSFT's Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio is currently at 4.22, which suggests that investors are willing to pay roughly four times the company's book value per share. Again, while this might seem high compared to other similar companies, it's crucial to evaluate the company's fundamentals before drawing definitive conclusions. Technical Outlook From a technical standpoint, SSFT's chart patterns suggest a mixed outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. However, the Moving Averages (MA) indicate a bearish crossover, hinting at a possible downtrend. Conclusion While there have been no recent news updates on Sinosoft Co Ltd, a closer examination of the company's historical stock performance reveals a tale of two halves. With a mixed technical outlook and key ratios hovering around their respective averages, investors must carefully assess the company's fundamentals before making any investment decisions. As always, it's essential to stay informed and monitor further developments to gain a better understanding of SSFT's future trajectory.\n\n- Sinopep-allsino Bio Pharmaceutical (688076.SS) traded up 1.19 % and now trades at CNY 54.08.

Current Price and Past Performance As of September 15th, 2024, BMTC's last closed price was 96.07 CNY. This marks a slight increase from its 52-week low of 92.55 CNY recorded on August 19th, 2024. However, the stock has yet to recover from its 52-week high of 144 CNY reached on November 14th, 2023. This suggests that while the company may be experiencing some growth, it still faces challenges in regaining its previous peak performance. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio One key metric that investors often look at is the price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio). For BMTC, this stands at 125.926, indicating that the market expects the company to perform well in the long run. Additionally, the price to book ratio (P/B ratio) of 11.8033 suggests that the company's stock value is undervalued compared to its assets. Technical Indicators Looking at technical indicators can provide further insights into BMTC's potential for future gains or losses. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 53.67, suggesting that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a bullish crossover, which could indicate an upward trend in the near future. Conclusion While Beijing Balance Medical Technology Co Ltd has shown some signs of growth, its mixed performance over the past year suggests that investors should exercise caution before making any investment decisions. Nevertheless, with a strong P/E ratio and undervalued P/B ratio, there may be opportunities for savvy traders to capitalize on BMTC's potential. As always, thorough research and consultation with financial experts are recommended before making any investments.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Quectel Wireless\n\nThe Quectel Wireless Solutions Co Ltd is a Chinese company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

Despite a lack of recent news, WIM's technical indicators paint a picture of a steadily trending asset. According to data from finanzen.net, WIM's last known news dates back to August 27th, with the stock closing at 10.37 CNH. However, looking beyond the surface, WIM has shown impressive performance in the past year. Its 52-week high of 17.47 CNH was reached on September 10th, 2023, and its 52-week low of 9.7 CNH occurred on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial potential for growth, especially considering WIM's current price sits well above its 52-week low. Furthermore, WIM's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 27.87, indicating that the market has priced in significant growth expectations for the company. Similarly, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 2.05 suggests that investors are confident in WIM's ability to generate profits and grow its assets.

Additionally, WIM's moving averages show a bullish trend, with the 50-day moving average crossing above the 200-day moving average, signaling a possible upward momentum.

Savvy investors may want to take advantage of the current quiet period to accumulate shares before the next wave of growth propels WIM forward.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Midea (000333.SZ) traded down -3.06 % and now trades at CNY 60.75. Midea has a market capitalisation of CNY 440.2 bn. Midea has a current price to earnings ratio of 11.72. Midea, a global leader in home appliances, has made headlines at this year's IFA exhibition in Berlin with its groundbreaking new products. The company has showcased a range of innovative smart home appliances under the theme \"Friendly Innovations for Homes.\" These include next-generation smart appliances such as built-in ovens and air conditioners that are designed to make life easier and more convenient for consumers.

Wuliangye Yibin has a market capitalisation of CNH 464.1 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Wuliangye Yibin is 14.4.\n\n- Baidu (9888.HK) traded down -0.88 % and now trades at HKD 80.1. Baidu has a market capitalisation of HKD 209.4 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Baidu is 10.53. In recent news, investors have been advised to exercise caution when considering purchasing shares of Baidu Inc., a leading Chinese language internet search provider. Two major risks have been identified that may impact the company's performance and potentially lead to a \"value trap\" for investors. Firstly, concerns have been raised about the potential for data leaks and model tampering due to the lack of transparency in Baidu's artificial intelligence (AI) supply chain. This risk has been highlighted by the introduction of a new industry standard aimed at addressing these issues, which was developed under the United Nations framework and includes participation from major tech companies like Ant Financial, Tencent, Baidu, Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Secondly, there are fears that Baidu's stock could be overvalued, potentially making it a value trap for investors. Analysts have noted that the company's current valuation does not accurately reflect its underlying fundamentals, and that any disappointment in future earnings could result in a significant decline in share price. Despite these risks, Baidu remains a key player in China's technology landscape, and its involvement in the development of the new AI supply chain standard demonstrates its commitment to ensuring the integrity of its products and services. As such, investors may still consider Baidu as a viable long-term investment opportunity, but should proceed with caution and carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards before making any decisions.\n\n- Beijing-shanghai High Speed Railway (601816.SS) traded down -0.92 % and now trades at CNH 5.35. Beijing-shanghai High Speed Railway has a market capitalisation of CNH 269.1 bn. Beijing-shanghai High Speed Railway has a current price to earnings ratio of 21.08. Beijing-Shanghai High Speed Railway's Recent Performance Hints at Stability Investors looking for stable assets may find interest in Beijing-Shanghai High Speed Railway (BSHSR), whose recent performance has been consistent and promising. As of August 23rd, the company's last closed price stood at 5.68 CNY, with a 52-week high of 5.88 CNY recorded on July 31st, and a 52-week low of 4.63 CNY on January 7th. These figures suggest that BSHSR has maintained a relatively narrow trading range over the past year, indicating stability in its financial health and operations. Technical Analysis Points to Upside Potential A closer look at BSHSR's technical indicators reveals several signs of upside potential. The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 54.76, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, leaving room for further growth. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a bullish crossover, indicating that the short-term moving average has crossed above the long-term moving average, which could be an indication of an upward trend. Valuation Ratios Favorable Compared to Industry Peers When compared to industry peers, BSHSR appears to be undervalued based on its Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.2325 and Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 1.44042. This suggests that investors may be able to purchase shares in the company at a discount relative to its peers, potentially leading to higher returns in the future. In conclusion, Beijing-Shanghai High Speed Railway's recent performance and technical indicators hint at stability and potential for upside growth. Furthermore, valuation ratios compare favorably to industry peers, making BSHSR an attractive option for investors seeking stable and profitable investments in the transportation sector.\n\n- Citic Securities (CI9.MU) traded flat 0 % and now trades at HKD 18.87. Citic Securities has a market capitalisation of HKD 266 bn. Citic Securities has a current price to earnings ratio of 8.58. CITIC Securities: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Despite lacking recent news, CITIC Securities' (CITI) stock has been trending upwards, with its last closing price of 1.34 EUR representing a significant increase from its 52-week low of 1.3 EUR. However, the stock has yet to reach its 52-week high of 1.9 EUR, set on December 11th, 2023. A closer look at CITI's technical indicators paints a mixed picture. The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 58.47, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, on the other hand, suggests that the stock may be due for a correction, as the MACD line is below the signal line. In terms of valuation, CITI's Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 15.8596, which is higher than the industry average. Additionally, the stock's Price to Book (P/B) ratio of 1.10903 indicates that investors are paying more for each dollar of book value than they would for similar companies. Overall, while CITI's upward trend is promising, investors may want to exercise caution before jumping into the stock. The mixed technical indicators and elevated valuations suggest that the stock may be due for a pullback or consolidation period in the near future. Nonetheless, long-term investors who believe in the company's fundamentals may view this as an opportunity to buy the dip and accumulate shares at a discounted price.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Wecome Intelligent Manufacturing\n\nThe Wecome Intelligent Manufacturing Co Ltd is a Chinese company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "(Adds details and comments, updates prices)\n       SHANGHAI/BEIJING, June 11 (Reuters) - China's yuan hit a\nnear seven-month low against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, as\ninvestors returned from a long weekend break and caught up with\nbroad greenback strength in overseas markets.\n    The losses did not extend as major state-owned banks quickly\nstepped in to sell dollars for yuan in the onshore spot foreign\nexchange market to stabilise the local currency, sources told\nReuters.\n    Yuan's weakness was largely in line with other currencies,\nas the dollar was supported by higher U.S. Treasury yields in\nthe aftermath of surprisingly robust domestic jobs data on\nFriday, which sparked a dramatic paring of bets for Federal\nReserve's interest rate cuts this year. [FRX/]\n    The firmer greenback sent the official yuan midpoint to the\nweakest level in nearly five months. Prior to market opening,\nthe People's Bank of China set the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC> at\n7.1135 per dollar, 29 pips weaker than the previous fix of\n7.1106, and was the softest since Jan. 19.\n    The spot yuan is allowed to trade in a 2% range on either\nside of the daily official midpoint fixing. The guidance on\nTuesday capped the yuan's downside limit at 7.2558 per dollar.\n    The cut in the official midpoint fixing has opened the door\nfor some weakness in spot prices, said a trader at a Chinese\nbank.\n    In the spot market, the onshore yuan <CNY=CFXS> opened at\n7.2502 per dollar and weakened to a low of 7.2531 in early\ntrades, the weakest level since Nov. 16, 2023. It last traded at\n7.2529 by midday.\n    \"Before the Fed starts cutting rates, the yuan exchange rate\nmay maintain the trend of depreciation against the U.S. dollar\nand appreciation against a basket of currencies,\" analysts at\nChina International Capital Corporation said in a note. \n    They expect the yuan to maintain relatively low volatilities\nin the second half of the year against the backdrop of Beijing's\npolicy stance towards a stable currency.\n    The yuan's trade-weighted CFETS index <.CFSCNYI>, a gauge\nthat measures the yuan's value against its major trading\npartners, stood at 99.97, its highest level since May 14,\naccording to Reuters calculation based on official data. \n    The CFETS index has gained 2.6% year-to-date, when the spot\nyuan lost 2.1% to the greenback.\n    Separately, traders said they would pay close attention to\nChina's May credit lending data this week to gauge the health of\nthe broad economy.\n    A Reuters poll suggested that China's new yuan loans likely\nrebounded in May from April, as the central bank told lenders to\nquicken bank lending to support the economy.\n    The offshore yuan <CNH=D3> followed the softening trend to\ntrade at 7.2669 per dollar as of midday, compared with the\nprevious close of 7.2656.\n\n (Reporting by Shanghai and Beijing Newsroom; Editing by Sonali\nPaul and Rashmi Aich)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

The New York Times' closely-watched 'swingometer' projected a 93% chance of Trump winning, while Treasury yields rose to four-month highs as some betting sites significantly favoured him. However, the House of Representatives is still too close to call. Four years after departing the White House, Trump has advanced to the brink of a remarkable political revival by defeating Democrat Kamala Harris in the battleground states of North Carolina, Georgia & Pennsylvania. The euro, yen, and antipodean currencies have experienced declines as a result of the 1.5% increase in the US dollar index, which is the largest increase since March 2020. The dollar's sharp increase against the offshore yuan prompted reports that Chinese banks were selling dollars to slow the yuan's decline. China is perceived as being at the forefront of tariff risk, and its currency is currently trading at a high level of uncertainty, with implied volatility against the dollar circling record highs. As investors anticipate a meeting of top policymakers in Beijing this week to sanction local government debt refinancing and spending, Chinese markets have declined from an almost one-month high.\n\nEuropean stock futures were less ebullient due to the potential for a global trade war and the threat to EU exports if Trump's tariff policies are implemented. Additionally, there was a possibility that Trump could disengage from NATO, which would necessitate an increase in defence expenditures in Europe and would also serve to strengthen Russia's territorial ambitions. Aside from US political developments, macro events that could potentially impact markets on Wednesday include: Services within the Eurozone Producer prices for September and PMIs for October. September industrial orders in Germany. Services provided by the United States PMI for October.  \n\nOvernight Newswire Updates of Note\n\n * Trump Wins The Critical Battleground State Of Pennsylvania \n * PBoC Affirms Supportive Monetary Policy\n * Japan PM Ishiba Preps Meeting With Biden, China’s XI\n * Japan PMI, Confidence Shrinks On Softer Sales\n * UBS Pushes Back RBA First Rate Cut Forecast To May 2025\n * NZ Unemployment Rate Rises Less Than Forecast\n * Hong Kong Stocks Slide, Traders Pare Risky Bets\n * US Stock, Yields Rise As Markets Await Election Outcome\n * Nvidia Rides AI Wave Past Apple As World largest Company\n * Crypto Surge To Record Levels On Early Trump Lead\n * Spike In UK Borrowing Cost Wipes Out Fiscal Headroom\n *           (Sourced from reliable financial news outlets)\n\n \n\nFX Options Expiries For 10am New York Cut \n\n(1BLN+ represents larger expiries, more magnetic when trading within daily ATR)\n\n * EUR/USD: 1.0650 (3.9BLN), 1.0700 (686M), 1.0725 (1.5BLN)\n * 1.0750 (900M) 1.0800 (2.4BLN)\n * USD/CHF: 0.8675 (241M), 0.8700 (1.4BLN), 0.8800 (289M)\n * EUR/GBP: 0.8390-0.8400 (621M)\n * GBP/USD: 1.3000 (331M)\n * AUD/USD: 0.6475 (689M), 0.6510 (728M), 0.6525 (817M)\n * AUD/NZD: 1.1010 (397M), 1.1100 (300M)\n * USD/CAD: 1.3800 (555M), 1.3875 (420M), 1.4025 (267M), 1.4050 (442M)\n * USD/JPY: 153.50 (728M), 155.65 (350M)  \n\nCFTC Data As Of 1/11/24\n\n * Net USD G10 long +$8.88bn to +$18.7bn in Oct 23-29 IMM period; $IDX +0.13%\n * EUR +0.17%: speculative positions decreased by 21.8k contracts, now at -50.3k, lower ECB view weighs on EUR\n * JPY +1.55%; speculative positions decreased by 37.6k contracts, now at +25k, on hawkish Fed, less dovish BoJ\n * GBP +0.27%; speculative positions decreased by 8.2k contracts, now at +66.4k; less-dovish BoE lends support.

That said, the uptrend in USD/JPY and Treasury-JGB yields spreads will\npersist unless hard U.S. Feb data detract. Treasury yields are already rebounding from the pre-\nand post PMI pullback that helped drag USD/JPY off its 150.645 EBS high by last Friday's swing\nhigh at 150.65. Prices are above the downtrend line at 150.34 from February's 2024 high, and the\ntenkan at 149.905 buttressed Thursday's 150.02 low. Two-year Treasury-JGB yields, the primary\ndriver of USD/JPY prices, are up 4bps Thursday and at their highest since Dec. 13, the date of\nthe Fed's final 2023 meeting. However, that's still well below 2023's 5.15% peak due to pricing\nin of 84bps of Fed rate cuts and at least 10bps on the BoJ side this year, though Fed cuts of\nover 150bps had been priced in at one point. If core PCE and income on Feb. 29 rise as forecast,\nand consumption is +0.3% versus the 0.8% drop in January retail sales, USD/JPY should make new\n2024 highs with an eye on 2022/23's 32-year peaks at 151.94/92, particularly if the February\njobs report is solid. Japan's recession risk, despite the Nikkei 225 breaching its prior peak\nfrom 34-years ago, and doubts about how widespread yearly wage increases will be distributed,\nprecludes more than a minor reduction in the BoJ's extreme accommodation. Lots of Fed speakers\ntoday, but late Waller views will be the top watch. Charts: https://tmsnrt.rs/3OUSPsm  &\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/3ThUlrb \n \n Sterling slides from post-UK PMI high after US data affirms Fed tack\nSterling's early European rise above daily cloud base resistance at 1.2702, after mixed UK PMI\ndata, has completely unraveled in early NorAm after U.S. jobless claims and PMI data indicated\nU.S. employment and growth remain firm providing further affirmation of the Fed's less dovish\nrate tack in 2024. Today's GBP/USD price action highlights the symmetrical nature of U.S.-UK\ninflation expectations, which, for the time being is likely to keep GBP/USD anchored within the\npound's 1.2518-1.2788 2024 range. The recent yaw in GBP/USD comes on the back of less-dovish\ndata and narratives by Fed and BoE members. Despite more-dovish aspirations by developed market\ncentral banks, eager to stir growth in flagging economies, inflation remains elevated precluding\nany near-term pivot to lower rates. Under the current conditions of G7 leading U.S. growth and\nG7 leading UK inflation, with core above 5%, the tug-of-war between sterling traders, reacting\nto individual pieces of data should be viewed as noise as we remain ensconced in the narrow 2024\nrange. Should U.S inflation resume its downward path to the Fed's 2% target or UK growth surge,\nsterling traders may be emboldened to add to recent bullish tones making a credible run to new\n2024 highs. However, if U.S. and UK inflation stall near current levels, range sledding will\ncontinue.  Chart:  https://tmsnrt.rs/42KCs7r\n \n \n Chart of the Day (EUR/USD)\n EUR/USD erased overnight gains and neared flat Thursday after effects of Euro Zone and U.S.\ndata took hold. Indeed, the pair may remain within its recent ranges unless policy paths for the\nFed and ECB diverge. The pair rallied on February HCOB composite PMI indicating some signs of a\nrecovery. The data helped rally yields <DE2YT=RR> as investors priced in a lower probability for\nECB rate cuts. EUR/USD reversed course as the dollar rallied and weekly claims data unexpectedly\nfell to suggest the job market remains robust. Investors reduced the probability for Fed cuts\nafter the report. The market still expects the Fed and ECB to cut, but the totality of cuts has\nbeen lowered. Investors expect the Fed to cut only 85bps in 2024 and the ECB to cut roughly\n95bps for 2024. The small difference in the magnitude of cuts expected will make it difficult\nfor EUR/USD to break free of its current range. Investors will be focused on U.S. February PCE\nand payroll data. Below estimate results for both data points may drive investors to price in\nmore aggressive rate cuts by the Fed. Policy paths between the two central banks may then\ndiverge, and EUR/USD may make a run toward its December high.

New entrants at exchanges have driven new highs in listed foreign exchange markets in the first quarter, in a sign that a long-awaited shift from the much larger over-the-counter segment is finally emerging.\n\nThe Singapore Exchange (SGX) last week reported a 30% increase in its FX futures franchise in the first quarter, compared to the same period in 2023, to 12.1 million contracts. That included a 47% year-on-year increase in its largest contract, on the dollar/Renminbi (USD/CNH) currency pair, as well as a 76% increase in the equivalent Korean won contract (KRW/USD) and a 9% rise in Indian Rupee/US dollar (INR/USD) futures activity.\n\nKC Lam, the exchange's global head of FX and rates, said the spike in activity has been a function of rising market uncertainty related to geopolitical events such as elections in the region.\n\n\"A lot of investors are positioning for changes in the market driven by events such as domestic elections this year,\" Lam told FOW. \"What that has meant is record numbers in our rupee, renminbi and Korean won currency pair contracts in the quarter. This is a clear indication that FX risk management activity will be a key theme.\"\n\nAll three currencies hit open interest records in the period, as USD/CNH, INR/USD and KRW/USD futures open positions rose 55%, 114% and 391% year-on-year at the end of the quarter.

That has been a function of the fact that larger funds and dealers have onboarded with the Singapore venue since the roll-out of regulatory capital rules affecting asset managers and banks, Lam said.\n\n\"Throughout the last year, what we have seen were new participants coming on board and that has fed single day trading records and a rising open interest trend,\" he added. \"The interesting thing there is that we are seeing more diverse players such as macro funds and banks connecting to us.\"\n\nBeyond the Asia Pacific, Deutsche Boerse-owned Eurex has also reported an uptick in its FX futures franchise, with a 10% year-on-year increase in March trading volume to 311,330 contracts. That translated to a 16% increase for the first quarter compared to the same period in 2023 while the German exchange also hit a record open interest level of €8.2 billion (?7bn) at the end of the period, including €6.6 billion in notional in held in Euro/US dollar futures, its largest contract. The exchange said the increase has outstripped the normal uptick typical in March as clients roll their positions.\n\n\"Typically we see an effect in March where clients roll their existing exposure into the next quarter, and this year in particular what we have seen is new clients opening positions that has resulted in open interest increasing, and adoption of block trades and exchange-for-physical trades that has contributed to year-on-year volume growth,\" Tobias Rank, head of FX product sales at Eurex, said in an interview.\n\nThe growth in block trading can be seen in the green section of the bar in graph 1 below, labelled \"OTC volume\", and represents bilateral trades booked on the futures exchange.\n\nGraph 1 - March FX derivatives volume rises on Eurex\n\nSource: Eurex\n\nIn addition, Eurex at the start of March implemented a new liquidity provider scheme for its FX futures, updating incentives with new fee rebates and a revenue share for its order book liquidity providers. That should help fuel further adoption and accelerate daily liquidity in the second quarter, it said.\n\n\"Since January last year, we have seen 11 banks onboarding as clearers, with a total of 22 clearing members now live on the FX service,\" Rank added. \"That has been driven by sell-side clients extending their capabilities to meet the changes in the regulatory landscape. The next phase we are observing is those firms enabling their FX futures execution services more fully, so more tier 1 banks are joining the first movers by connecting their trading desks to execute futures with clients.\"\n\nSGX in September consolidated its wider foreign exchange and fixed income businesses into a new wholesale markets and platforms unit. That has helped the exchange capitalise on the trend towards exchange-traded contracts, Lam said.\n\n\"Within the wider SGX FX business, the off-exchange volume has certainly also begun to be redirected onto the exchange,\" he added. \"That has been driven by regulatory pressures and enabled by technology – where, for example, banks have been able to automate exchange-for-physical functionality through their portals for clients. There are lots of interesting opportunities there to further facilitate that flow.\"\n\nRival CME Group, which also consolidated its FX futures and wholesale venues into one division in August, in the first quarter reported a new record for large open interest holders in the first quarter, at 1,333 entities. The exchange, which operates the largest foreign exchange futures market, saw open interest of nearly 3 million contracts in March, 6% higher year-on-year and its highest level since November 2023, according to monthly disclosures. The exchange has cited open interest highs for its Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Mexican Peso futures in the quarter, further reflecting the depth of the market. CME volume figures for the month of March and the first quarter were flat on last year."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

One Ofilm stock can currently be bought for about CNH 8.53 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Ofilm stocks is 3.3 bn. Ofilm has a current market capitalization of CNH 27 bn and approximately CNH 0 worth of Ofilm was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Ofilm has traded 15.08 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 8.48. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 12.3 on 11/07/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 5.74 on 09/21/2023.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Ofilm\n\nOfilm Group Co Ltd has been making waves in the tech industry with its latest contract as a supplier for Huawei's Mate 60 phone, despite previously being blacklisted by the US and dropped by Apple as a supplier. This turnaround has investors taking notice, with the stock closing at 8.85 CNH on its last trading day. Looking back over the past year, Ofilm's stock has experienced significant fluctuations, reaching a 52-week high of 12.3 CNH on November 6th, 2023, before falling to a low of 5.74 CNH on September 20th, 2023. Despite these ups and downs, the stock has maintained a strong price-to-earnings ratio of 56.65 and a price-to-book ratio of 7.52. Technical analysts are keeping a close eye on Ofilm's chart patterns, looking for signs of potential future movements. The stock's recent consolidation period, marked by a sideways trend between 8.5 CNH and 10 CNH, could be an indication of a building base that could lead to a breakout rally in the coming months. Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) is currently sitting at 48.17, indicating that the stock may be due for a bounce. However, it's important to note that the stock's valuation is already relatively high compared to its peers, with a price-to-earnings ratio well above the industry average. As such, any further gains may be limited without a corresponding increase in earnings or other positive developments. Overall, while there have been no recent news updates on Ofilm, the company's solid track record and promising contract with Huawei suggest that it may continue to be a player in the tech industry for years to come.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Flat Glass (6865.HK) traded down -1.8 % and now trades at HKD 10.16. Flat Glass has a market capitalisation of HKD 39.1 bn. Flat Glass has a current price to earnings ratio of 7.31. Hong Kong-listed Flat Glass Group Co Ltd (FGGC) has been making waves in the glass manufacturing industry with its impressive financial performance. Despite the lack of recent news, investors can still gain valuable insights into the company's growth trajectory by analyzing its historical stock data. According to the latest figures available, FGGC closed at HK$10.90 on August 29th, representing a significant drop from its 52-week high of HK$21.40 recorded on April 8th. This downward trend may be attributed to market volatility or potential changes in the company's operations. However, the stock's resilience is evident in its ability to maintain a relatively stable price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 7.31 and a modest price-to-book ratio (P/B) of 1.04. Technical analysts note that FGGC's current price is hovering near its 52-week low, presenting an attractive entry point for long-term investors seeking value plays. Moreover, the stock's strong fundamentals, including a healthy balance sheet and consistent profitability, suggest that any dips in the share price could be short-lived. In conclusion, while there have been no recent developments surrounding FGGC, savvy investors can still benefit from examining the company's historical data to identify potential opportunities for growth. With a solid track record and promising outlook, FGGC remains an intriguing prospect for those looking to capitalize on the glass manufacturing sector's continued expansion.\n\n- Gds Holdings Ltd (9698.HK) traded down -2.25 % and now trades at HKD 16.4. Gds Holdings Ltd has a market capitalisation of HKD 23.6 bn. --- GDS Holdings Ltd (GDS): A Technical Analysis Investors looking for strong international growth may want to take note of GDS Holdings Ltd (GDS), a company that has been making waves in the technology sector. Despite a lack of recent news, the company's previous quarterly earnings call transcript highlighted its impressive expansion into new markets. According to data from feeds.feedburner.com, the last known news about GDS was on August 22nd, with the company's stock closing at 16.5 HKD. This represents a significant increase from its 52-week low of 4.89 HKD on February 5th, indicating a strong upward trend. Looking at the company's historical stock prices, we can see that GDS reached a 52-week high of 16.98 HKD on August 26th, just four days after its earnings call. This suggests that investors were optimistic about the company's future prospects, driving up the stock price. From a technical analysis standpoint, GDS appears to be trading above its short-term moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This could indicate that the stock is experiencing a bullish momentum, which could continue if the company continues to deliver strong results. However, it's important to note that the stock is currently trading below its long-term moving average, such as the 50-week moving average. This could suggest that while the stock may be experiencing short-term gains, it may not be sustainable in the long run without further positive developments. Overall, GDS Holdings Ltd (GDS) seems to be a promising investment opportunity for those looking for exposure to the technology sector. However, it's essential to keep an eye on any future developments and monitor the stock's performance before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Beijing Fourth Paradigm (6682.HK) traded down -0.67 % and now trades at HKD 34.75. Beijing Fourth Paradigm has a market capitalisation of HKD 16.2 bn. Title: Beijing Fourth Paradigm's Shares Stagnant Despite Strong Interim Results In a recent announcement, Beijing Fourth Paradigm Technology Co., Ltd. unveiled their 2024 interim results, showcasing a remarkable performance despite the challenges posed by the ongoing global economic uncertainty. However, the company's shares have remained stagnant, failing to reflect the strength of their financial standing. According to the latest data, the last known closing price of Beijing Fourth Paradigm was 37.3 Hong Kong dollars (HKD) per share, representing a modest increase from the previous year's interim results. The company's 52-week high stands at 115 HKD, recorded on March 6th, 2024, while the 52-week low is 37 HKD, observed on February 4th, 2024. Despite the impressive interim results, the stock market has yet to respond positively, with the price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) standing at -16.2, indicating that investors remain cautious about the company's future prospects. Moreover, the price to book ratio (P/B Ratio) is 3.06, suggesting that the market may be undervaluing Beijing Fourth Paradigm's assets. Technical analysts suggest that the lack of movement in the company's shares can be attributed to the overall market sentiment, which has been influenced by geopolitical tensions and concerns over inflation. However, they note that the strong fundamentals of Beijing Fourth Paradigm, coupled with the company's proven track record of delivering consistent results, could provide a solid foundation for future growth. In conclusion, while the short-term outlook for Beijing Fourth Paradigm's shares remains uncertain, the company's robust financial performance and promising long-term potential make it an attractive investment opportunity for risk-tolerant investors seeking exposure to the technology sector.\n\n- Chaozhou Three-circle (300408.SZ) traded down -2.1 % and now trades at CNY 29.54. Current market capitalisation for Chaozhou Three-circle is CNY 58.5 bn. Chaozhou Three-circle has a current price to earnings ratio of 34.17.\n\n- Semiconductor Manufacturing (0981.HK) traded down -0.5 % and now trades at HKD 15.56. Semiconductor Manufacturing has a market capitalisation of HKD 25 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Semiconductor Manufacturing is 31.92. Title: Technical Analysis: Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SHSE:688981) Investors looking for a potential bargain in the semiconductor industry may want to take a closer look at Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SHSE:688981), whose shares have been trading at a significant discount compared to their historical highs. As of August 21st, the stock closed at 16.9 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), down from its 52-week high of 57.74 HKD reached on October 22nd, 2023. This represents a decline of approximately 71% from its peak. Despite this significant correction, the company's fundamentals remain strong, with a Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 25.2482 and a Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 0.888603. These ratios suggest that the stock may be undervalued relative to its peers in the industry. Looking at the chart, we can see that the stock has been trending lower since reaching its peak in late 2023. However, the recent downturn has pushed the stock into oversold territory, as indicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 28.67. This could potentially signal a bottoming out of the stock's price and a possible reversal in the near future. Furthermore, the Moving Averages (MA) are also indicating a potential buy signal. The 50-day MA is currently at 18.32 HKD, while the 200-day MA is at 31.43 HKD. With the stock trading well below both MAs, it may be an attractive entry point for long-term investors seeking exposure to the semiconductor sector. In conclusion, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SHSE:688981) appears to be undervalued based on its fundamentals and technical indicators. While the stock has experienced a significant decline from its peak, the recent downturn may have pushed the price into oversold territory, suggesting a potential reversal in the near future. Long-term investors may want to consider taking a position in the stock, with a view towards the eventual recovery of the semiconductor industry and the potential for the stock to revert to its historical averages.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Ofilm\n\nThe OFILM Group Co., Ltd. is a company based in Shenzhen, China, that specializes in manufacturing electronics components.

Against the yen, the\ndollar fell 2.3% to 143.13, close to the weakest level for the\nyear.\n  \n        Weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data, along with\ndisappointing earnings reports from large technology firms and\nheightened concerns over the Chinese economy, have sparked a\nglobal sell-off in stocks, oil and high-yielding currencies in\nthe past week as investors sought the safety of cash.\n    The selling continued on Monday, with U.S. Treasury yields\nfalling further, stock indexes in the red, bitcoin <BTC=> dumped\nand the dollar losing ground.\n    \"As traders continue to pile into bets that the Fed is going\nto ease a very large amount more this year than thought even as\nrecently as Wednesday, USD is taking a bit of a beating with a\ncouple notable exceptions,\" Helen Given, FX trader at Monex USA\nin Washington, said.\n        \"Friday's NFP report was a bit of a shock to the global\nsystem and markets are very worried that the US may no longer be\na viable driver of global growth,\" she said.\n  \n        Treasury yields have been falling sharply since last\nweek, when the Federal Reserve kept the policy rate in its\ncurrent 5.25% to 5.50% range while Chair Jerome Powell opened\nthe possibility of a rate cut in September.\n  \n        But by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate\nhad jumped, expectations for rate cuts rose.\n  \n        The Japanese yen's surge comes as traders aggressively\nunwound carry trades. So-called carry trades, where investors\nborrow in money from economies with low interest rates such as\nJapan or Switzerland to fund investments in higher-yielding\nassets elsewhere, have been popular in recent years.\n  \n        On Monday, Fed fund futures reflected traders pricing a\nnear 100% chance of a 50 basis point cut at the central bank's\nSeptember meeting, according to CME FedWatch. Futures imply 127\nbasis points of cuts this year, LSEG data showed.\n  \n        \"The Japanese equity selloff during Asian trading\nspooked markets in a big way, coupled with the Yen's resurgence,\nand we may be seeing the so-called 'panic spiral' that many have\nbeen concerned about,\" Monex's Given said.\n  \n        Meanwhile, the Swiss franc <CHF=EBS>, another popular\ncarry trade funding currency, was about 1% higher at 0.8499 to\nthe dollar. The franc, a traditional safe haven, was also\ntrading at a seven-month high.\n    \"(It) all seems a significant over-reaction to one weak jobs\nreport, particularly when we know that the FOMC shan’t over\nreact from a policy perspective,\" Michael Brown, market analyst\nat Pepperstone in London, said.\n    The dollar found some relief against the British pound as\nthe marked deterioration in global investor risk sentiment\nsapped demand for riskier currencies. \n        The depreciation of \n    Mexico's peso\n     extended into its third day on Monday, and the U.S. dollar\nrose 1.9% to 19.53 pesos, on investor risk aversion. \n  \n        In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin <BTC=> and ether <ETH=>\nplunged on Monday to multi-month lows as investors a rushed out\nof risky assets.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Fitch Revises CNH's Outlook to Negative; Affirms IDR at 'BBB+'New York: Fitch Ratings has issued the following commentary:\n\nFitch Ratings has revised CNH Industrial N.V.'s (CNH) Outlook to Negative from Stable, while affirming its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured debt at 'BBB+'.\n\nThe change in Outlook reflects pressure on CNH's profitability and leverage metrics due to a sharp downturn in the agriculture market. We forecast CNH's EBITDA net leverage to remain above its negative rating sensitivity at end-2024 and end-2025, despite our assumption of better cash generation in the latter year. Despite the unchanged fundamentals of the market and CNH's strong business profile, the timing of market and leverage recovery remains uncertain post-2025.\n\nThe ratings reflect CNH's strong market position in the agricultural equipment manufacturing (AG), especially in heavy tractors, and a competitive product portfolio. This helps support resilient pricing even in a weak market environment.\n\n\n KEY RATING DRIVERS \n Weaker Profit in Market Downturn: Fitch forecasts CNH's EBITDA margins at around 10% for 2024-2025, weighed down by an inability to absorb fixed costs in a downcycle, temporarily breaching our rating sensitivity of 12%. We expect EBITDA margins to rebound to 12% in 2026, aided by volume recovery, resilient pricing from a refreshed product line-up and an optimised cost base. However, market uncertainty remains.\n\nVolume upside may stem from a new US farm bill under the new administration, together with its trade policy on crops, and de-escalation of the prevailing Ukrainian conflict that could result in rising demand for AG and construction equipment. This is not incorporated into our rating case, but a slower-than-expected market recovery or a negative structural shift would lead to negative rating action.\n\nSound FCF Generation: CNH's historical free cash flow (FCF) margins have consistently exceeded 4%, reflecting its strong cash conversion and cost past-through during the inflationary period and capex flexibility. Fitch expects CNH to maintain solid FCF generation at similar levels until 2028, except for 2024 due to a working-capital outflow.\n\nWe expect CHN's EBITDA net leverage to exceed its 1.5x downgrade threshold at end-2024 and end-2025, due to weak market conditions and, consequently, lower revenue and EBITDA. Fitch believes the solid FCF margin will support reduction in EBITDA leverage to below 1x by end-2026. However, the timing of agriculture market recovery remains unclear, which is crucial to this assumption.\n\nAdjustment for Financial Services: Fitch rates CHN on an industrial-only basis and adjusts its consolidated debt to account for its financial service business (FS). In reviewing the maximum allowable multiple for FS, Fitch has concluded that its asset quality is on a par with that of peers and has hence revised the multiple to 4x from 3x. Its debt-to-equity ratio at FS is 8.6x, based on 1H24 financials, equivalent to an equity injection to FS of USD2.5 billion and a corresponding debt transfer to the group's industrial operations. The calculations include our assumptions regarding the interest rate environment.\n\nEfficiency Measures and Destocking: CNH has implemented cost-saving measures since the beginning of the year, which will yield USD480 million for 2024. Management has guided a further USD100 million-USD140 million savings from efficiency improvement in 2025, and Fitch has incorporated the lower end of this range in our operating margin assumption. CNH has proactively managed production down by 25%-30% annually in response to high dealer stocks and to more closely match real-time retail demand. We do not expect further destocking to be accompanied by large-scale pricing cuts to pressure margins.\n\nStrong Business Profile: CNH's end-market and product diversification is weaker than 'A' rated diversified industrial peers'. However, its overall business profile remains commensurate with the 'BBB' rating category, backed by good geographic diversification, strong market shares in AG and exposure to less cyclical end-markets. It is one of the largest and most diversified capital goods original equipment manufacturers globally, with strong market shares in most regions. CNH is a leader in Europe and the second largest AG equipment maker in the world.\n\nSupportive Long-Term Trends: CNH's business model enjoys supportive long-term trends. The AG business is underpinned by growing food demand and precision technologies that allow farmers to better tailor inputs like water and chemicals and to maximise crops. In this respect, the acquisition of Raven Technologies marked a step-up in CNH's efforts to become a global leader in precision AG. Demand for construction equipment is also benefitting from global infrastructure needs and increasing urbanisation.\n\nCapital Deployment Key to Deleveraging: The ratings reflect our assumption of a 30% dividend payout ratio and no additional share buybacks, apart from the announced plans. Fitch does not factor in sizable acquisitions in the ratings. A diverging capital deployment policy, including higher-than-expected dividend distributions, would further weigh on the leverage metrics and have negative rating implications.\n\n\n DERIVATION SUMMARY \n Fitch views CNH's business profile as being in line with the 'BBB' rating category in our criteria for the industry, which is characterised by market-leading positions in AG and construction equipment, a broad end-customer base and geographical diversification. Following the IVECO spin-off, CNH's end-market diversification and product portfolio are more limited than that of 'A' rated peers.\n\nCNH's EBITDA margin is structurally lower than that of peers in the 'A' category such as Caterpillar Inc (A+/Stable), Deere & Company (A+/Stable) and Honeywell International Inc. (A/Stable), reflecting the differences in scale and a higher cost base that CNH's new management is seeking to optimise. We view CNH's EBIT and FCF margins as strong for its rating.\n\nCNH's leverage profile is broadly in line with that of Fitch-rated industrial diversified peers in the 'BBB' rating category such as KION Group AG (BBB/Stable) and GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft (BBB/Positive). CNH's EBITDA gross leverage, at around 3x, is a significant outlier. This is offset by projected net EBITDA leverage trending toward 1x by 2026, aided by cash flow generation.\n\n\n KEY ASSUMPTIONS \n - Revenue to decline in 2024, in line with management guidance. Revenue to trough in 2025, followed by a recovery of 7.4% in 2026 and 4.3% in 2027\n\n- EBIT margin to decline but remain at double digits in 2024 and 2025, followed by increases in 2026 and 2027 as a result of cost savings and higher demand\n\n- Net working capital (NWC) outflow of USD1.2 billion in 2024 on high inventory levels. NWC inflows in 2025 and 2026 and reversing to moderate outflows in 2027\n\n- Capex to progress towards 2.5% of revenue\n\n- Dividend payout of 30% in 2024-2027\n\n- Restricted cash at 3% of sales to 2027\n\n\n RATING SENSITIVITIES \n Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade\n\n- EBITDA net leverage above 1.5x on a sustained basis\n\n- EBITDA margin below 12% and EBIT margin below 8% on a sustained basis\n\n- FCF margin below 2.5% on a sustained basis\n\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade\n\n- EBITDA margin above 16% and EBIT margin above 10% on a sustained basis\n\n- FCF margin above 4% on a sustained basis\n\n- Net cash position on a sustained basis\n\n\n BEST/WORST CASE RATING SCENARIO \n International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579.\n\n\n LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE \n At end-September 2024, immediately available cash and equivalent at industrial activities fell to USD1.4 billion, from USD3.5 billion at end-2023, due to negative FCF led by revenue and margin decrease, high NWC outflows and increased dividends. We expect CNH, during 4Q24, to reverse some of the NWC outflows but to remain FCF-negative for 2024. The group also has undrawn EUR3.25 billion committed credit lines maturing in 2029, with an upsize option of EUR500 million and an extension option by one year.\n\nCNH maintains strong capital-market access as underscored by its several outstanding euro- and US dollar-denominated bonds. Drawn banking lines and net inter-business debt represent a minor portion of the group's funding. As its outstanding bonds are currently at fixed rates, we expect a moderate impact from interest-rate changes.\n\n\n ISSUER PROFILE \n CNH is a global capital goods company that designs, manufactures, markets, and finances AG and construction equipment.\n\n\n REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING \n The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.\n\nClick here to access Fitch's latest quarterly Global Corporates Macro and Sector Forecasts data file which aggregates key data points used in our credit analysis. Fitch's macroeconomic forecasts, commodity price assumptions, default rate forecasts, sector key performance indicators and sector-level forecasts are among the data items included.\n\nESG CONSIDERATIONS \n CNH has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for GHG Emissions & Air Quality, due to stringent emission regulation, notably in Europe, which has a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the ratings in conjunction with other factors.\n\nThe highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.

The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 14.35 on 09/03/2024. 52 weeks low was at CNY 8.31 on 11/08/2023.\n\nSummary of the latest news for China Coal Energy\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: China Coal Energy's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain exposure to the Chinese energy sector may want to take a closer look at China Coal Energy Co Ltd (OTCMKTS: CCOZY), which has been experiencing a mix of positive and negative signals in recent months. Despite posting strong earnings results, the stock has struggled to maintain momentum, leaving analysts divided on its future prospects. Earnings Performance According to the latest report from American Banking News, China Coal Energy posted impressive earnings results on August 28th, with a profit of $0.16 per share, beating expectations by $0.03. This marks the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for the company, indicating a steady increase in demand for its coal products. Price Action However, despite these promising earnings, the stock has failed to sustain any significant gains. As of September 22nd, the last closing price was $12.93, down from its 52-week high of $14.35 on September 2nd. This drop can be attributed to investor hesitation due to the uncertain global economic environment and fluctuating commodity prices. Technical Indicators From a technical standpoint, China Coal Energy's performance appears to be mixed. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 52.67, suggesting that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator indicates a bearish crossover, hinting at a potential downward trend. Key Resistance and Support Levels Key resistance levels for China Coal Energy include $14.35 (52-week high), $13.50 (200-day moving average), and $12.50 (support level). Key support levels include $11.50 (200-day moving average), $10.50 (support level), and $9.50 (2019 low). Conclusion While China Coal Energy's earnings results suggest a healthy business, the stock's inability to maintain upward momentum raises concerns among investors. From a technical perspective, the MACD indicator suggests a potential downward trend, while the RSI remains neutral. Therefore, investors may want to approach this stock with caution, waiting for clearer signs of direction before making any investment decisions.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Cmoc (603993.SS) traded up 3.92 % and now trades at CNY 6.83.

This impressive performance is a testament to the company's resilience and adaptability in an ever-changing market. As of the last closing price of 7.44 HKD, Cmoc has seen significant growth over the past year, with its 52-week high reaching 9.87 HKD on April 21st, 2024. This represents a substantial increase of 27.6% from its previous 52-week high. Additionally, the stock has experienced a low of 4.12 HKD on February 14th, 2024, representing a gain of 83.7% since then. From a technical standpoint, Cmoc appears to be trending upwards, with strong support at around 7.44 HKD, the current closing price. The relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 62.67, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral position. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) line is currently at 8.47, which is above the signal line, indicating a bullish crossover. These indicators suggest that the uptrend may continue in the short term. Key Statistics: * Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 9.35 * Price to Book Ratio (P/B): 1.93 * 52-Week High: 9.87 HKD (April 21st, 2024) * 52-Week Low: 4.12 HKD (February 14th, 2024) Conclusion: CMOC Group Ltd has demonstrated remarkable resilience and adaptability in the face of an ever-changing market, resulting in a staggering 670% rise in net profit for the first half of 2024.

From a technical standpoint, Fuyao Glass Industry's current price of 46.9 HKD represents a moderate increase compared to its 52-week low. However, the stock's price to earnings ratio (P/E) of 17.27 and price to book ratio (P/B) of 3.43 suggest that it may be slightly overvalued based on its earnings and book value. Despite this, analysts remain optimistic about the company's future prospects. In their latest report, they noted that Fuyao Glass Industry has been expanding its product offerings and increasing its market share in the domestic Chinese market. Additionally, the company's strong financial position, with a low debt-to-equity ratio and ample cash reserves, bodes well for its long-term growth potential. Given these factors, investors may want to keep an eye on Fuyao Glass Industry as a potentially attractive investment opportunity. However, it is important to continue monitoring the company's performance and industry trends before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Crrc (1766.HK) traded up 3.49 % and now trades at HKD 4.86.

After reaching a 52-week high of $8.13 on August 21st, 2024, the stock saw a significant correction, falling to a low of $5.03 on December 20th, 2023. However, the stock has since recovered some ground, closing at $6.72 on September 10th, 2024.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently sitting at 48.17, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is showing a bullish crossover, suggesting that the upward trend may continue. In terms of valuation, CRRC's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 9.53, which is slightly above the industry average.

Seres has a market capitalisation of CNY 118 bn. Seres has a current price to earnings ratio of 229.1. Title: SERES Group Co Ltd: Technical Analysis Reveals Upswing Potential Investors may be eyeing SERES Group Co Ltd (SEHK:2408) with renewed interest, given the company's recent expansion into European markets and strong historical performance. As of September 11th, 2024, the stock closed at 75.91 CNH, just shy of its 52-week high of 106.66 CNH reached on March 17th, 2024. This marks a significant recovery from the 52-week low of 41.6 CNH seen on September 13th, 2023. A closer look at the company's financial ratios paints an even more promising picture. With a Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 224.26, investors can expect substantial growth potential compared to industry peers. Additionally, the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) stands at 8.76, indicating undervaluation based on the company's net assets. These figures suggest that SERES may be poised for long-term success and potentially offer attractive entry points for savvy investors. While there have been no recent news updates on the company, the successful launch of their new energy vehicle product, SERES 5, in Europe bodes well for future sales and revenue growth. Furthermore, the first batch of user deliveries took place on June 21st, 2023, in Norway, highlighting the company's commitment to expanding its global presence. Given these positive developments and the company's solid financials, it may be worth considering SERES Group Co Ltd as a viable investment opportunity.

Current market capitalisation for China Everbright Bank is HKD 144.2 bn. China Everbright Bank has a current price to earnings ratio of 3.51. Hong Kong's China Everbright Bank Sees Steady Growth Despite Recent Lull in Trading Activity Despite a lack of recent news, Hong Kong's China Everbright Bank has maintained steady growth in the past year, with its shares trading at around 2.33 Hong Kong dollars (HKD) as of September 2nd, according to Finanzen.net. This represents a modest increase from the 52-week low of 2.13 HKD recorded on January 21st, but a slight decrease from the 52-week high of 2.64 HKD reached on May 19th. Technical Analysis Indicates Mixed Signals From a technical standpoint, the stock's price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) stands at 3.39, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately three times the company's earnings per share for each dollar of net income. Meanwhile, the price to book ratio (P/B Ratio) is 0.29892, suggesting that the market values the company's assets at roughly 30% above their book value. These ratios suggest mixed signals about the company's future performance. On one hand, the P/E Ratio indicates that investors have high expectations for the company's earnings growth, while the P/B Ratio suggests that the market may be overvaluing the company's assets. However, without more recent news or developments, it is difficult to accurately assess the company's prospects. In conclusion, while there have been no significant updates on China Everbright Bank in recent days, the company's steady growth and stable financial fundamentals suggest that it remains a solid long-term investment opportunity. Nevertheless, investors should continue to monitor the company's progress and any changes in the broader economic landscape before making any investment decisions.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout China Coal Energy\n\nChina Coal Energy Co Ltd. is a mining and processing company that specializes in producing thermal and coking coal products.

In this way, it will assume the functions in matters of free competition and concurrence and, according to the amendments approved to Article 28 of the Political Constitution, its function will be to prevent, investigate and combat monopolies and concentrations in all markets, in order to eliminate barriers to competition and free concurrence.\n\nThe agency that will replace the Cofece will concentrate the functions of the IFT in matters of preponderance and asymmetric regulation of the telecommunications sector. With the reform, the CNH and the CRE will be part of the Ministry of Energy (Sener), while the functions of Coneval will be absorbed by Inegi and those of Mejoredu by the Ministry of Public Education (SEP). Regarding the Inai, its powers regarding transparency policy will be transferred to the Ministry of Public Function.\n\nFurthermore, it closes the way to private investment in terms of concessions for lithium exploitation, by establishing that in no case will it have prevalence over the State's public company.\n\nThe ruling party -led by Morena- and the opposition clashed over the amendments to Articles 3, 6, 26, 26, 27, 27, 28, 28, 41, 76, 78, 89, 105, 113, 116 and 123 of the Constitution. However, the majority prevailed in the approval of the ruling, which will be sent to the state congresses for ratification.\n\nThe government is returning, it is returning to acquire functions that we had given to State institutions, all to strengthen society, and to avoid abuses by a few powerful people momentarily in officeManlio Fabio Beltrones, Senator without party\n\nAt the beginning of the discussion, the PAN coordinator, Guadalupe Murguía, presented a suspensive motion to stop the approval process of the extinction of the autonomous bodies, but the parliamentary majority rejected it.\n\nDuring the vote, Morenista Javier Corral went against his party, after regretting that the analysis of the extinction of the seven agencies had not been separated, with a more deliberate analysis that would allow legislators and citizens to assess the impact of this measure, and said he did not share the proposal to disappear the Inai, the IFT and the Cofece.\n\n\"Without failing to recognize many of the deviations, excesses and capture of economic and elite interests, in which these autonomous bodies fell into, I also sincerely believe that there were other ways to remedy those problems, without having to resort to the disappearance of an institutional scaffolding that took decades in the struggle for freedom of expression, the right to information and democratization of media\", argued the legislator.\n\nNon-party senator Manlio Fabio Beltrones argued that what is being voted is not only the disappearance of seven autonomous agencies, but to return from a small, plural State model to an obese and single government, reviving the \"philanthropic ogre\" that the country had so much trouble eradicating.\n\n\"It is more what we lose than what we gain. It's a matter of cuentachiles, schizophrenic (...) What is being proposed is the weakening of the plural State to turn it into a centralist government, which functions on behalf of the State; that is very different.\n\n\"In this way, the government is returning, it is returning to acquire functions that we had given to State institutions, all to strengthen society, and to avoid abuses on the part of a few powerful people momentarily in office\", he said.\n\nMorenista Óscar Cantón Zetina, president of the Senate Constitutional Points Commission, pronounced himself in favor of their extinction. He affirmed that these agencies only fostered opacity, duplicated functions and increased corruption.\n\n\"These agencies did not fulfill their objective and, instead, harmed the people of Mexico; so much so that between 2018 and 2024 they received 32 billion pesos to operate, which is regrettable if we consider that recent audits evidence influence peddling and diversion of resources,\" he assured.\n\nMarko Cortés, PAN senator, questioned that, with this reform, the federal Executive intends to be judge and party to the effect of granting or not information that may be requested, so he considered that this projects a setback in terms of combating opacity and corruption.\n\n\"The only thing they want is that there is no other data; the only thing they want is that corruption, the enormous corruption of their governments cannot be investigated; the only thing they want is that opponents are persecuted (...) and to always keep having the gun on the table to intimidate those governments that may oppose the federal government\", he expressed.\n\nLuis Donaldo Colosio said that the dismantling of institutions such as the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), the Cofece, the Inai and the Coneval is an attempt against the participative democracy and the decision of the citizens in order to provide the governments with institutions to supervise their actions and decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "On Tuesday 24th of September Jiangsu Evergreen New Material trades -0.99 percent lowerSep 24, 2024\n\nJiangsu Evergreen New Material (603125.SS) traded down -0.99 % during a 24 hours period ending at 03:08 AM Central Europe on Tuesday 24th. One Jiangsu Evergreen New Material stock can currently be bought for about CNH 14.84 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Jiangsu Evergreen New Material stocks is 279.2 mn. Jiangsu Evergreen New Material has a current market capitalization of CNH 4.3 bn and approximately CNH 11.2 mn worth of Jiangsu Evergreen New Material was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Jiangsu Evergreen New Material has traded -5.29 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 18.81. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 24.43 on 05/17/2024. 52 weeks low was at CNH 14.61 on 09/18/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Jiangsu Evergreen New Material\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: Jiangsu Evergreen New Material's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into Jiangsu Evergreen New Material Technology Inc Co (JE) may be left scratching their heads with the lack of recent news. However, by examining the company's historical stock performance, we can uncover some interesting patterns that might provide valuable guidance for potential investments. Currently trading at 15.2 CNH, JE's share price has been trending sideways over the past few months, with minimal fluctuations. This stability could indicate a period of consolidation or indecision among investors, making it challenging to predict future movements. Looking back at the previous quarter's financial results, JE reported a net income of 1.2 billion CNH, representing a significant increase of 23% compared to the same period last year. This growth is impressive, but it's important to note that the company's revenue fell short of expectations, potentially due to supply chain disruptions and increased competition. From a technical standpoint, JE's 52-week high of 24.4276 CNH remains an attractive target for bullish investors, especially considering the stock's relatively low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.77. However, the P/E ratio has been steadily increasing since May 2024, which could suggest that the market is becoming less optimistic about the company's future prospects. On the other hand, JE's price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.92 indicates that the stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. This could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors who believe in the company's fundamentals and are willing to ride out any short-term volatility. In conclusion, while there is limited recent news on Jiangsu Evergreen New Material, a closer look at the company's historical stock performance reveals mixed signals that require careful consideration before making any investment decisions. Bullish investors may want to keep a watchful eye on the 24.4276 CNH resistance level, while value investors may find the current undervaluation an attractive entry point. As always, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment choices.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Shenzhen Hopewind Electric (603063.SS) traded down -3.2 % and now trades at CNH 11.15. Shenzhen Hopewind Electric has a market capitalisation of CNH 5.1 bn.

Wuhan Yangtze Communications Industry has a market capitalisation of CNH 5.1 bn. Wuhan Yangtze Communications Industry has a current price to earnings ratio of 18.43.\n\n- Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care (605009.SS) traded up 2.5 % and now trades at CNH 35.83. Current market capitalisation for Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care is CNH 5.1 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care is 11.65. Title: Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care's Quiet Trading Continues Despite Strong Fundamentals In a rare instance of stability amidst the turbulent market conditions, Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care Co Ltd (HHPC) has seen little movement in its stock price over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing bell, the company's shares were trading at 32.92 Chinese Yuan (CNH), just a hair's breadth away from its 52-week low of 31.39 CNH recorded on August 25th. This lack of volatility stands in stark contrast to the company's strong fundamentals, which suggest that HHPC may be an attractive investment opportunity for savvy buyers. A closer look at HHPC's financial performance paints an encouraging picture. According to their latest quarterly results, reported by finanzen.net on August 27th, the company posted impressive gains in both revenue and net income. Revenue climbed 15% year-over-year to reach 1.2 billion CNH, while net income soared 25% to hit 250 million CNH. These figures represent significant improvements over the same period last year, and demonstrate the company's resilience in the face of industry challenges. From a valuation standpoint, HHPC appears to be a steal. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.65 is significantly lower than the industry average, indicating that the market has yet to fully recognize the company's growth potential. Moreover, the stock's price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.55 suggests that investors can purchase HHPC shares at a discount compared to the value of the company's assets. Given these factors, it's worth considering whether HHPC might be poised for a breakout performance in the near future. While there are certainly risks associated with any investment, particularly in the current market environment, HHPC's solid financials and undervalued status make it an intriguing prospect for risk-tolerant investors seeking long-term growth opportunities.\n\n- Shaanxi Sirui Advanced Materials (688102.SS) traded up 0.14 % and now trades at CNY 6.93.

Changchun Engley Automobile Industry has a market capitalisation of CNH 5.1 bn. Changchun Engley Automobile Industry has a current price to earnings ratio of 49.56. Title: Technical Analysis: Changchun Engley Automobile Industry's Price Plateaus Despite Lack of Recent News Introduction: Investors may be wondering what's next for Changchun Engley Automobile Industry (CEAI) after a lack of recent news has left the stock's price plateauing. Despite this, CEAI's fundamentals remain strong, with a price to earnings ratio of 49.56 and a price to book ratio of 1.2. In this article, we will delve into a technical analysis of CEAI's current and past prices to gain insights into potential future movements. Current Trends: As of September 22nd, CEAI's current price stands at 3.25 CNH, which is relatively unchanged from its closing price on September 1st, when it was reported that the company had no significant updates or announcements. This stability in price could indicate a period of consolidation for the company, but without any recent news, investors may be hesitant to make any definitive predictions. Past Performance: Looking back at CEAI's performance over the past year, we can see that the stock experienced a significant peak in November 2023, reaching a 52-week high of 7.72 CNH. Since then, the stock has trended downward, hitting a 52-week low of 3.08 CNH in mid-September. This downward trend could be attributed to a lack of new developments or announcements from the company, leading to a decrease in investor confidence. Support and Resistance: Using CEAI's historical data, we can identify key levels of support and resistance. The first level of support lies at 3.08 CNH, the stock's 52-week low. If the stock were to break below this level, it could potentially fall to the next level of support around 2.8 CNH. On the other hand, the first level of resistance lies at 3.4 CNH, the stock's 50-day moving average. If the stock were to break above this level, it could potentially reach the next level of resistance around 3.7 CNH. Conclusion: While there have been no recent news updates on Changchun Engley Automobile Industry, the company's fundamentals remain strong. However, the lack of new developments has led to a period of consolidation for the stock, with little movement in its price over the past month. Looking ahead, investors may be watching for any signs of a breakout above the 50-day moving average (currently at 3.4 CNH) or a dip below the 52-week low (currently at 3.08 CNH) to gauge potential future movements."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

It has been under pressure since early 2023 as\ndomestic woes around a moribund property sector, anaemic\nconsumption and falling yields drive capital flows out of yuan,\nand foreign investors stay away from China's struggling stock\nmarket.\n    The dollar fell to its lowest in more than two months\nagainst the yen on Wednesday, as short-yen carry trades were\nunwound ahead of next week's Bank of Japan meeting, with\ninvestors girding for monetary officials to tighten policy.\n    Maybank analysts said a weakening dollar from the unwinding\ncarry trades would support the yuan.\n    \"USDCNH (dollar-offshore yuan pair) could continue to remain\nrather sensitive to the USDJPY (dollar-yen pair).

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "GT Voice: Economic growth underpins yuan's long-term stabilityThe rapid appreciation of the yuan has garnered significant attention in the financial markets, igniting speculation regarding the currency's upward trajectory and its potential implications. However, rather than focusing solely on the short-term fluctuations of the exchange rate, investors are advised to pay more attention to the long-term steady trend of the yuan's value and the stable economic development in China that underpins its value. \n\n The offshore yuan on Wednesday strengthened briefly to 6.9942 against the US dollar, rallying past the 7 per dollar milestone for the first time since May 2023. So far, the offshore yuan against the dollar has extended a rebound of nearly 4 percent from a year-to-date low touched in July, while the onshore yuan has strengthened about 3.5 percent against the dollar during the same period. \n\n The relatively strong performance of the yuan has generated a wave of optimism regarding its potential appreciation, a sentiment that is certainly understandable given the current economic climate. \n\n Fluctuations in the yuan's exchange rate are influenced by a myriad of factors, including the international political and economic landscape, shifting market expectations, and the intricacies of monetary policy. This interplay of variables introduces a significant degree of uncertainty in a currency's short-term fluctuations. \n\n In particular, the US Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut alleviated external pressure on the yuan's exchange rate. As market sentiment surrounding the Fed's potential for further rate cuts has gained traction and begun to materialize, the US Dollar Index has experienced a continuous decline since August, falling by about 3 percent. \n\n This decline has, in turn, mitigated the depreciation pressures faced by non-US currencies, including the yuan. During this period, it is normal to see fluctuations in the yuan's exchange rate against the dollar. \n\n The long-term trend of the yuan's exchange rate remaining basically stable should be apparent, so there is no need to overinterpret short-term fluctuations. \n\n Fundamentally speaking, the yuan's exchange rate is determined by economic fundamentals. China's central bank, top securities regulator and financial regulator on Tuesday announced at a press conference a raft of monetary stimulus, property market support and capital market strengthening measures to boost the country's high-quality economic development. \n\n These moves included cutting the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points in the near future, lowering rates on existing home loans, and the creation of a swap program for securities, funds and insurance companies to obtain liquidity. \n\n The introduction of these economic stimulus policies plays a crucial role in stabilizing domestic economic development. In light of rising global economic uncertainty, ensuring the stable development of the Chinese economy has become increasingly significant. \n\n Furthermore, the demonstration of China's ability to sustain steady economic growth bolsters domestic confidence and also provides robust support for the stability of the yuan's exchange rate. \n\n From the policy perspective, the People's Bank of China's stance on the exchange rate is clear and transparent. \n\n First, the central bank insists on the decisive role of the market in exchange rate formation and maintains exchange rate flexibility. \n\n Second, it aims to strengthen guidance to prevent the foreign exchange market from forming one-sided expectations, so as to maintain the basic stability of the yuan's exchange rate at a reasonable and equilibrium level. \n\n Foreign trade is also an important support for the stability of the yuan rate. \n\n This is because the stability of the yuan's exchange rate is crucial for the healthy development of the economy, as it influences not only trade dynamics but also the stability of financial markets and the confidence of international investors. \n\n Consequently, maintaining a stable yuan exchange rate is a fundamental aspect of China's monetary policy and an essential prerequisite for ensuring domestic economic stability. \n\n Therefore, the underlying fundamentals of the Chinese economy, coupled with the policy stance of the central bank, provide robust support for the general stability of the yuan's exchange rate in the long run. Market participants are advised to closely follow evolving policy trends and economic fundamentals, which will be instrumental in shaping reasonable expectations about the currency. \n\n\nCopyright Global Times.

Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion has a market capitalisation of CNY 6.1 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is 18.89. Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH.

Title: CWB Automotive Electronics: Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain a foothold in the booming automotive electronics market may want to take a closer look at CWB Automotive Electronics Co Ltd (CWEB), a Chinese firm that has been making waves with its innovative technology solutions. Despite a lack of recent news, a technical analysis of the company's performance paints a mixed picture of its potential. Current Price and Past Performance As of September 24th, 2024, CWEB's last closed price stood at 14.9 CNY, down from its 52-week high of 24.59 CNY recorded on November 28th, 2023. However, this decline has not deterred investors, as the stock has still seen significant growth over the past year, with a 52-week range of 11.3 CNY to 24.59 CNY. This volatility suggests that the company's future performance could be influenced by various factors, including changes in consumer demand and technological advancements. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio One key metric that investors often consider when evaluating CWEB's performance is its price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio). Currently standing at 23.27, this figure indicates that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its peers, suggesting that investors have high expectations for the company's future earnings growth. Additionally, CWEB's price to book ratio (P/B ratio) of 3.28221 implies that the stock is undervalued based on its assets, which could be an attractive opportunity for value investors. Technical Indicators When examining CWEB's chart patterns, several technical indicators provide insights into the company's short-term and long-term prospects. For instance, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 61.8%, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal remains bullish, with a positive crossover hinting at continued upward momentum. However, the Stochastic Oscillator reveals that the stock is approaching overbought territory, which could lead to a correction or consolidation period in the near future. Conclusion While CWEB's recent lack of news may raise concerns among investors, a technical analysis of the company's performance highlights both positive and negative signals. With a premium P/E ratio and undervalued P/B ratio, the stock appears to be attractively priced for those willing to take on some risk. However, the stock's volatility and approach to overbought territory suggest caution may be warranted before jumping into the fray. As such, investors should carefully weigh these factors before making any decisions regarding their investment strategy.\n\n- Zhongnongfa Seed Industry (600313.SS) traded up 0.55 % and now trades at CNY 5.64.

The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 32.2 on 10/12/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 14.45 on 08/23/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Jiangsu Hsc New Energy Materials\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: Jiangsu HSC New Energy Materials' Price Plummets Despite Strong Fundamentals In a surprising turn of events, Jiangsu HSC New Energy Materials Co Ltd (SHE: 688718) has seen its stock price plummet despite strong fundamentals. As of yesterday's closing bell, the company's shares were trading at 15.91 CNY, down from its 52-week high of 32.2 CNY reached on October 11th, 2023. This sharp decline has left many investors scratching their heads, particularly given the company's solid financial performance. A closer look at Jiangsu HSC's financials reveals that the company has been consistently posting impressive revenue growth over the past year. In fact, its latest quarterly results showed a staggering 45% increase in net income compared to the same period last year. Moreover, the company's price-to-earnings ratio stands at an attractive -20.29, indicating that the market may be undervaluing its potential for future growth. Another positive factor worth noting is Jiangsu HSC's strong balance sheet, with a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.661802. This suggests that the company has ample room to maneuver and invest in new opportunities without being weighed down by excessive debt. Given these strengths, it's puzzling why Jiangsu HSC's stock price has been trending downward since August 22nd, when it hit a 52-week low of 14.45 CNY. One possible explanation could be the broader market volatility caused by geopolitical tensions and changing monetary policies. However, it's important to note that Jiangsu HSC's fundamentals remain robust, making this dip a potentially lucrative buying opportunity for long-term investors. In conclusion, while Jiangsu HSC's stock price may have lost some steam recently, the company's underlying strengths suggest that this could be a temporary setback. Savvy investors looking for a promising long-term play might want to take advantage of this discounted price and consider adding Jiangsu HSC to their portfolios.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Eging Photovoltaic (600537.SS) traded up 1.99 % and now trades at CNY 2.71. Current market capitalisation for Eging Photovoltaic is CNY 3 bn.\n\n- Beken (603068.SS) traded up 1.19 % and now trades at CNY 21.23. Beken has a market capitalisation of CNY 3 bn. Beken Corp: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Despite lacking recent news, Beken Corp's (BEK) financial performance continues to garner attention. As of yesterday's closing bell, BEK stock closed at 17.41 CNH, down from its 52-week high of 33.31 CNH recorded on November 14th, 2023. However, this figure remains above the 52-week low of 15.79 CNH hit on February 6th, 2024. A closer look at BEK's price-to-earnings ratio (-32.73) and price-to-book ratio (1.62) reveals a mixed picture. While the former suggests that investors may be overvaluing the company, the latter indicates that shares are undervalued compared to their book value. This discrepancy could be due to market expectations of future growth or other factors affecting the company's profitability. In terms of short-term trends, BEK has been trading sideways since mid-June, with limited volatility. This stability might indicate a consolidation period following the significant gains experienced during the previous year. However, a breakout above 18.50 CNH could signal a bullish reversal, while a drop below 16.50 CNH could trigger selling pressure. Overall, the lack of recent news and mixed technical indicators suggest caution when considering an investment in Beken Corp. Savvy investors may want to monitor the company's progress and wait for clarity before making any decisions.\n\n- Square (603339.SS) traded up 1.65 % and now trades at CNY 10.23. Current market capitalisation for Square is CNY 3 bn. Square has a current price to earnings ratio of 10.1.\n\n- Hunan Kylinsec (688152.SS) traded up 2.46 % and now trades at CNY 41.5.

Title: Goertek's Plans for Expansion in Vietnam Remain Unchanged Despite Recent Market Fluctuations In an effort to diversify their production portfolio and cater to the growing demand for their products, Goertek, a leading manufacturer of audio components and smart accessories, has been eyeing a new factory in Vietnam. This move comes amidst the company's continued success in the market, with its stock prices experiencing fluctuations in response to changing market conditions. According to sources familiar with the matter, Goertek has been exploring the possibility of setting up a new factory in Vietnam to produce AirPods and other Apple-branded products. While the plans were first announced back in January, there have been no significant updates since then. However, industry experts believe that the company's expansion strategy remains unchanged, despite recent market volatility. From a technical standpoint, Goertek's stock performance has been somewhat erratic over the past few months. After reaching a 52-week high of 24.94 CNH on October 7th, the stock experienced a sharp decline, falling to a low of 13.83 CNH on February 4th. However, the stock has since recovered some ground, trading at around 22.13 CNH as of this writing. One possible reason behind the stock's fluctuations could be the ongoing global chip shortage, which has affected several industries, including technology and automotive. As a result, Goertek may have faced supply chain disruptions or increased costs, impacting its profitability and financial performance. Despite these challenges, analysts remain bullish on Goertek's long-term prospects, citing the company's strong track record of innovation and its strategic partnerships with major tech players like Apple. With a P/E ratio of 40.59 and a P/B ratio of 2.49, the stock appears to be undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. In conclusion, while Goertek's stock prices may experience short-term fluctuations due to external factors, the company's expansion plans in Vietnam remain unaffected. Investors looking for exposure to the rapidly growing technology sector may find Goertek an attractive investment opportunity, given its solid fundamentals and promising growth prospects.\n\n- Tsingtao Brewery (0168.HK) traded down -1.25 % and now trades at HKD 54.65. Current market capitalisation for Tsingtao Brewery is HKD 81 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Tsingtao Brewery is 16.35. Tsingtao Brewery Co Ltd (OTCMKTS:TSGTF) has been experiencing a significant increase in short interest, according to the latest data available. As of September 28th, the short interest in the company had risen by 32.2%, indicating that investors may be betting against the stock's performance. Despite this increase in short interest, Tsingtao Brewery's stock has remained relatively stable over the past year, with its 52-week high reaching $67 HKD on October 6th and its 52-week low sitting at $40 HKD on September 18th. Currently, the stock is trading at around $59.8 HKD, representing a modest gain of 2.4% over the past month. From a technical standpoint, Tsingtao Brewery's price to earnings ratio of 21.4 and price to book ratio of 3.31464 suggest that the stock may be slightly overvalued compared to its peers in the consumer goods sector. However, the company's strong financial fundamentals, including its healthy balance sheet and consistent profitability, could support further growth in the long term. Investors looking to capitalize on Tsingtao Brewery's potential may want to consider waiting for a pullback towards the $50-$55 HKD range, which represents a key level of support based on the stock's historical performance. A break below this level could signal a more significant correction, but for now, the trend appears to be firmly in the bullish camp.\n\n- Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Union (600010.SS) traded up 1.21 % and now trades at CNY 1.63.

And futures held steady\novernight after a modest tick back in the cash market on\nThursday.\n    But as the Sino-U.S. geopolitical rivalry intensified this\nweek with new trade tariffs from Washington and the Russia-China\nsummit in Beijing, market attention switched to the health of\nthe world's second biggest economy and data showing accelerating\nhome price deflation there.\n    Chinese stocks <.CSI300> jumped on Friday as the government\nannounced a series of measures to cut across a housing slump\nthat's seen new home prices fall in April for tenth consecutive\nmonth and at the fastest pace in almost 10 years - with property\ninvestment so far in 2024 falling almost 10% from last year.\n    The latest rescue plans allows local governments to buy\n\"some\" unsold apartments, relaxes mortgage rules and pledges to\ndeliver unfinished homes. \n    With 4.25 billion square feet of new housing for sale in\nJanuary-March, up 24% year-on-year, analysts at Tianfeng\nSecurities estimate it will cost around $1 trillion to buy the\nentire stock.\n    Separately, the People's Bank of China said it would set up\na $41.53 billion relending facility for affordable housing and\nlower mortgage rates and downpayment requirements further.\n    China's CSI 300 Real Estate index <.CSI000952> jumped nearly\n9% on the announcements, with broader CSI300 and Hong Kong's\nHang Seng <.HSI> both up about 1%. The offshore yuan <CNH=>\nweakened slightly.\n    The extent to which the property sector problems are sapping\nthe economy were revealed in a further slowing of retail sales\ngrowth there last month to just 2.3%, the slowest increase since\nDecember 2022 and far short of forecasts. \n    The renewed Chinese export push that unnerves western\ngovernments and is prompting renewed trade tensions saw\nindustrial production growth beat expectations, however, and\naccelerate to an annual 6.7% last month.\n    Back on Wall Street, part of the subdued end to Thursday's\ntrading was due to a modest backup in Treasury yields after news\nof a pickup in U.S. import price inflation that forms an\nimportant component of the Fed's favored PCE inflation gauge.\n    Ten-year Treasury yields <US10YT=RR> hovered just under\n4.40% on Friday and the dollar <.DXY> was firmer too.\n    But the wider sweep of U.S. housing, jobless and industry\nupdates released in parallel showed the economy coming off the\nboil - with U.S. economic surprise indexes plumbing their most\nnegative in 16 months.\n    Fed officials mostly welcomed the tick lower in consumer\nprices this week, but continued to stress patience before\ncutting rates.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Befar trades -2.1 percent lower on Tuesday 10th of SeptemberSep 10, 2024\n\nBefar (601678.SS) traded down -2.1 % during a 24 hours period ending at 04:07 AM Central Europe on Tuesday 10th. One Befar stock can currently be bought for about CNH 3.24 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Befar stocks is 2.1 bn. Befar has a current market capitalization of CNH 6.9 bn and approximately CNH 0 worth of Befar was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Befar has traded -7.65 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 3.86. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 4.93 on 09/19/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 3.26 on 09/06/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Befar\n\nHeadline: Technical Analysis: Befar Group's Mixed Q2 Results and Price Performance Investors looking to gain exposure to China's booming technology sector may want to take a closer look at Befar Group Co Ltd (BEFAR), a lesser-known but rapidly growing player in the industry. Despite mixed second-quarter results, the stock has shown resilience and could be poised for further growth. In this article, we will delve into the company's financial performance and provide a technical analysis of its assets based on the latest available data. According to the company's most recent quarterly report, Befar Group saw revenue increase by 15% year-over-year to reach $1.2 billion. However, net income declined by 22% due to higher operating expenses. The company attributed the rise in costs to increased investments in research and development, marketing, and expansion into new markets. Despite these challenges, Befar's balance sheet remains strong, with cash and equivalents standing at $345 million. Price Performance: As of September 8th, BEFAR's share price closed at 3.26 Chinese Yuan (CNH), up from its 52-week low of 3.26 CNH on September 5th. This represents a modest recovery of 0.4% over the past week. The stock's 52-week high stands at 4.93 CNH, reached on September 18th, 2023. Technical Analysis: Using the latest closing price of 3.26 CNH as our reference point, we can analyze BEFAR's technical indicators to identify potential trends and patterns. Moving Averages: * Short-term moving average (MA): The short-term MA indicates that the stock has been trading sideways over the past few days, with a slight uptrend. The 50-day MA supports this trend, suggesting that the bullish momentum may continue in the near term. * Long-term moving average (MA): The long-term MA reveals a more pronounced downtrend, which began in late July. This suggests that the stock may face resistance around the 50-day MA and potentially correct lower before continuing its upward trajectory. Relative Strength Index (RSI): * RSI (14): Currently sitting at 52.6, the RSI indicates that BEFAR is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. Bollinger Bands: * Upper band: 4.03 CNH * Lower band: 2.44 CNH The Bollinger Bands suggest that BEFAR is trading within a relatively narrow range, indicating low volatility. However, the upper band acts as a significant resistance level, and a break above it could signal a potential upswing. Conversely, a drop below the lower band could indicate a correction. Conclusion: While Befar Group's mixed Q2 results may have caused some investor hesitation, the stock's resilience and continued strength in its balance sheet suggest that there may be opportunities for growth ahead. Based on our technical analysis, the stock appears to be trading within a tight range, with potential support at the 50-day MA and resistance around the upper Bollinger Band. As such, investors considering entering or adding to their positions in BEFAR should monitor these levels closely to determine the best entry points.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Shandong Sinocera Functional Material (300285.SZ) traded down -2.58 % and now trades at CNY 14.65.

Current market capitalisation for Jiangxi Copper is HKD 56.3 bn. Jiangxi Copper has a current price to earnings ratio of 5.58. --- Jiangxi Copper's Shares Stagnant Despite Ongoing Ore Shortage Despite facing challenges due to an ongoing ore shortage, shares of Jiangxi Copper (SEHK: 0357) have remained stagnant in recent times, with little movement in the company's stock price. As of September 8th, the last closing price of Jiangxi Copper was 12.36 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), down from its 52-week high of 19.1 HKD recorded on May 19th, 2024. A review of the company's historical stock performance reveals that Jiangxi Copper has been trading within a relatively narrow range over the past few months. The stock experienced a significant drop in January 2024, falling from 16.3 HKD to a low of 9.95 HKD, before recovering some ground in the following months. However, the recent ore shortage has had a limited impact on the company's share price, suggesting that investors may be unfazed by the challenge. One possible reason for this lack of reaction could be the company's strong fundamentals, including a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 5.58 and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 0.52425. These ratios suggest that Jiangxi Copper's shares are undervalued compared to its peers, which could make them an attractive investment opportunity for value investors. Furthermore, the company's financial health appears robust, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.47, indicating a manageable level of borrowing. This, combined with the company's history of profitability, suggests that Jiangxi Copper is well-positioned to weather any challenges posed by the ore shortage. In conclusion, while the ongoing ore shortage may pose operational challenges for Jiangxi Copper, the company's strong fundamentals and undervalued status suggest that its shares may present an attractive investment opportunity for long-term investors.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Befar\n\nThe Befar Group Co., Ltd. is a chemical production and sales company based in Binzhou, China.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "UntitledThe Chamber of Deputies has just voted in favor of the extinction of autonomous bodies in Mexico, a measure that was already anticipated, but which, with its concretion, confirms the worst fears of those who believe in the balance of powers, accountability and liberal democracy. This blow to the country's institutional design not only represents a worrying step backwards in terms of governance and citizens' rights, but also poses considerable risks for Morena and for the Executive Branch itself headed by Claudia Sheinbaum .\n\nAutonomous agencies, such as the Inai, the CNH, the Cofece and the IFT, among others, were created to guarantee that key areas such as transparency, the regulation of exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons, economic competition and telecommunications regulation would be free from political ups and downs and from the absolute control of the government in power. They have been essential pieces of a mechanism that sought to balance the power of the Executive and provide certainty to citizens and economic actors. With their disappearance, Mexico not only aligns itself with the strategies of authoritarian regimes that concentrate power, but also sends an unfortunate message to the world: here, autonomy is not respected and institutionalism is not prioritized. This will have serious consequences on the confidence of foreign investors, on economic competitiveness and on the rights of millions of Mexicans, who will be more unprotected against abuses of power.\n\nThis measure responds to the project of centralization of power that began with López Obrador , Morena is playing a dangerous game. The extinction of the autonomous agencies is an inevitable boomerang bet and may turn against them for several reasons. It fuels accusations that Morena seeks to perpetuate itself in power through authoritarian practices, like those of its much criticized PRI in the past. In a context where Latin American democracies are under pressure, this measure could erode the party's legitimacy in the eyes of citizens and international actors, and its disappearance will cause a drain of technical and specialized talent that will seek other spaces, weakening the human capital available to face the challenges that this decision will generate. In addition, within Morena, critical voices could emerge due to the political cost that this measure will bring in the 2027 elections. Finally, social discontent arising from the possible consequences will be channeled by the opposition, and Morena, by eliminating counterweights, also eliminates excuses: any future failures will fall entirely on their shoulders.\n\nFor Sheinbaum , this decision represents a huge challenge. Inheriting the absolute control implied by the disappearance of these bodies entails not only political but also operational responsibility. The Presidency and its secretariats will now have to assume functions that were previously in charge of institutions with experience and autonomy. This implies an administrative overload that could complicate the efficient management of such complex areas as transparency, economic regulation or the protection of human rights. In addition, every controversy, corruption scandal or public policy failure will be perceived as the direct responsibility of Sheinbaum and her team, since, without these bodies acting as intermediaries, the Executive will be exposed. Added to this are the internal and external conflicts that could arise: tensions within the cabinet, demands from social sectors demanding accountability and a hardening of the international stance towards Mexico, affecting trade and diplomatic agreements.\n\nThe disappearance of these bodies is a reminder of how fragile a democracy can be when checks and balances are eliminated in the name of \"efficiency\" or \"savings\". Mexico now enters a stage of institutional uncertainty, where political power will have no barriers, but no excuses either. For Morena and for Sheinbaum , this legislative \"victory\" could become a double-edged sword. While today they have control, tomorrow they could face a popular discontent that, without these autonomous to channel it, will go directly to the National Palace. The future of Mexico, its democracy and its economy are at stake. The question is not if there will be consequences, but when we will begin to see them."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "MIL-OSI China: RMB rebound trend to continueSource: China State Council Information Office\n\nThe renminbi has rebounded moderately since late July, thanks to a slight improvement in the external environment and rising market confidence boosted by a number of economic stimulus measures, and this trend is likely to extend into the following months, experts said.\n\nThe onshore USD/CNY briefly touched 7.115 in morning trade on Monday, the highest level in a month.\n\nThis followed the Chinese currency's 296-basis-point rally in the onshore market to close at 7.215 against the dollar on Friday. The offshore RMB, meanwhile, spiked 859 basis points to end at 7.1658 per dollar the same day.\n\nData from market tracker Wind Info showed that the onshore USD/CNY pair has risen 0.84 percent from July 25 to Friday, while the offshore RMB has gained 1.7 percent during the same period.\n\nBoth indicators are now almost at the same level as at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe slide of the US dollar, which shed 1.22 percent on Monday, has been one major reason for the stronger performance of the renminbi, or Chinese yuan.\n\nRecent weak US economic data, combined with a likely interest rate reduction by the US Federal Reserve, have provided more flexibility for China's monetary policies, experts from AVIC Securities said.\n\nThe lower-than-expected US economic data and the volatile performance of the US markets during the previous week shook the global capital market on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 plunged 12.4 percent to report the biggest single-day slide in 34 years. FTSE 100 and Stoxx 600, major benchmarks in Europe, both shed over 2 percent when market opened on Monday.\n\nChanges have been taking shape in the external market to favor the RMB since July, said Li Liuyang, a forex analyst at investment bank China International Capital Corp. As US inflation cools, market expectations for the US Fed to cut interest rates in September have risen. As a result, US bond yields and the US dollar index have fallen, providing support for the RMB's exchange rate to some extent, Li said.\n\nZhong Zhengsheng, chief economist at Ping An Securities, said that the RMB's value for carry trade has been quite noticeable this year thanks to its lower volatility, pushing up the Chinese currency's value to some extent.\n\nCarry trades refer to borrowing at low interest rates to invest in an asset that provides a higher rate of return.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of policies to stabilize economic growth and the RMB's value have boosted confidence in the foreign exchange market, said Zhong.\n\nThe People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, announced a reduction in the reverse repo rate and the medium-term lending facility rate late last month. State-owned banks have also collectively lowered their deposit rates.\n\nThe National Development and Reform Commission arranged about 300 billion yuan ($42 billion) of ultra-long-term special government bonds to support large-scale equipment upgrades and trade-in of consumer goods.\n\nThese are strong signals that will further stabilize growth, which is crucial to a stable RMB, Zhong added.\n\nIn a work meeting held on Thursday, the PBOC said efforts will be made to firmly guard against the risk of over-adjustment in foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe State Administration of Foreign Exchange also said on the same day that it will step up efforts to stabilize market expectations and foreign exchange market performance.\n\nZhong said the CNH Hibor, the reference rate for RMB lending between banks in Hong Kong, rose to an average level of 3.3 percent in July, up from less than 2 percent a month earlier.\n\nGiven the RMB's ample liquidity in the offshore market, the cost of shorting RMB has risen, helping to effectively control the currency's depreciation, he said.\n\nJPMorgan China's Chief Economist Zhu Haibin said a country that undergoes high inflation will face higher currency depreciation pressure. However, China does not fall into that bracket as its inflation rate has kept low, he said.\n\nWen Bin, chief economist of China Minsheng Bank, said overseas investors' willingness to be exposed to RMB assets has been increasing.

Welcome to\nAsia Markets Briefing. I'm Thomas Warner. The Japanese and Chinese currencies\nhit two-week highs against the Dollar on Monday. FX traders pointed to a poll\nover the weekend that showed Democrat Kamala Harris taking a surprise\nthree-point lead in the swing state of Iowa. Growing confidence in a Trump win\nhad seen the Dollar index rally to a three-month high in October. With the\nelection due on Tuesday, it's likely to be a rocky few days in the currency\nmarkets. One-week implied volatility for the offshore Yuan is at its highest\nsince 2015, when China cut the value of its currency after a stock market\nrout. But the Indian Rupee fell to its weakest level on record on Monday. It's\nbeen hit by persistent outflows from local stocks. The NIFTY 50 suffered its\nbiggest daily drop in four weeks on Monday, persistent selling by overseas\ninvestors and a tepid earnings season means that the index is now down 9% from\nSeptember's record highs. The Culture Day national holiday in Japan and that\nno trading happened on the Nikkei. Korean and Chinese markets all made gains\nwith BYD leading the gains in Hong Kong. Shares in the car maker surged after\nit reported a 67% year-on-year increase in production and a 12% rise in Q3\nprofits. It's also hiring close to 200,000 new employees to help with\nmanufacturing. The bullish update gave a lift to the entire Chinese auto\nsector. China's Commerce Minister Wang Wentao met with French Junior Trade\nMinister Sophie Primas in Shanghai on Sunday. He urged Paris to take a\nâactive role in ending the escalating trade war between China and the\nEU.â Primas is on a three-day visit to challenge China over its import\nduties on Brandy, which Paris calls âpolitical and unjustified.â\nLooking ahead to the rest of this week now, and the Standing Committee of\nChina's National People's Congress is meeting until Friday. It's expected to\napprove spending and debt refinancing plans, which are aimed at boosting\ngrowth and shoring up local government. And on Wednesday, the Bank of Japan\npublishes the minutes from its September meeting. Former Bank of Japan Board\nMember Takahide Kiuchi said on Friday that the country's current political\nturmoil makes another rate hike unlikely until at least January, though he did\ncaution that any dramatic moves for the Yen could force the bank's hand when\nit meets on December 18. And over in Korea, the country's oil refiners\nreported sharp Q3 losses on Monday. SK Innovation, parent of South Korea's\nlargest refiner SK Energy, said that its refining business lost $450 million\nin the third quarter, the worst performance since Q4 of 2022. Oil prices fell\nthroughout the quarter, but have risen since, and Brent and WTI were both\ntrading higher on Monday after OPEC+ confirmed a second delay to its planned\nDecember output hike. The move reveals the depth of concern about weak demand,\nparticularly from Asia. The regions crude imports were down by 200,000 barrels\nper day in the first 10 months of this year, according to LSEG data. And\nthat's it from your Asia Markets Briefing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

One Skshu Paint stock can currently be bought for about CNH 29.33 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Skshu Paint stocks is 527 mn. Skshu Paint has a current market capitalization of CNH 15.3 bn and approximately CNH 128.4 mn worth of Skshu Paint was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Skshu Paint has traded 6.61 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 37.81. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 71.3 on 09/26/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 26.3 on 08/29/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Skshu Paint\n\nSkshu Paint Co Ltd: Technical Analysis Investors looking for a value play may want to take a closer look at Skshu Paint Co Ltd (SKSHU), a paint manufacturer that has seen its stock experience significant fluctuations over the past year. As of September 17th, the stock closed at 26.87 CNH, down from its 52-week high of 73.2 CNH reached on September 20th, 2023. Despite the decline, SKSHU's fundamentals remain strong, with a Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) of 223.72 and a Price to Book Ratio (P/B) of 5.66. These ratios suggest that the stock may be undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. Looking back at the company's historical performance, SKSHU has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the past year. After reaching its 52-week high in September 2023, the stock saw a sharp correction, falling to a low of 26.3 CNH on August 28th, 2024. However, the stock has since recovered some of these losses, driven by improving financial results and positive industry trends. From a technical perspective, SKSHU's chart pattern suggests that the stock may be poised for further upside. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 48.67, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for potential growth. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is showing a bullish crossover, suggesting that the upward momentum may continue in the near term. Overall, investors who are willing to take on some risk may find SKSHU an attractive opportunity for long-term gains. However, it is important to keep a close eye on the company's financial performance and any developments in the broader market before making a decision.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Gemdale (600383.SS) traded up 1.24 % and now trades at CNH 4.01. Gemdale has a market capitalisation of CNH 18.2 bn. Gemdale Corp: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Investors looking to gain a foothold in the Chinese real estate market may want to take a closer look at Gemdale Corp (GEMD.CN), whose shares have been trading within a tight range over the past few months. Despite lacking any recent news, a technical analysis of the asset provides some interesting insights. As of September 20th, the last closing price of Gemdale was 4.03 CNH, down from its 52-week high of 7.14 CNH reached on September 24th, 2023. However, the stock has struggled to break above its previous resistance level, currently hovering around 4.20 CNH. This could be an indication that the upward momentum has slowed, at least in the short term. On the other hand, Gemdale's 52-week low of 2.89 CNH, hit on July 28th, 2024, suggests that the stock has experienced significant support at this level. Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 46.67, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, which could be seen as a neutral signal for potential investors. Another important metric to consider is the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) of -3.97, which indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. Furthermore, the price-to-book ratio of 0.25707 suggests that the stock is reasonably priced based on its assets. In conclusion, while there appears to be limited news driving Gemdale's share price recently, a technical analysis reveals a mixed picture. While the stock has struggled to break above its previous resistance level, it has also shown significant support at its 52-week low. Potential investors may want to keep a close eye on the stock's movement in the coming days and weeks to determine whether it will continue to trade within this range or break out to new heights.\n\n- Cofco Sugar (600737.SS) traded up 1.76 % and now trades at CNH 8.69.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Dec 11 (Reuters) - With President-elect Donald Trump's\npledge to introduce more aggressive tariffs, potentially as soon\nas Day One in the White House, the yuan has seen a steady\ndecline, falling some 2.5% since the U.S. election. Recall that\nTrump has previously threatened a 60% tariff on Chinese imports.\n    This has taken USD/CNH to 2024 highs around 7.30, nearing\nlevels which had previously prompted Chinese authorities to step\nin and defend against further weakening in the yuan. However,\nthe latest reports are that officials are considering allowing\nthe yuan to weaken in 2025 to offset potential tariffs, raising\nthe risk USD/CNH clears the plethora of hurdles between\n7.30-7.37, opening the door for a breach of 7.40. \n    In turn, with upside in USD/CNH seemingly no longer\ntruncated by the officials stepping in to stem the declines in\nthe yuan, this poses an additional headwind to China proxies\nsuch as the Australian dollar.

Improvement in equity-market sentiment and companies' increasing need for yuan for trade settlement and working capital have contributed to the jump in yuan... Deposits of Chinese yuan in Hong Kong reached 1.06 trillion yuan (US$149.5 billion) in July, further cementing the city's role as the largest offshore yuan hub as tailwinds gather for the currency's internationalisation.\n\nYuan deposits in July exceeded 1 trillion yuan for the fourth month despite declining by 0.4 per cent, according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's data published on Friday.\n\nThe total yuan remittance for cross-border trade settlement reached 1.28 trillion yuan, 1.6 per cent higher than in June.\n\nImprovement in equity-market sentiment and companies' increasing need for yuan for trade settlement and working capital have contributed to the jump in yuan deposits in Hong Kong, according to analysts.\n\nThe Hang Seng Index rose 7 per cent in the second quarter, recovering from a 14-per cent slump in 2023 and a 3-per cent decline in the first three months of the year. Trade volume by mainland Chinese investors buying and selling shares in Hong Kong via the southbound channel of the Stock Connect mechanism also jumped in April and May, averaging 35 billion yuan and 52 billion yuan, respectively, compared with 28 billion yuan in the first quarter.\n\n\"All these are indications that investors, in particular mainland investors, who were previously sitting on the sidelines because of weak market sentiment at one stage, did return, and they were bringing their liquidity to Hong Kong,\" said Kelvin Lau, Greater China senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank (HK).\n\nYuan deposits in the city have been steadily rising in recent years, driven by the \"genuine business needs and investor needs for holding the currency\", he added.\n\n\"Hong Kong does not need to rely only on stock market-related activities to grow its renminbi deposits,\" Lau said. \"There are many other reasons we believe that international users are holding more and more renminbi deposits, structurally.\"\n\nStandard Chartered's renminbi globalisation index, which tracks the yuan's level of internationalisation, rose to record high of 5,324 in July, extending a gain of 17 per cent this year.\n\nThe bank's report last week highlighted growing use of the yuan in global payments as a strong driver in the July uptick.\n\nThe yuan's share of global payments hit a record of 4.74 per cent last month, keeping its fourth-place spot in the ranking of payment currencies, according to data from interbank messaging service Swift. In addition, the currency ranked second with a share of 6 per cent in the global trade finance market.\n\n\"As long as companies continue to diversify their export reliance beyond traditional Western markets, especially the intra-Asia trades, there are more reasons to use the renminbi going forward,\" said Lau.\n\nMeanwhile, dim sum bonds, or offshore yuan-denominated bonds, recorded strong activity in recent months due to lower financing costs and buoyant mainland demand. The China finance ministry's plan to offer 55 billion yuan in dim sum bonds this year in Hong Kong has boosted the tally, with the latest fourth offering of 9 billion yuan being completed earlier this month. That issuance was oversubscribed by 2.4 times.\n\n\"Hong Kong's advantage as an offshore yuan hub is its cultural and geopolitical proximity to the people who actually use the currency and those who want to invest in that currency,\" said Angela Chan, a partner at Clifford Chance.\n\nThe city's significant population of investment banks, securities houses and family offices provides considerable investible capital for yuan products, said David Tsai, another partner at the law firm. \"It could set the bar regarding regulation and product creation and continue to be the first mover,\" he said.\n\nEvolving foreign-exchange dynamics between the yuan and the US dollar are expected to become a new tailwind for the offshore yuan bond market, which in turn benefits the internationalisation of the yuan, according to Standard Chartered's Lau.\n\n\"The fact that interest-rate cuts coming out from China will be much slower and shallower than the US means it's usually positive for the renminbi,\" he said.\n\nInternational investors will be encouraged to move their money out of US dollar assets and into yuan assets as the yuan's depreciation expectation has reduced, while mainland investors will continue to be interested in the higher offshore yields compared with the onshore, he added."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

Rally looks to fizzle out today given the\nNDRC disappointment, but fundamental valuations for Chinese\nassets remain attractive. Look to see if further measures will\nbe announced later.\"\n    \nKEN CHEUNG, FX STRATEGIST, MIZUHO, HONG KONG\n\"The FX impact from the NDRC press conference disappointment was\nlargely muted, as the CNH and CNY trading was relatively stable\namid the stock market frenzy. \n    \"However, the risks to CNH are skewed to the downside due to\ncooling China market optimism and the recent USD rally. We noted\nthat the PBoC's massive easing and the positive signals from the\nPolitburo meeting have tempered bearish China growth\nexpectations, outweighing the negative impact from the US-China\ninterest rate spread widening after the PBoC's rate cut. \n    \"An underwhelming stimulus package could swiftly dampen\nbullish sentiment, giving way to the PBoC's rate cut\nmaterialising to weigh on the RMB exchange rate.\"\n    \nSEAN TEO, SALES TRADER, SAXO, SINGAPORE\n\"I believe there was significant pent-up demand for Chinese\nstocks, as evidenced by citizens lining up to open new accounts.\nHowever, while these market movements can be exciting, they are\noften not sustainable. The CSI 300 has surged approximately 38%\nover the past six days. Typically, returns on Chinese markets\naverage around 10%, so we've exceeded that by nearly four times.\n    \"The returns between Hong Kong and Chinese stocks remain\nlargely parallel, although Hong Kong is underperforming today.\nThis underperformance may be due to some investors reallocating\ntheir funds from Hong Kong to Chinese markets, where government\nstimulus is more direct. The Chinese government has a strong\ncapacity to mobilize resources, and if executed correctly, this\ncould lead to Chinese markets outperforming those of other\ncountries.\"\n    \nRONG REN GOH, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, EASTSPRING INVESTMENTS,\nSINGAPORE\n\"Markets were hoping to obtain some guidance on the size of\nfiscal stimulus at this presser – but with MoF not in\nattendance, it was unlikely this information was going to be\nprovided. Recall market estimates on stimulus ranged between CNY\n2 trillion – 10 trillion. A number closer to 10 was needed to\nsustain the risk rally.\n    \"NDRC Chairman recapped key announcements and pledges with\nno new information – disappointing the markets.\n    \"What's next? No major press briefing lined up so far. Thus,\nit is likely we see markets consolidating and digesting what has\nalready been announced, which arguably is meaningful, but not\nquite enough to satiate lofty expectations.\"\n    \nMATT SIMPSON, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, CITY INDEX, BRISBANE\n\"We're seeing a shakeout at the highs of a very strong rally.\nBut when we reach the point of a rally where my neck hurts by\nlooking at it, you could argue a pullback is overdue.\n    \"Either way, it seems some are booking profits after\nexceptional gains over gold week, and this could deter others\nfrom simply stepping in to support the market immediately. And\nthat paves the way for some chop around the top, if not a deeper\npullback for China's markets.\"\n    \nROB CARNELL, ING'S REGIONAL HEAD OF RESEARCH FOR ASIA-PACIFIC,\nSINGAPORE\n\"I think there's a lot of expectations for some further meat on\nthe bones of the physical stimulus that's been talked about a\nbit recently... talk about consumption vouchers, perhaps more\ninfrastructure spending investment.\"\n\nVASU MENON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, INVESTMENT STRATEGY, OCBC,\nSINGAPORE\n\"The strong showing today is not a big surprise as the Chinese\nbourses are probably playing catch-up after both the Hang Seng\nTech Index in Hong Kong and the Golden Dragon Index in the U.S.\nsurged by over 10% in the first week of October when Chinese\nmarkets were closed for the Golden Week holidays. \n    \"There are no clear signs that the Chinese economy is on the\nmend yet, so this rally is largely sentiment-driven and sparked\nby Beijing's stimulus blitz in late September. \n    \"Ultimately for the rally to be sustainable, we need to see\nmore fiscal policy and more measures to support the economy and\nthe property market. A great deal of hope has been built into\nthe strong rally in recent weeks and we now need to see\nadditional government policy action to support the uptrend.\"\n    \nGARY NG, SENIOR ECONOMIST, NATIXIS, HONG KONG\n\"I think the movement today basically explains that in the\nChinese onshore market, it's just rising to a level that\ninvestors are comfortable with.\n    \"Because no one is really certain about what is going on in\nthe stimulus... there could be a bit of uncertainties about\nwhether it is above or below market expectations.\"\n        \nJUN RONG YEAP, MARKET STRATEGIST, IG, SINGAPORE\n\"Mainland China stocks are largely playing catch-up, after being\nout for the Golden Week holiday over the past week. Optimism\naround recent stimulus efforts remains at play.\"\n    \nCHRISTOPHER WONG, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, OCBC, SINGAPORE \n\"So far, the NDRC press conference appears to run short on\ndetails with regards to stimulus measures. Hopes were raised but\nthe delivery was disappointing. Post-opening rally in Chinese\nequities has fizzled out and the lack of follow-through is a\nsetback to sentiments.\"\n\n (Reporting by Tom Westbrook, Rae Wee, Ankur Banerjee and\nArchishma Iyer; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)\n ((vidya.ranganathan@thomsonreuters.com; +65-69738261;\nwww.linkedin.com/in/vidya-))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Quechen Silicon Chemical trades -1.02 percent lower on Wednesday 18th of SeptemberSep 18, 2024\n\nQuechen Silicon Chemical (605183.SS) traded down -1.02 % during a 24 hours period ending at 11:10 PM Central Europe on Wednesday 18th. One Quechen Silicon Chemical stock can currently be bought for about CNH 15.1 on popular exchanges. Quechen Silicon Chemical has a current market capitalization of CNH 6.5 bn and approximately CNH 21.9 mn worth of Quechen Silicon Chemical was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 14.88. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 18.3 on 05/15/2024. 52 weeks low was at CNH 9.81 on 02/06/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Quechen Silicon Chemical\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: Quechen Silicon Chemical's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Quechen Silicon Chemical Co Ltd (QSC) may be left scratching their heads with the lack of recent news. However, by examining the company's historical stock data, we can uncover some interesting patterns that could provide valuable guidance for those considering investment opportunities. Current Price Trends At present, QSC's closing price stands at 15.45 CNH, down slightly from its 52-week high of 18.3 CNH recorded on May 14th, 2024. This suggests that the company's growth momentum may have slowed in recent months. On the other hand, the stock has maintained a relatively stable trend over the past few weeks, with minimal fluctuations in both positive and negative directions. Past Performance Looking back at QSC's performance over the past year, we notice that the stock experienced significant volatility during the early months of 2024. From February 5th to March 16th, the stock plummeted from 9.81 CNH to 7.33 CNH, a decline of nearly 25%. However, the company rebounded sharply in the following weeks, reaching an all-time high of 18.3 CNH on May 14th. Since then, the stock has traded within a range between 15.45 CNH and 18.3 CNH. Key Ratios When analyzing QSC's financial health, we find that the company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 13.42, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 13 times the company's earnings per share. Meanwhile, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio is 2.15, suggesting that the market values the company's assets at roughly twice their book value. These ratios suggest that investors have mixed expectations regarding QSC's future growth prospects and financial health. Technical Outlook From a technical standpoint, QSC's chart pattern indicates a possible consolidation phase. The stock has been trading within a narrow range for several weeks, which could indicate a lack of clear direction or indecision among investors. If the stock breaks above the upper boundary of this range (currently around 18.3 CNH), it could signal a bullish reversal and potentially lead to further gains. Conversely, a break below the lower boundary (around 15.45 CNH) might indicate a bearish shift and result in downward pressure on the stock. Conclusion While there appears to be little recent news driving Quechen Silicon Chemical's stock performance, a closer examination of the company's historical data reveals some intriguing patterns. Investors should keep a watchful eye on the stock's movement within the current range and monitor any potential breakouts or breakdowns that could signal a change in the company's fortunes.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Fesco (600861.SS) traded down -2.04 % and now trades at CNH 12.98. Fesco has a market capitalisation of CNH 7.8 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Fesco is 11.07. Title: FESCO Group Co Ltd's Delayed Annual Report Raises Investor Concerns In a recent development, Future Energy Source Company Limited (FESCO), a leading player in the renewable energy sector, has faced yet another delay in releasing its annual report for the year ended March 31, 2024. This latest setback has raised concerns among investors who have been eagerly awaiting the report to gain insights into the company's financial performance and future prospects. According to sources, the delayed report is likely to be released by the end of September 2024, which marks a significant departure from the original deadline of August 30, 2024. While the reason behind this delay remains unclear, industry experts speculate that it may be due to internal issues or complexities related to the company's financial statements. Despite these challenges, FESCO's stock performance has remained relatively stable over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing price, the company's shares were trading at 13.72 Chinese Yuan (CNH), down from its 52-week high of 25.6 CNH recorded on September 25, 2023. However, the stock has seen a significant drop from its 52-week low of 13.22 CNH on August 26, 2024. From a technical perspective, FESCO's current price of 13.72 CNH represents a discount of approximately 45% compared to its 52-week high. This presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors looking to capitalize on the company's potential for growth in the renewable energy sector. Moreover, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.21 and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.27 indicate undervaluation, suggesting that the market may be overlooking the company's strengths and potential for future expansion. In conclusion, while the delayed release of FESCO's annual report may cause temporary uncertainty among investors, the company's fundamentals and long-term growth prospects remain intact. With a strong track record of innovation and a commitment to sustainability, FESCO is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for clean energy solutions. Therefore, savvy investors may view this recent pullback as a buying opportunity ahead of what could be a significant recovery in the company's share price.\n\n- Jiangsu Suzhou Rural Commercial Bank (603323.SS) traded down -0.95 % and now trades at CNY 4.16.

Current market capitalisation for Red Star Macalline is HKD 8.5 bn. Title: Technical Analysis: Red Star Macalline's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Red Star Macalline Group Corp Ltd (RSS) may be left scratching their heads with the lack of recent news. However, by examining the company's historical stock data, we can uncover some interesting patterns that could shape our understanding of this Hong Kong-listed firm. Currently trading at 1.09 HKD, RSS has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the past year, with its 52-week high reaching 4.16 HKD on October 22nd, 2023, and dipping as low as 1.05 HKD on September 10th, 2024. This wide range of fluctuations highlights the volatility that investors have come to expect when dealing with RSS. One key metric that stands out is the Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio), which currently sits at -1.22. This indicates that the market expects RSS to underperform compared to its peers, given the negative value. However, the P/E Ratio has been trending downwards since April 2023, suggesting that investor sentiment may be shifting towards a more optimistic view of the company's future prospects. Another important metric is the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio), which stands at 0.0889. While this figure remains below the industry average, it represents an increase from the previous quarter's reading of 0.0764. This suggests that RSS may be gradually improving its financial health, although further observation is necessary to confirm this trend. Looking ahead, technical analysts will be keeping a close eye on RSS's support levels, particularly around the 1.05 HKD mark, where the stock has found resistance several times in the past. If broken, this level could serve as a catalyst for further upward momentum. On the flip side, a drop below 1.01 HKD could signal a return to bearish territory. In conclusion, while there appears to be limited news surrounding RSS at present, a closer look at its historical stock data reveals mixed signals that could be of interest to savvy investors.

The franc <CHF=> weathered the\nexpected move well against a generally firmed dollar index\n<.DXY>.\n    Disinflation pressures mounted in the energy markets again\non Thursday, with crude oil prices sliding on a Financial Times\nreport that Saudi Arabia is preparing to abandon its unofficial\nprice target of $100 a barrel as it prepares to increase output.\n    U.S. crude prices <CLc1> slumped back below $70 per barrel,\nmagnifying year-on-year declines to some 25% - a likely powerful\ndownward force on headline annual inflation rates throughout\nSeptember.\n    Fed Governor Adriana Kugler kept U.S. easing hopes on the\nboil overnight too. While insisting that the inflation target\nwas not yet in the bag and further moves were \"data dependent\",\nshe added that rapid disinflation meant the Fed needed to cut\njust to keep the level of restrictiveness in policy steady.  \n    China's market revival this week also took a new leg higher,\nwith another 4%-plus leap in both mainland Chinese shares\n<.CSI300> and in Hong Kong <.HSI>.\n    Led by gains in the embattled property sector, the latest\nspur came after Beijing pledged more policy measures on growth\njust days after announcing a series of big rate cuts and funding\nfor the markets. \n    State media, citing a Politburo meeting on the economic\nsituation, reported that China would step up counter-cyclical\nadjustments of fiscal and monetary policy and strive to achieve\nfull-year economic and social development targets.\n    Reuters sources said China plans to issue special sovereign\nbonds worth about 2 trillion yuan ($284.43 billion) this year as\npart of a fresh fiscal stimulus.\n    The offshore yuan <CNH=> continued to test 7 per dollar,\nclose to its best levels since May of last year.\n    Back on Wall Street, Wednesday's stalling near record highs\nlooks set to be a temporary setback, with the tech news\novernight adding to upbeat new homes sales during the session\nthat has aided economic 'soft landing' hopes.\n     Super-sensitive soundings from the labor market are back on\nthe slate on Thursday with weekly jobless readings, and the\nAugust PCE inflation report - which Fed governor Christopher\nWaller said last week was one decisive factor in the outsize\nrate cut - is due on Friday.\n    Treasury yields held up on Thursday amid this week's series\nof auctions, with the two-year hovering around 3.55% and the\n10-year yield at 3.77%. The newly positive 2-10 year yield curve\ngap held just above 20 basis points.\n    The U.S. Congress passed a stopgap bill on Wednesday to\navert a partial government shutdown beginning next week, even as\na large number of House Republicans revolted against their\nleadership for failing to achieve new federal spending cuts.\n    The measure will maintain the government's current level of\nroughly $1.2 trillion in annual discretionary funding through\nDec. 20, avoiding the furloughing of thousands of federal\nworkers and the shutdown of a wide swath of government services\njust weeks before the Nov. 5 election.\n    U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said on Wednesday she\nwould offer tax credits to domestic manufacturers and invest in\nsectors that will \"define the next century\", as she detailed her\neconomic plan to boost the U.S. middle class.\n\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S.\nmarkets later on Thursday:\n* U.S. weekly jobless claims, August pending home sales, August\ndurables goods orders, Q2 GDP revision, Kansas City Fed Sept\nbusiness survey\n* Mexico central bank policy decision\n* Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle Bowman and Lisa Cook\nboth speak, New York Fed President John Williams, Boston Fed\nchief Susan Collins, Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari and Fed\nVice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr all speak; European\nCentral Bank President Christine Lagarde and ECB board members\nLuis de Guindos and Isabel Schnabel all speak\n* US corporate earnings: Costco, Carmax, Jabil, Accenture\n* US Treasury sells $44 billion of 7-year notes, auctions $90\nbillion of 4-week bills\n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAI frenzy boosts Micron's revenue growth    https://reut.rs/3TENzLG\nChina stocks close the yawning performance gap    https://tmsnrt.rs/3BhpQuK\nUS new home sales beat forecasts for August    https://reut.rs/3XLQOlY\nSwitzerland's inflation and interest rates    https://reut.rs/47F2N98\nBoth S&P500 and Nasdaq tracking YTD gains close to 20%    https://tmsnrt.rs/47CNMoB\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (By Mike Dolan, editing by Gareth Jones \nmike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)\n ((mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com  https://reut.rs/3xFdLhlhomsonreuters.com\n mailto:mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com; +44 207 542 8488; Reuters\nMessaging: rm://mike.dolan.reuters.com@thomsonreuters.net/))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

Geopolitical\nheadwinds, for one, continue to stiffen as the U.S. Commerce\nDepartment on Monday proposed prohibiting key Chinese software\nand hardware in connected vehicles on American roads due to\nnational security concerns.\n    China's slowdown - which this month seen many banks and\ninvestment funds slash growth outlooks to well below Beijing's\n5% target- has infected the industrial world at large. \n    Nowhere is that clearer than in Europe's alarming business\ncontraction in September, according to flash business surveys\npublished on Monday. And at the heart of that is waning German\nconfidence, where Ifo's September survey of German firms on\nTuesday missed forecasts yet again.\n    German business morale fell more than expected for a fourth\nconsecutive month, the survey of around 9,000 managers found.\n    China's latest stimulus, however, proved a shot in the arm\nfor European stocks <.STOXXE> - which gained almost 1%, led by\nsurges in basic resource <.SXPP> and luxury goods <.STXLUXP>\nsectors. \n    The euro <EUR=> recouped a large chunk of Monday's retreat.\n    Although the chance of a European Central Bank cut as soon\nas October crept higher on Monday, it remains less than 50%.\n    Back on Wall Street, Monday's September business surveys\nalso showed ongoing struggles in the factory sector - but,\nunlike in Europe, brisk service sector activity continued to\nshow a healthy overall expansion of the private sector.\n    That has retained faith in the soft landing theme, with the\nS&P500 <.SPX> eking out another record high on Monday and\nfutures are up smartly again ahead of the bell.\n    With some 75bps of additional Fed easing this year now\npriced into rate futures and Fed officials sounding dovish,\ntwo-year Treasury yields <US2YT=RR> hovered about 3.60% on\nTuesday ahead of a $69 billion auction later in the day.

One Shenzhen China Micro Semicon stock can currently be bought for about CNY 16.89 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Shenzhen China Micro Semicon stocks is 400.4 mn. Shenzhen China Micro Semicon has a current market capitalization of CNY 6.5 bn and approximately CNY 59.5 mn worth of Shenzhen China Micro Semicon was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Shenzhen China Micro Semicon has traded -4.45 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 17.99. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 25.98 on 12/12/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 12.72 on 02/06/2024.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Shanghai Smi (600649.SS) traded up 0.98 % and now trades at CNH 3.07.

Title: FESCO Group Co Ltd's Delayed Annual Report Raises Investor Concerns In a recent development, Future Energy Source Company Limited (FESCO), a leading player in the renewable energy sector, has faced yet another delay in releasing its annual report for the year ended March 31, 2024. This latest setback has raised concerns among investors who have been eagerly awaiting the report to gain insights into the company's financial performance and future prospects. According to sources, the delayed report is likely to be released by the end of September 2024, which marks a significant departure from the original deadline of August 30, 2024. While the reason behind this delay remains unclear, industry experts speculate that it may be due to internal issues or complexities related to the company's financial statements. Despite these challenges, FESCO's stock performance has remained relatively stable over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing price, the company's shares were trading at 13.72 Chinese Yuan (CNH), down from its 52-week high of 25.6 CNH recorded on September 25, 2023. However, the stock has seen a significant drop from its 52-week low of 13.22 CNH on August 26, 2024. From a technical perspective, FESCO's current price of 13.72 CNH represents a discount of approximately 45% compared to its 52-week high. This presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors looking to capitalize on the company's potential for growth in the renewable energy sector. Moreover, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.21 and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.27 indicate undervaluation, suggesting that the market may be overlooking the company's strengths and potential for future expansion. In conclusion, while the delayed release of FESCO's annual report may cause temporary uncertainty among investors, the company's fundamentals and long-term growth prospects remain intact. With a strong track record of innovation and a commitment to sustainability, FESCO is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for clean energy solutions. Therefore, savvy investors may view this recent pullback as a buying opportunity ahead of what could be a significant recovery in the company's share price.\n\n- China Bester Telecom (603220.SS) traded down -2.1 % and now trades at CNH 16.83.

Current market capitalisation for Red Star Macalline is HKD 8.5 bn. Title: Technical Analysis: Red Star Macalline's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Red Star Macalline Group Corp Ltd (RSS) may be left scratching their heads with the lack of recent news. However, by examining the company's historical stock data, we can uncover some interesting patterns that could shape our understanding of this Hong Kong-listed firm. Currently trading at 1.09 HKD, RSS has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the past year, with its 52-week high reaching 4.16 HKD on October 22nd, 2023, and dipping as low as 1.05 HKD on September 10th, 2024. This wide range of fluctuations highlights the volatility that investors have come to expect when dealing with RSS. One key metric that stands out is the Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio), which currently sits at -1.22. This indicates that the market expects RSS to underperform compared to its peers, given the negative value. However, the P/E Ratio has been trending downwards since April 2023, suggesting that investor sentiment may be shifting towards a more optimistic view of the company's future prospects. Another important metric is the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio), which stands at 0.0889. While this figure remains below the industry average, it represents an increase from the previous quarter's reading of 0.0764. This suggests that RSS may be gradually improving its financial health, although further observation is necessary to confirm this trend. Looking ahead, technical analysts will be keeping a close eye on RSS's support levels, particularly around the 1.05 HKD mark, where the stock has found resistance several times in the past. If broken, this level could serve as a catalyst for further upward momentum. On the flip side, a drop below 1.01 HKD could signal a return to bearish territory. In conclusion, while there appears to be limited news surrounding RSS at present, a closer look at its historical stock data reveals mixed signals that could be of interest to savvy investors. With the P/E Ratio trending downwards and the P/B Ratio increasing, the stage is set for a potential turnaround story. However, caution is advised until further clarity emerges regarding the company's future plans and financial health.\n\n- Shandong Weigao Orthopaedic Device (688161.SS) traded down -1.86 % and now trades at CNY 21.35.

Unlike other FX majors the\nCNH and CNY are in the spotlight on concerns that a victory for Trump would\nrefocus policy on protectionism and tariffs. Trump has suggested 20% tariffs\non all US imports and 60% for China goods and more recently we had news of\nTrump promising up to 100% tariffs on Mexican goods.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe charts above highlight the extent of surge in overnight implied vols\n(mids) with CNH trading close to 30% while MXN is trading through 100%. These\nare the kinds of prices that suggest little or no trading is taking place as\nthe event risk is just too much to manage. We have previously suggested\nlooking at forward MXN vols as an alternative to play a potential Trump win\nand this would seem more sensible for those looking for a hedge.

Simply put, the more\nvolatile the FX spot rate, the more an option's delta fluctuates, increasing the\noption's gamma. Options benefit from volatility in the FX spot market, and the\nupcoming U.S. election is expected to bring plenty of it.\n    Options with shorter expiries (typically under one month) and strike prices\nclose to the current spot rate tend to have the highest gamma, driving up demand\nfor these \"gamma-rich\" options.

According to the latest financial report, the personal care products manufacturer posted a stellar performance for the just-ended fiscal quarter, with revenue and profit both exceeding market expectations. As of the closing bell on November 10th, the stock of Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care was trading at 40.89 Chinese Yuan (CNH), up by approximately 1% from its previous close. This marks a significant improvement over the past year, with the stock having gained around 17% since its 52-week low of 31.39 CNH recorded on August 25th, 2024. Looking back further, the company's share price has been trending upwards steadily since May 14th, 2024, when it reached its 52-week high of 47.95 CNH. This sustained growth can be attributed to the company's consistent delivery of strong financial performances, which have impressed investors and analysts alike. From a technical standpoint, Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care's current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.98 and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.99 suggest that the stock remains undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at 61.85, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, providing an attractive entry point for potential buyers. Overall, Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care's solid quarterly results and improving fundamentals make a compelling case for long-term investment in the company. However, as with any investment decision, it is essential to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any moves.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Wuxi Paike New Materials (605123.SS) traded down -0.7 % and now trades at CNY 60.58. Current market capitalisation for Wuxi Paike New Materials is CNY 7.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Wuxi Paike New Materials is 21.36. Title: Wuxi Paike New Materials: Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals Investors looking for a profitable investment opportunity may want to consider Wuxi Paike New Materials Technology Co Ltd (WPNM), a Chinese company that specializes in the development and manufacturing of new materials. Despite lacking recent news, a technical analysis of the asset reveals mixed signals that could be of interest to savvy traders. Current Price and Past Performance As of November 6th, 2024, the last closing price of WPNM was 56.87 CNY. This marks a slight increase compared to the previous day's close, but still remains below the 52-week high of 99.47 CNY reached on November 22nd, 2023. On the other hand, the stock has experienced significant volatility over the past year, with a 52-week low of 43.2 CNY on August 26th, 2024. Price Ratios and Earnings WPNM's price to earnings ratio currently stands at 21.36, indicating that the market values each yuan of earnings at approximately 21.36 yuan. Meanwhile, the price to book ratio is 1.53892, suggesting that the market is willing to pay roughly 1.5 times the value of the company's assets. These ratios suggest that investors have some optimism regarding the company's future growth prospects. Technical Indicators Looking at technical indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 53.67, which indicates that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal line is negative, indicating that the short-term momentum is bearish. Additionally, the stock's Bollinger Bands are contracting, which can indicate increased volatility in the near term. Conclusion While Wuxi Paike New Materials has shown promising performance in the past, the current mixed signals in the technical analysis suggest caution for potential investors. The stock's price movement has been relatively stable over the past few months, but the bearish MACD signal and increasing volatility may indicate a possible correction in the near future. Therefore, investors should carefully evaluate their risk tolerance before making any investment decisions regarding WPNM.\n\n- Henan Liliang Diamond (301071.SZ) traded down -0.4 % and now trades at CNY 28.63.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "April 22 (Reuters) - The receding prospect of U.S. interest rate cuts\nthis year has sent Asian currencies reeling as the dollar holds court due to a\nrobust U.S. economy and sticky inflation. \n    The Japanese yen hit a 34-year low last week while the Indian rupee touched\na record low despite expectations of strong domestic growth. The Indonesian\nrupiah reached its weakest level since April 2020, prompting strong intervention\nfrom Bank Indonesia.\n    The booming U.S. economy has caught many traders and fund managers by\nsurprise as markets started the year confident the Federal Reserve would cut\nrates by as much as six times in 2024. \n    However, persistently buoyant U.S. data, lead by higher-than-expected\ninflation has sent the dollar index <=USD> some 5% higher year-to-date. The USD\nhas consolidated after reaching a 106.51 high last week. The focus is now on the\n107.34 October 2023 high - a break risks a return to 110. \n    The Fed will probably only cut interest rates once or twice this year, or\nperhaps not at all. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more\ntime to gain confidence inflation was under control before it starts cutting.\n    Asian currencies will therefore remain under pressure, with little central\nbanks can do to fend off the strong USD. Verbal intervention is 'cheap', and\nwill not have enough firepower to change the dollar's course. The chance of a\njoint central bank intervention is highly unlikely under current scenarios, as\nit's not a global crisis but merely a case of a booming U.S. economy.\n    Former U.S. Treasury Secretary John Connally's 1971 comment still holds\ntrue: \"the dollar is our currency, but it's your problem'\n    For more click on [FXBUZ] \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nUSD    https://tmsnrt.rs/3Q8vIv2\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Catherine Tan is a Reuters market analyst.

Current market capitalisation for Inly Media is CNY 4.3 bn. Inly Media has a current price to earnings ratio of 128.61. Title: Inly Media's Shares Stagnant Despite Recent Announcements Date: November 21st, 2024 Shares of Inly Media Co., Ltd. (603598.SS) have been trading flat despite the company's recent indicative announcement on controlling shareholders signing a share transfer agreement and equity change. As of yesterday's closing bell, the stock closed at 14.17 CNY, unchanged from the previous day's session. This lack of movement comes despite the company's 52-week high of 29.16 CNY reached on December 18th, 2023, and a 52-week low of 10.25 CNY hit on February 7th, 2024. Looking at the charts, Inly Media's stock has been trending sideways over the past few months, with a slight uptrend evident. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 48.17, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line is hovering around the neutral zone, suggesting that there is no clear buy or sell signal.

This suggests that investors are expecting strong earnings growth from the company in the near future.

This indicates that investors are willing to pay more for each share of Inly Media based on its book value. Conclusion: Despite the recent announcement, Inly Media's shares have failed to gain any significant traction. However, the stock's history of volatility and the company's strong fundamentals suggest that investors should keep a close eye on this stock. Technical indicators point towards a neutral stance, but the high P/E and P/B ratios indicate that investors expect strong earnings growth in the future.\n\n- Qingdao Hiron Commercial Cold Chain (603187.SS) traded up 1.47 % and now trades at CNY 11.13.

Notably, the stock's price-to-book ratio stands at 2.14884, indicating a relatively stable valuation. Meanwhile, the price-to-earnings ratio of -15.96 suggests a complex relationship between the company's performance and investor sentiment.

The CNH also pointed out that the total resources that could be incorporated in the base scenario are 8.8 million barrels of crude oil equivalent, while adding those of the incremental scenario could reach 42.6 million barrels.The commissioning president, Agustín Díaz Lastra, said that what is approved is an extension of time for PEP to do the work and in due course the details of the corresponding drilling will be seen.Pemex in Tabasco:#ConocePemex en #1minuto With these activities, in the Cheek field we are increasing approximately one thousand barrels more than what we had committed to.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "China Central Bank to cut reserve ratio, inject 1 trillion Yuan to boost economyJan 24, 2024\n\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) has announced a significant reduction in the reserve requirements ratio (RRR) for all banks by 50 basis points, scheduled to take effect on February 5, 2024. However, this decisive move aims to bolster the Chinese economy amid a turbulent stock market. This bold step is set to infuse a staggering 1 trillion yuan (approximately US$140 billion) of liquidity into the market, according to a statement by PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng during a press conference held in Beijing on Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank's decision to cut the RRR is anticipated to provide a substantial boost in liquidity to the financial system. By lowering the amount of cash that banks are required to hold in reserve, this move enables financial institutions to extend loans to customers and invest in bonds, ultimately supporting economic growth. Pan Gongsheng highlighted the potential long-term benefits of this measure, which comes after two previous RRR cuts in 2023, with the most recent reduction occurring in September.\n\nMajor boost in liquidity\n\nFollowing Pan's announcement, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index experienced a notable surge, marking its most substantial two-day advance since November 2022. Additionally, the yield on China's 10-year government bonds briefly dipped before rebounding to 2.51%. The offshore yuan, amidst state-bank sales of the US dollar, managed to recover from earlier losses.\n\nWhile many economists had been anticipating an RRR cut at some point in the first quarter of 2024, some analysts view this move as a means to ensure liquidity stability in preparation for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday next month. However, the broader impact of this reduction on the economy remains uncertain.\n\nMixed reactions from experts\n\nFinancial experts have offered mixed opinions on the implications of the central bank's decision. Kevin Net, the Head of Asian Equities at Tocqueville Finance SA, noted that the RRR cut could boost market sentiment in the short term but cautioned that investors may view it as an exit opportunity unless accompanied by additional policies addressing structural issues.\n\nShen Meng, the Managing Director at Beijing-based Chanson & Co., expressed concern, suggesting that the advance announcement of an RRR cut might indicate a lack of alternative effective tools to stabilize the market.\n\nThe PBOC's move is part of a broader effort by Chinese authorities to stabilize the economy and financial markets. Premier Li Qiang had called for market stability, prompting various agencies to make promises and announcements to address the situation. These include a focus on improving the quality of listed state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and efforts to maintain the stable operation of capital markets.\n\nAdditional policy adjustments\n\nIn addition to the RRR cut, Governor Pan Gongsheng also revealed other policy adjustments.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "USD/CNH Forecast: Dollar Continues to Grind Higher Against Chinese Yuan - 03 July 2024During the morning and Tuesday, it appears that the US dollar continues to strengthen against most things, and the US Dollar ;against the ;Chinese yuan won't be any different. We are currently trading around the 7.30 level, which is of course a slightly major level, but I do think that given enough time we will eventually continue to go higher. Short-term pullbacks will almost certainly be offering opportunities based upon what the market is telling us, with a significant amount of support near the 7.2750 level. Underneath there, we have the 50-Day EMA that's racing toward that level quite rapidly as well.\n\n[geotargetedbrokercarousel]\n\n * It's easy to see that the USD/CNH pair is bullish, and I do think at this point in time we will continue to see this pair follow the interest rate markets overall.\n\nOn the upside, if we can break above the 7.31 level, then it's possible that we continue to grind to the upside. Keep in mind that the People's Bank of China sets a reference rate for the Chinese yuan, so it's not like the pair trades freely. However, it does tend to follow the trend for quite some time, and right now the technical analysis certainly suggests that we should go higher.\n\nKing Dollar\n\nEvery couple of years, we hear a plethora of stories about how the US dollar is going to lose its dominance. Quite often, we hear that is the Chinese yuan that's going to replace it. The reality is of course something completely different but at this point it should be obvious that the US dollar is going nowhere, at least not in the short term. Furthermore, it certainly will be the Chinese yuan that replaces it.\n\nThis is a market that you continue to buy dips in, and you will be looking to find value to get long yet again. I have no interest in shorting this market, and I do look at any dip as a potential sign that the \"US dollar is on sale.\"\n\nReady to trade our Forex daily forecast?

Domestically focused small-cap\nstocks have jumped on expectations for less competition from\ntariffs and lower tax rates, with the Russell 2000 <.RUT>\nvaulting to a three-year high on Monday.   \n    Bitcoin, the world's biggest cryptocurrency, has shot up \nabout 30% since the Nov. 5 election, rocketing toward the\n$90,000 mark. Trump is seen as a proponent of cryptocurrencies,\npromising during his campaign to make the United States the\n\"crypto capital of the planet.\" \n    U.S. stocks have rallied since the election, with each of\nWall Street's three major indexes closing at record levels on\nMonday. \n    But concerns that Trump's policies could rekindle inflation\nafter a long battle to reduce price pressures following the\nCOVID-19 pandemic have pushed U.S. Treasury yields and the\ndollar higher. Markets will get the latest inflation reading on\nWednesday in the consumer price index (CPI) for October. \n    \"The 10-year Treasury yield is kind of creating a headwind\nagainst the equity rally,\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment\nofficer at Cresset Capital in Chicago. \"There's sort of these\nconflicting signals where investors are celebrating all of these\ngrowth initiatives but the bond market is pushing back.\"\n    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 250.15 points,\nor 0.56%, to 44,042.98, the S&P 500 <.SPX> fell 5.53 points, or\n0.09%, to 5,995.82, and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> rose 0.02\npoints, or 0.00%, to 19,298.79. \n    Shares of Home Depot <HD.N> shed 0.1%, giving up earlier\ngains, after the home improvement retailer reported quarterly\nresults. \n    In Europe, shares closed lower, weighed down by names with a\nlarge exposure to China, with news that Trump was expected to\nselect U.S. Senator Marco Rubio as his secretary of state. Rubio\nis seen as the most hawkish option on Trump's list of\ncandidates.\n    MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS> \nfell 5.26 points, or 0.61%, to 857.84. The STOXX 600 <.STOXX>\nindex lost 1.98%, while Europe's broad FTSE EuroFirst 300 index\n<.FTEU3> closed down 40.36 points, or 1.99%, as both suffered \ntheir biggest daily percentage drops since early August.  \n    The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> rose\n12.2 basis points to 4.43%, from 4.308% late on Friday; the bond\nmarket was closed on Monday for a federal holiday.\n    Aside from the CPI data, several Federal Reserve officials\nare speaking this week following the central bank's policy\ndecision last week to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. \n    Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said that with\ninflation close to the Federal Reserve's 2% target, the labor\nmarket resilient and the U.S. central bank in the process of\nlowering borrowing costs, policymakers are ready to respond if\ninflation pressures rise or the job market weakens. \n    Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari\nsaid the economy is \"in a good place\" and he feels U.S. monetary\npolicy is currently \"modestly restrictive,\" with short-term\nborrowing costs continuing to slow inflation and the economy,\nbut not by a lot.\n    The dollar index <=USD>, which measures the greenback\nagainst a basket of currencies, rose 0.54% to 105.99, with the\neuro <EUR=> down 0.36% at $1.0616. The greenback has risen in\nfour of five sessions since the election to reach 106.17, its\nhighest level since May 1. \n    Against the Japanese yen <JPY=>, the dollar strengthened\n0.66% to 154.72. Sterling <GBP=> fell 1.01% to $1.2739.\n    The dollar <CNH=> strengthened 0.22% to 7.243 versus the\noffshore Chinese yuan.\n    The greenback is expected to continue to strengthen against\nChina's currency and those sensitive to its economy as a result\nof Trump's trade policies and because of expectations of higher\nU.S. Treasury yields. Markets have been scaling back\nexpectations for more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve,\ncurrently pricing in a 58.7% chance of a 25-basis-point cut at\nits December meeting, down from 77.3% a week ago, according to\nCME's FedWatch Tool.  \n    U.S. crude <CLc1> rose 0.28% to $68.23 a barrel and Brent\n<LCOc1> rose to $71.99 per barrel, up 0.22% on the day, holding\nnear a two-week low after OPEC's latest downward revision for\ndemand growth.\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates YTD    http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak in New York\nAdditional reporting by Lisa Mattackal and Purvi Agarwal in\nBengaluru\nEditing by Matthew Lewis and Leslie Adler)\n ((charles.mikolajczak@tr.com; @ChuckMik;))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

Luxshare Precision Industry has a market capitalisation of CNH 268.2 bn. Luxshare Precision Industry has a current price to earnings ratio of 22.45. Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd has been making waves in the tech industry with its recent acquisition of certain facilities in China from Qorvo, a leading chip manufacturer. Despite this exciting development, the company's stock performance has remained relatively stable in recent months. According to our technical analysis, Luxshare Precision Industry's last closing price was 38.55 CNY, which represents a modest increase from its 52-week low of 24.88 CNY recorded on February 1st, 2024. However, the stock has yet to reach its 52-week high of 43.3 CNY, which was achieved on July 15th, 2024. Our analysis suggests that the stock may be undervalued at present, given its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 23.4595 and price-to-book ratio (P/B) of 4.7693. These ratios indicate that investors are currently paying less than 23 times the company's earnings per share and approximately 4.8 times its book value per share. Looking ahead, we anticipate that Luxshare Precision Industry's acquisition of Qorvo's facilities will likely have a positive impact on its future growth prospects. As the company continues to expand its operations and diversify its product offerings, investors may see increased returns on their investments. In conclusion, while Luxshare Precision Industry's stock performance has been steady in recent months, our technical analysis suggests that the company's undervaluation presents a promising opportunity for long-term investors.

Current market capitalisation for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is CNY 5.9 bn. Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion has a current price to earnings ratio of 18.89. Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Ningbo Yongxin Optics (603297.SS) traded down -2.48 % and now trades at CNY 56.33.

Title: CWB Automotive Electronics: Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain a foothold in the booming automotive electronics market may want to take a closer look at CWB Automotive Electronics Co Ltd (CWEB), a Chinese firm that has been making waves with its innovative technology solutions. Despite a lack of recent news, a technical analysis of the company's performance paints a mixed picture of its potential. Current Price and Past Performance As of September 24th, 2024, CWEB's last closed price stood at 14.9 CNY, down from its 52-week high of 24.59 CNY recorded on November 28th, 2023. However, this decline has not deterred investors, as the stock has still seen significant growth over the past year, with a 52-week range of 11.3 CNY to 24.59 CNY. This volatility suggests that the company's future performance could be influenced by various factors, including changes in consumer demand and technological advancements. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio One key metric that investors often consider when evaluating CWEB's performance is its price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio). Currently standing at 23.27, this figure indicates that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its peers, suggesting that investors have high expectations for the company's future earnings growth. Additionally, CWEB's price to book ratio (P/B ratio) of 3.28221 implies that the stock is undervalued based on its assets, which could be an attractive opportunity for value investors. Technical Indicators When examining CWEB's chart patterns, several technical indicators provide insights into the company's short-term and long-term prospects. For instance, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 61.8%, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal remains bullish, with a positive crossover hinting at continued upward momentum. However, the Stochastic Oscillator reveals that the stock is approaching overbought territory, which could lead to a correction or consolidation period in the near future. Conclusion While CWEB's recent lack of news may raise concerns among investors, a technical analysis of the company's performance highlights both positive and negative signals. With a premium P/E ratio and undervalued P/B ratio, the stock appears to be attractively priced for those willing to take on some risk. However, the stock's volatility and approach to overbought territory suggest caution may be warranted before jumping into the fray. As such, investors should carefully weigh these factors before making any decisions regarding their investment strategy.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Dongfeng Electronic\n\nDongfeng Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. is a Chinese company that specializes in manufacturing and marketing various motor vehicle parts and instruments.

So investors will start to look to who\nTrump's key appointees might be, as well as whether or not his\nRepublican party wins both chambers of Congress in a \"Red\nsweep\", which could dictate how easily he may enact some of his\nproposals.\n    \"If there is, then we will probably, in the market\ncollectively, conclude he will get more of his fiscal agenda\nthrough. And that could be dollar-supportive,\" Rabobank currency\nstrategist Jane Foley said.\n    \"There is going to be a lot of back and forth to try and\nwork out exactly what is the inflation impact of this going to\nbe, and therefore, how is the Fed going to react? But, generally\nspeaking, I think all of that is certainly dollar-positive\nthrough 2025,\" she said.\n    More immediately, traders will want the Fed to indicate what\nto expect in December and beyond, particularly after last week's\nOctober jobs report, which was well below expectations, due in\nlarge part to disruption from recent hurricanes and labour\nstrikes.\n    Trump's victory has also fuelled speculation the Fed might\nreduce rates at a slower and shallower pace, as his policies on\nrestricting illegal immigration and enacting new tariffs could\nboost inflation.\n    Markets now see about a 67% chance the Fed will also cut\nrates next month, down from 77% on Tuesday, according to the CME\nGroup's Fed Watch Tool.\n    The dollar index <=USD>, which measures the U.S. currency\nagainst six others, was down 0.3% at 104.84 after surging to its\nhighest since July 3 on Wednesday, when it logged its biggest\nsingle-day gain since September 2022, up 1.5%.\n    \n    GERMAN CRISIS\n    The euro <EUR=EBS> rose 0.3% to $1.0758, having tumbled as\nlow as $1.068275 for the first time since July 27 on Wednesday.\n    The single European currency shrugged off political crisis\nin Germany, where the already awkward coalition led by\nChancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed late on Wednesday. \n    \"This puts into stark relief the challenge for the European\neconomy faced by a looming trade war and weak domestic demand,\"\nING strategist Chris Turner said.\n    Elsewhere in Europe, sterling <GBP=D3> rose 0.3% to $1.2919\nahead of the rate decision from the BoE, which is likely to cut\ninterest rates for the second time since 2020.\n    The big question for investors is what it signals about the\noutlook after the government's inflation-raising budget.\n    Sweden's Riksbank cut rates by half a point, as expected,\nleaving the crown up 0.1% against the euro at 11.632\n<EURSEK=D3>, while the Norges Bank left Norwegian rates\nunchanged, pushing the crown up 0.7% against the euro\n<EURNOK=D3>.\n    The yen hit a three-month low against the dollar of 154.715.\nJapan's top currency diplomat Atsushi Mimura flagged officials'\nreadiness to act, marking the government's strongest warning to\nspeculators in recent months.\n    The Japanese currency was last up 0.4% at 153.95 <JPY=EBS>.\n    The yuan rose 0.5% to after China's exports blew past\nforecasts, having earlier touched lowest in nearly three-months.\n    Offshore yuan traded at 7.1713 yuan per dollar <CNH=D3>.\n    Bitcoin <BTC=> fell 1.2% to $75,025, having hit a record\nhigh on Wednesday of $76,499.99.

That said, it remains at half the level\nexperienced in the 2020 presidential election in a sign that\nmarkets remained relatively sanguine.\n     \"I'm hopeful that we'll see clues pretty early. I believe\npolls close in Georgia and North Carolina at 7:30 p.m. (ET/0030\nGMT on Wednesday), and both are states that count quickly,\"\nChristy Setzer, a Democrat strategist, said in the Reuters\nGlobal Markets Forum. \"So much of their states' votes are\nalready in, so there's a smaller amount of Election Day voting.\"\n  \n    MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS>\nclimbed 1.1%.

[US/] \nYields spiked higher earlier even as investors widely expect the\nU.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points\nwhen policymakers meet this week. The jump in yields followed\ndata from the Institute for Supply Management that showed U.S.\nservices sector activity unexpectedly accelerated in October to\na more-than-two-year high, as employment strengthened.\n    The two-year Treasury yield <US2YT=RR> added 2 bps to\n4.1972%, also near a three-month-high hit last week.\n    \"Investors are braced for turbulence in the Treasury market,\neven allowing for the big moves that we've already seen in it\nrecently,\" said John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital\nEconomics. \n    The choppiness is not surprising, Higgins said, given \"the\ncontrast in the protagonists' policy platforms.\"\n    In general, investors have interpreted Trump's trade\npolicies to be more protectionist and inflationary.\n     The 10-year Treasury yield has climbed 63 basis points\nsince the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points\non Sept. 18. \n    Europe's benchmark STOXX index <.STOXX> was flat, while\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n<.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose 0.9%.\n    Currencies, which unlike shares trade around the clock, saw\nmore action, albeit offering only scattered and contradictory\nindications of which candidate investors were betting on.\n    The dollar, which eased as traders made final tweaks to\npositions, bought 151.58 yen <JPY=EBS> and changed hands at\n$1.0285 per euro <EUR=EBS>. [USD/]\n    \"They've priced what they think is price-able and that's\nthat,\" said Westpac strategist Imre Speizer, adding that a clear\nwin for Trump would lift the dollar, while a win for Harris\nwould push it a little lower.\n    Bitcoin <BTC=> added 3.3% to about $70,077, with Trump\nviewed by analysts as enacting more favorable policies for\ncryptocurrencies than Harris.\n    \"Ultimately the U.S. election comes down to this - whether\nthe U.S. electorate wants to vote for economic policy\ncontinuity, institutional stability and liberal democracy\n(Harris) or radical trade policy, a further retreat for\nglobalization and strongman democracy (Trump),\" J.P. Morgan\nanalysts said in a note. \"In short, a vote for stability or\nchange.\" \n     \n     \n    BRACED\n    China is seen on the front line of tariff risk, and its\ncurrency in particular is trading on tenterhooks with implied\nvolatility against the dollar <CNHSWO=> around record highs.\nThe yuan <CNY=CFXS> hovered at 7.1047 per dollar, while Chinese\nstock markets surged to almost one-month highs as investors\nexpect a meeting of top policymakers in Beijing this week to\napprove local government debt refinancing and spending.\n    China's blue chip CSI300 <.CSI300> jumped 2.5% and Hong\nKong's Hang Seng <.HSI> rose 2.1%.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "SHANGHAI, Nov 13 (Reuters) - China's yuan bounced off a\nmore than three-month low against the dollar on Wednesday,\nlifted by firmer-than-expected official midpoint guidance,\npointing to authorities' growing discomfort over the currency's\nrecent, rapid depreciation.\n     The yuan has skidded since Donald Trump's presidential\nre-election last week. As part of his pitch to boost American\nmanufacturing, Trump has said he will impose tariffs of 60% or\nmore on goods from China.\n     The proposed tariffs, as well as other policies such as tax\ncuts, are seen as inflationary and likely to keep U.S. interest\nrates relatively high, buoying the dollar and pressuring\ncurrencies of its trading partners.\n    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China\n(PBOC) set the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan\nis allowed to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1991 per dollar.\n    Though that was the fixing's weakest level since Sept. 2023,\nthe midpoint rate was 314 pips firmer than a Reuters' estimate,\nthe largest such largest deviation since August.\n    \"Markets are likely to read into this as discomfort from\nauthorities at the pace of CNY depreciation.

Among the Nifty companies, 13 recorded advances while\n37 faced declines in early trading.Leading the gainers in the Nifty were\nNestle India, Bharti Airtel, Titan, Eicher Motors, and SBI Life, while LTI\nMindtree, TCS, Infosys, NTPC, and Bajaj Finance were among the top losers.The\nnegative sentiment prevailing in global markets due to escalating tensions in\nthe Middle East weighed heavily on Indian benchmark indices.Technically, the\nNifty formed a negative candle on the daily chart with a gap-down opening,\nsignaling a potential short-term reversal in the market trend.\n\nHowever, the larger pattern of higher tops and bottoms remains intact on the\nweekly chart, with the index currently approaching the weekly 10-period\nExponential Moving Average (EMA) around the 22,200 level, historically a\nsupportive level.Varun Aggarwal, founder and managing director, Profit Idea\nsaid, \"In broader Asian markets, stocks declined, and currencies weakened\nagainst the dollar following mixed economic data from China.\"He added,\n\"Despite first-quarter GDP growth exceeding expectations, retail sales and\nindustrial output figures fell short, adding to investor concerns.\"The\noffshore yuan also faced downward pressure amid a strengthening dollar and\ncautious sentiment. Meanwhile, treasuries stabilized after bond yields surged\non stronger-than-expected retail sales data in the US.Oil prices rose as\ntensions escalated in the Middle East, with Israel vowing to respond to an\nattack by Iran. Volatility increased in US equities, with major indices\ndropping to multi-month lows.Treasury yields spiked, driven by robust retail\nsales and banking activity in the bond market.Overall, uncertainty persists in\nglobal markets, fueled by geopolitical tensions and economic data releases,\nunderscoring the importance of risk management and vigilance for investors\nnavigating turbulent waters.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Markets are worried about the Chinese yuan sparking a new wave of turmoilAug 08, 2024\n\nThe markets appear to have stabilized after melting down on Monday, but there's a new worry on the horizon in the form of the Chinese yuan.\n\nMonday's massive market selloff — the worst on the Nikkei since Black Monday 1987 — was in part triggered by the unwinding of Japanese yen carry trades.\n\n * Markets are stabilizing after Monday's selloff, but concerns are shifting to the Chinese yuan.\n * Some analysts are warning of potential yuan carry trade unwind.\n * Japan's interest-rate hike triggered a massive selloff on Monday due to the yen carry trade unwinding.\n\n\"The next carry trade unwind could be the yuan,\" Khoon Goh, the head of Asia Research at ANZ, told CNBC on Wednesday, pointing out that the offshore yuan already jumped against the dollar earlier on Monday as a kneejerk reaction to the yen carry trade unravel.\n\nThe carry trade strategy involves borrowing Japan's longstanding ultra-low interest rate environment to fund higher-yielding assets elsewhere. The Bank of Japan's rate hike last week, however, jolted the market, forcing investors who borrowed to fund their carry trades to liquidate their positions, setting off the global market rout.\n\nNow, analysts and investors are jittery about the same happening in the Chinese yuan.\n\nChina is in a low interest-rate environment as authorities are trying to boost the country's flagging economy.\n\nCitibank strategists expressed such concerns in a client note, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. They wrote there are \"positioning worries in the funding side of the carry trade, and in particular the yuan.\" Business Insider was not immediately able to reach Citi for comment.\n\nANZ's Goh said Chinese exporters have been holding onto large amounts of dollar earnings that they had been unwilling to convert due to higher rates in the US. However, they may soon be doing so as the Fed readies to cut rates — which could create \"big moves\" in the markets.\n\nThe US dollar is trading around 7.17 to the offshore yuan now after falling to below 7.1 on Monday amid the market mayhem.\n\nChina's yuan — like the yen — is weak. But it has different problems.\n\nHowever, analysts don't seem to think the fallout from the yuan carry trade would be as tumultuous as the action in the yen.\n\nVishnu Varathan, the chief economist of Asia excluding Japan at Mizuho Bank, wrote in a note on Thursday that the yuan isn't the \"next big shoe\" to drop.\n\nThat is a \"somewhat misguided view,\" given that the yen — unlike the yuan — is a deeply liquid and global currency, added Varathan. In contrast, China still guides the Chinese currency's movements.\n\nChina also has different problems than Japan.\n\nWhile the yen's weakness is due to Japan's low interest rates, the yuan's weakness is mainly due to China's \"structural economic headwinds and daunting geo-political threats,\" wrote Varathan.\n\nChina is navigating a painful economic transition from a low-value manufacturing juggernaut to its push into the hot \"new three\" industries of electric vehicles, lithium batteries, and solar cells. However, it's facing rising geopolitical tensions, including high import tariffs from the US and the EU on such high-value industries.\n\nThis means that these geopolitical risks have to fade for the yuan to strengthen and cause an impactful unraveling of the carry trade like that for the yen earlier this week, he added.\n\nGoldman Sachs' analysts share these sentiments. In a note on Wednesday, they wrote that weak Chinese growth fundamentals mean any yuan rally should be limited.\n\n\"Still-elevated carry returns, weak domestic demand in China, and our expectation of continued monetary policy easing by the PBOC are likely to drive dollar-yuan back higher,\" the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.\n\nJPMorgan estimated on Wednesday that about three-quarters of global carry trades have been unwounded so far, per Bloomberg.\n\nThe yuan's risk is further depreciation, not strength\n\nChina's economy hasn't been able to take off convincingly since the country exited nearly three years of pandemic restrictions, so it's more likely that the People's Bank of China still needs to cut rates, wrote Varathan.\n\nTherefore, the yuan's risk is — unlike the yen — one of depreciation rather than appreciation, and a yuan meltdown could trigger risk-off sentiment in the wider market, added the economist.\n\n\"While excessive volatility either way is not desirable, we fear abrupt CNY meltdown more than we do sudden CNY strength,\" wrote Varathan, referring to the yuan.\n\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index was down 0.2% at 2:32 p.m. local time on Thursday.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi was down 0.7% while Taiwan's Taiex was down 2%.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index was 0.7% higher at midday and China's CSI 300 was up 0.3%.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

We start Tuesday trade near 7.2120. Monday lows in the pair came in\njust under 7.2050. USD/CNY finished up near the 7.1980 level.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Daily Market Outlook - Wednesday, Nov. 6Nov 06, 2024\n\nImage Source: Pixabay  \n\nThe results of the US presidential election indicate that Trump will emerge victorious and the Republican Party will maintain control of the Senate. The New York Times' closely-watched 'swingometer' projected a 93% chance of Trump winning, while Treasury yields rose to four-month highs as some betting sites significantly favoured him. However, the House of Representatives is still too close to call. Four years after departing the White House, Trump has advanced to the brink of a remarkable political revival by defeating Democrat Kamala Harris in the battleground states of North Carolina, Georgia & Pennsylvania. The euro, yen, and antipodean currencies have experienced declines as a result of the 1.5% increase in the US dollar index, which is the largest increase since March 2020. The dollar's sharp increase against the offshore yuan prompted reports that Chinese banks were selling dollars to slow the yuan's decline. China is perceived as being at the forefront of tariff risk, and its currency is currently trading at a high level of uncertainty, with implied volatility against the dollar circling record highs. As investors anticipate a meeting of top policymakers in Beijing this week to sanction local government debt refinancing and spending, Chinese markets have declined from an almost one-month high.\n\nEuropean stock futures were less ebullient due to the potential for a global trade war and the threat to EU exports if Trump's tariff policies are implemented. Additionally, there was a possibility that Trump could disengage from NATO, which would necessitate an increase in defence expenditures in Europe and would also serve to strengthen Russia's territorial ambitions.

That said, it remains at half the level\nseen in the 2020 presidential election in a sign that markets\nremained relatively sanguine.\n    \"The polls remain neck and neck even as some recent polling\nhas suggested that Harris has gained the upper hand,\" analysts\nat TD Securities said. \"Prediction markets have swung wildly on\nthe updated polling, but a Red Wave remains the most likely\noutcome priced into markets followed by Democratic President and\nsplit Congress.\"\n    MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS>\nclimbed 0.9%. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 Index <.SPX> rose 1%,\nthe Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> added 0.9%, and the\nNasdaq Composite <.IXIC> jumped 1.3%. [.N]\n    The 10-year Treasury yield <US10YT=RR> pared earlier gains\nto stand at 4.3110%, retreating from a four-month-high struck\nlast week. [US/] \n    Yields spiked higher earlier even as investors widely expect\nthe Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points\nwhen policymakers meet this week. The jump in yields followed\ndata from the Institute for Supply Management that showed U.S.\nservices sector activity unexpectedly accelerated in October to\na more-than-two-year high, as employment strengthened.\n    The two-year Treasury yield <US2YT=RR> added 3.6 bps to\n4.2138%, also near a three-month-high hit last week.\n    \"Investors are braced for turbulence in the Treasury market,\neven allowing for the big moves that we’ve already seen in it\nrecently,\" said John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital\nEconomics. The choppiness is not surprising, he said, given \"the\ncontrast in the protagonists’ policy platforms.\"\n    In general, investors have interpreted Trump's trade\npolicies to be more protectionist and inflationary.\n        \n    The 10-year Treasury yield has climbed 63 basis points\n     since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis\npoints on Sept. 18. \n  \n    Europe's benchmark STOXX index <.STOXX> was flat, while\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n<.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose 0.9%.\n    Currencies, which unlike shares trade around the clock, saw\nmore action, albeit offering only scattered and contradictory\nindications of which candidate investors were betting on.\n    The dollar, which eased as traders made final tweaks to\npositions, bought 151.58 yen <JPY=EBS> and changed hands at\n$1.0285 per euro <EUR=EBS>. [USD/]\n    \"They've priced what they think is price-able and that's\nthat,\" said Westpac strategist Imre Speizer, adding that a clear\nwin for Trump would lift the dollar, while a win for Harris\nwould push it a little lower.\n    Bitcoin <BTC=> added 3.3% to about $70,077, with Trump\nviewed by analysts as enacting more favorable policies for\ncryptocurrencies than Harris.\n    \"Ultimately the U.S. election comes down to this - whether\nthe U.S. electorate wants to vote for economic policy\ncontinuity, institutional stability and liberal democracy\n(Harris) or radical trade policy, a further retreat for\nglobalization and strongman democracy (Trump),\" J.P. Morgan\nanalysts said in a note. \"In short, a vote for stability or\nchange.\"  \n    \n    \n    BRACED\n    China is seen on the front line of tariff risk and its\ncurrency in particular is trading on tenterhooks with implied\nvolatility against the dollar <CNHSWO=> around record highs.\n    The yuan <CNY=CFXS> hovered at 7.1047 per dollar, while\nChinese stock markets surged to almost one-month highs as\ninvestors expect a meeting of top policymakers in Beijing this\nweek to approve local government debt refinancing and spending.\n    China's blue chip CSI300 <.CSI300> jumped 2.5% and Hong\nKong's Hang Seng <.HSI> rose 2.1%. [.SS]\n    The Australian dollar barely reacted after the central bank\nheld rates, as expected, with all eyes on the U.S. election, and\nthe Aussie <AUD=D3> was last marginally firmer at $0.6614.[AUD/]\n    Euro zone bond yields edged up, with Germany's 10-year bond\nyield <DE10YT=RR> climbing nearly 4 basis points to 2.431%, a\nlittle below last week's three-month high of 2.447%.\n    Oil held sharp overnight gains on delays to producers' plans\nfor increased output, leaving benchmark Brent crude futures\n<LCOc1> at $75.36 a barrel after a 3% rise on Monday.

In between, the company\nfrequently tapped the private placement market, mostly for short tenors and\njust a few 10-year or 30-year trades. \n\nMTR, which requires long term funding due to the nature of its business, came\nto the Dim Sum market after the Hong Kong government in July and Temasek\nHoldings in August both issued sizeable 10-year and 30-year bonds on the back\nof large order books.\n\n“Like all sophisticated issuers, they have been monitoring all the markets\nregularly, including US dollars, Hong Kong dollars and renminbi, while AAHK,\nthe Hong Kong government, Temasek, Swire and Prologis all had good response\nfrom the market, which gives all potential CNH issuers confidence in the depth\nof the Dim Sum market, especially the long end,\" said David Yim, head of debt\ncapital markets for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered. \n\nHaving come to the view that the Dim Sum market would be able to accommodate\nboth the tenor and the size it wanted, and offered the lowest absolute yield\namong the three currencies, MTR announced the deal on Monday.\n\nIt priced a Rmb3bn 10-year at par to yield 2.75% and a Rmb1.5bn 30-year at par\nto yield 3.05%, inside respective initial price guidance of 3.1% area and 3.4%\narea.\n\n\"The market for CNH is developing rapidly. The 30-year market has opened up\nclearly and meaningfully,\" said another banker on the deal.\n\nMTR also aimed to promote the green angle by tapping the public market. The\nbanker said the issuer had done green private deals before, but the leads\nrecommended a public deal for greater publicity. \n\nThere was uncertainty initially about the market response to a 30-year tenor,\nso the issuer put the focus on the 10-year tranche when it announced the\nmandate on Monday and said the 30-year would be dependent on reverse\nenquiries, in order to approach the deal \"step by step\", said the banker. \n\n\"The 10-year market is more established ... but the 30-year is a new market,\nsmaller but growing, so we wanted to get the right feedback,\" he said. \n\nInvestors showed strong interest for the 30-year tranche during the calls on\nMonday, convincing the leads to give them certainty and do a proper\nbookbuilding on the second day instead of reverse enquiries.  \n\nWith onshore yields compressed, many investors from mainland China are chasing\nafter higher yields in the offshore market. Bank treasuries, which used to be\nmore comfortable with short tenors, are now participating in 10-year notes,\nand with banks building good foundations for that tenor, funds have followed\ninto the 30-year space, which also attracts interest from insurers and\nofficial institutions. Even private banks joined MTR's 30-year tranche.  \n\n“We were pleasantly surprised so many investors participated … In the\nfast-developing CNH market, especially for tenors beyond 10 years, investors\nsimply don’t want to miss out any high quality, highly rated names,\" said\nYim.\n\nOrders for the 10-year tranche reached Rmb11.2bn, including Rmb3.06bn from the\nleads, from 95 accounts. Asia took 89% and EMEA 11%. Asset and fund managers\nand insurers accounted for 39%, banks 27%, official institutions and sovereign\nwealth funds 23%, and private banks and securities houses 11%. \n\nOrders for the 30-year bonds reached Rmb8.7bn, including Rmb1.37bn from the\nleads, from 85 Asian accounts.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is the US CPI Anti-Climactic?Aug 14, 2024\n\nOverview:Today's US CPI is the focus but the bar to a Fed cut next month is low, and it could prove anti-climactic. The more moderate inflation reading creates more space for the central bank to respond to signs of a continued slowing of the US labor market and adopt less restrictive policy. The dollar is mixed as the North American session gets under way. The rate cut by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, not a total surprise, but has seen fall 1%. A softer than expected UK CPI report is threatening to snap sterling's five-day advance. Firmer than expected Swedish inflation dampens talk of a 50 bp cut next week. This lifted the krona to the top of the G10 performers today. The euro set a new high since early January near $1.1030. A large set of options expire today slightly higher. Emerging market currencies are mostly firmer today, and the offshore yuan is at a six-day high.  News that Japanese Prime Minister Kishida will not see re-election had little market impact. \n\nEquities are mostly higher today. In the Asia Pacific region, China and Hong Kong were exceptions among the large bourses. Europe's Stoxx 600 is around 0.20% higher and is rising for the sixth session of the past seven. US index futures are little changed. Asia Pacific bonds rallied. In Europe, the low CPI readings saw 10-year Gilt yields drop four basis points, while the firmer CPI reading in Sweden saw its 10-year yield jump six basis points. Most of the benchmark yields in Europe are 1-2 bp higher. The 10-year US Treasury yield is flat near 3.84%. Gold remains firm near $2478. The record high was set last month around $2483. September WTI is pinned in the lower end of yesterday's range and holding above $78. The high set Monday was slightly above $80. \n\nAsia Pacific\n\nIn an otherwise quiet regional session, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand became the latest G10 central bank to begin its easing cycle.Even though swaps market favored a cut, economists leaned against it, the New Zealand dollar was sold on the news. The cash target rate now stands at 5.25% and the RBNZ sees it averaging 4.92% in Q4 and 4.36% in mid-2025. The economic calendar picks up tomorrow. Japan reports Q2 GDP, and everything is pointing to a recovery after the 0.7% quarter-over-quarter contraction in Q1. Consumption and business investment are expected to have rebounded. Net exports may have been a small drag, as was likely the inventory liquidation. Beijing appears to be downgrading the significance of the one-year Medium-Term Lending Facility Rate. It has brought the setting earlier, ostensibly distance it a bit from the setting of the loan prime rates (which will continue to be announced on the 20th of the month). It appears to be boosting the operational significance of the seven-day repo rate. The MLF rate will likely be left at 2.30%, after last month's reduction. The lending volume is expected to increase to CNY275 bln. This would be generous in the sense of providing more than the CNY103 bln that was expiring. China is also due to announce July real sector data. Retail sales are seen expanding sequentially, while industrial output slows marginally. The contraction in property investment may moderate but new and used home prices likely continue to fall. Australia's July employment report is due. Full-time employment jumped by 43.3k in June, following the 41.3k gain in May. In H1 24, Australia full-tome employment rose by an average of 34.4k a month, slightly better than H1 23. On the other hand, the unemployment has risen from 3.5% in June 2023 to 4.1% in June 2024, which partly reflects the increased participation rate (to 66.9% from 66.6%). \n\nThe soft US PPI helped push US yields lower yesterday and this seemed to weigh on the dollar against the yen.However, unlike what we have experienced recently, the yen's strength was more a reflection of broad dollar weakness than unwinding carry trades. Currencies and other instruments, like US stocks, on the other side of the carry trades did well yesterday. The greenback traded inside Monday's range against the yen (~JPY146.50-JPY148.20) but broke down to JPY146.10 earlier today before recovering to trade back above JPY147. Options for $1.15 bln at JPY 146.25 expire today. TheAustralian dollar settled yesterday near $0.6635, meeting the (61.8%) retracement objective of the sell-off from $0.6800 a month ago (found slightly above $0.6625).The five-day moving average crossed above the 20-day moving average by 1/100 of a cent on Monday and made a clear break yesterday. The Australian dollar traded at a marginal new high today, a little above $0.6640. There are around A$350 mln in options that expire today at $0.6670, but the next important chart area is around $0.6700.The broadly weaker greenback and the yen's strength helped the yuan strengthen yesterday.The dollar fell to six-day lows near CNH7.1400. If support is meaningful, the CNH7.1260-CNH7.1400 may offer it in the near-term. The fact that the offshore yuan is trading firmer than the onshore yuan, or at least spending more time above it suggests that the selling pressure is easing. The PBOC set the dollar's reference rate at CNY7.1415 (CNY7.1479 yesterday)\n\nEurope\n\nThe UK's July CPI was softer than expected and this weighs on sterling.The headline CPI fell by 0.2%, but given the 0.4% drop in July 2023, the year-over-year rate firmed to 2.2% from 2.0%. In the last three months, UK headline CPI rose at an annualized rate of 0.8%, which is less than half of the annualized paced in Q1 24. Core inflation ticked down to 3.3% from 3.5%. It has not risen since last May when it peaked at 7.1%. Service inflation slowed to 5.2% from 5.7%. It is the lowest since June 2022. The swaps market upgraded the probability of a BOE rate cut next month to about 43% from 36% yesterday, after delivering its first rate cut in a close vote on August 1. A November cut remains fully discounted. The odds of another cut in December have returned to nearly 100%, as it was on August 2, from less than 75% yesterday. Tomorrow, the UK reports Q2 GDP and details for June. The median forecast in Bloomberg's survey sees the economy stagnating in June (grow 0.4% in May after a flat April). \n\nYesterday was a good day for the euro.After initially being disappointed with the weak German ZEW survey, traders bought the euro on the dip (~$1.0915) and took it up to $1.10. It settled a slightly below $1.0995, for what appears to be its second best close of the year. The US two-year premium over Germany narrowed a few basis points to below 160 bp, where it remains today. The euro gains were extended to about $1.1030 so far today. Options for 1.6 bln euros at $1.1035 expire today and another batch of almost 1.5 bln euros at $1.10 expire Friday.Sterling's five-day advance is under threat. Its 0.70% rally yesterday was the most in three months, and the surge carried it through the (50%) retracement of the roughly 3 3/4-cent drop from July 17 through August 8. That retracement was near $1.2855. Sterling found initial support near $1.2820 today, but the intraday momentum indicators warn that the low may not be in place. The next chart support is in the $1.2780-$1.2800 area. \n\nAmerica\n\nThe focus is squarely on the US July CPI today.The July PPI, reported yesterday, was a little softer than expected with a 0.1% gain in the headline (2.2% year-over-year from a revised 2.7% in June) and a flat core reading (2.4% year-over-year from 3.0% in June). The median forecast in Bloomberg's survey projects a 0.2% rise in both in the headline and core CPI. The year-over-year pace may be flat at 3.0% for the headline, depending on rounding, while the core rate may tick lower to 3.2% from 3.3%. A 0.2% increase in the headline rate would translate to less than a 0.5% annualized rate over the last three months, down from 2.0% in the same year-ago period. Favorable base effects in August and September, when the headline CPI rose by 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively, in 2023 suggests the year-over-year pace will slow. The Fed will have August's CPI in hand (September 11) before it meets again (September 17-18). A 0.2% increase in the core CPI would put the three-month annualized rate at 2.0% down from 2.4% in the previous three months and 3.2% in the comparable 20023 period. The bar to a quarter-point cut in September seems low. We suspect it will take an exceptionally disappointing August jobs report to put a 50 bp cut truly on the table. \n\nThe broad setback in the US dollar and the risk-on mood helped lift the Canadian dollar yesterday after its six-day run ended with a minor loss on Monday.The greenback posted its lowest settlement since July 18. Like yesterday, today the US dollar approached but could not take out CAD1.3700, where options for about $500 mln expire today. Momentum indicators give scope for additional near-term US dollar losses, but the downside may be limited (~CAD1.3660-75?) before a consolidative/corrective phase.The dollar consolidated against the Mexican peso yesterday, giving by about 0.25% after gaining almost 1.30% on Monday.Even with last week's rate cut, Mexico's rates are still attractive, but the currency volatility makes it less so, especially for a market segment that may be reluctant to jump back into carry trades. From mid-July through early August, the dollar soared almost 15% against the peso. It has given back around 6% so far. The dollar is trading with a softer bias today and found initial support near MXN18.82. The recent low was near MXN18.77. Broad consolidation looks likely (~MXN18.60-MXN19.20?). \n\nDisclaimer \n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Reserve status\nand exchange rate value are two different things, of course, but\nthe comments seemed to bolster the currency nonetheless.\n    More immediately the 0.5% jump in the dollar index <.DXY> on\nMonday was driven largely by the relapse in the euro as markets\nassessed the risk of a collapse of the French government.\n    France's far-right National Rally will likely back a\nno-confidence motion against the government unless there's a\n\"last-minute miracle\", with lawmaker Marine Le Pen giving Prime\nMinister Michel Barnier until Monday to yield to RN's demands as\na part of protracted horse trading over the annual budget plan.\n    The euro <EUR=> fell almost a cent at one point first thing\non Monday before regaining a toehold above $1.05 and France's\nbenchmark CAC 40 <.FCHI> dropped more than 1%.\n    And yet French sovereign debt, in the eye of the storm,\nappeared calmer - with nominal 10-year yields <FR10YT=RR>\nfalling to their lowest in a month and premiums over German\nequivalents edging in from Friday's levels.\n    Part of the subsidence of borrowing costs is related to\nheightened expectations of European Central Bank easing as the\neuro wide economy struggles and German manufacturing activity\nshrinks amid auto sector woes, trade worries and election angst.\n    German bund yields <De10YT=RR> fell to their lowest since\nearly October, eyeing lows of 2% for the first time since\nJanuary. \n    But the other balm for French bonds was relief that Standard\n& Poor's on Friday held its rating on France's long-term\nsovereign debt steady at \"AA-\" and kept its outlook at stable.\n    And it wasn't just euro government yields on the retreat.\n    Despite more upbeat November business surveys from China\nthis weekend, which helped benchmark stocks indexes <.CSI300>\nthere outperform on Monday, intense speculation about further\neasing from the People's Bank of China saw 10-year yields\n<CN10YT=RR> dip below 2% for the first time on record - more\nthan 220 basis points below U.S. equivalents.\n    The move, as the PBOC tries to bring deposit rates offered\nby banks to brokerages and fund companies in line with its\nofficial 1.5% reverse repo policy rate, saw the offshore yuan\n<CNH=> fall to its weakest level since July.\n    Speculation is rife that China will respond to any renewed\ntariff hikes from an incoming Trump administration by allowing a\nweaker yuan, partly offsetting the impact on its exports to the\nUnited States.\n    But before we even get there, further restrictions on\nU.S.-China trade were due on Monday, with the U.S. due to launch\nits third crackdown in three years on China's semiconductor\nindustry - curbing exports to 140 companies including chip\nequipment maker Naura Technology Group <002371.SZ> among other\nmoves.\n    Back on Wall Street, the new week brings another critical\nsweep of labor market updates - now central to Federal Reserve\nthinking as it heads towards its final meeting of the year and\nafter unusual payroll weakness in October.\n    After several jobs market cuts through the week, Friday\nbrings the November employment report.

Title: GigaDevice Semiconductor's Expansion Plans Boost Investor Confidence In a move to strengthen its position in the rapidly growing semiconductor market, GigaDevice Semiconductor Inc has recently expanded its Arm MCU product roadmap through Arm Total Access. This strategic decision has not only piqued investors' interest but also boosted their confidence in the company's future prospects. As of yesterday's closing price, GigaDevice Semiconductor (GDS) stock has been trading at 65.51 Chinese Yuan (CNH), up from its 52 weeks low of 55.2 CNH recorded on February 4th, 2024. This significant increase in share value can be attributed to the company's consistent efforts towards expanding its product offerings and strengthening its presence in the industry. From a technical standpoint, GDS's current price of 65.51 CNH represents a substantial gain of 12.7% from its 52 weeks low. This uptrend is further reinforced by the relative strength index (RSI) which stands at 61.8%, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Moreover, GDS's price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) of 128.54 and price to book ratio (P/B Ratio) of 2.85 suggest that the stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. This presents an attractive buying opportunity for long-term investors looking to capitalize on the company's growth potential. Conclusion: GigaDevice Semiconductor's expansion plans and strong financial performance have undoubtedly caught the attention of investors, driving up the company's stock price. With a solid track record of delivering innovative products and a commitment to continued growth, GDS is poised for long-term success in the competitive semiconductor market.

It was last down 0.17% at $1.0864.\n    Sterling <GBP=D3> was steady at $1.2907, but was set for a\nfifth straight week of losses against the dollar. \n    This would be the longest such stretch since late 2018,\nfollowing the release of the UK government's first budget on\nWednesday that raised concern about the impact of high taxes,\nhigh spending and high borrowing on growth and inflation.\n    In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin, the world's largest\ncryptocurrency by market cap, was down 0.76% on the day at\n$69,397, having gained nearly 10% in October.\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates    https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Brigid Riley; Editing by Sonali Paul, Jamie\nFreed, Lincoln Feast and Barbara Lewis)\n ((brigid.riley@thomsonreuters.com;))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

The U.S. exchange rate index\nrebounded\n\nsharply, dragging down the offshore RMB to fall more than 600 points to 7.17.\nThe Hang\n\nSeng Index barely recovered 21,000 yesterday (5th). This morning everything\nwas taken\n\nback. As Trump's chances of winning gradually increased during the session,\nthe selling\n\npressure on Hong Kong stocks increased at 11 o'clock. Mainland China consumer\nstocks and\n\nthe domestic banks and insurance sectors led the decline. The Hang Seng Index\nfell by as\n\nmuch as 636 points and as low as 20,370 for half a day. It reported at 20,459,\ndown 547\n\npoints or 2.6%, crossing the 10-day moving average (about 20,561) and the\n20-day moving\n\naverage (about 20,591), and the main board turnover exceeded HKD 112 billion.\n\nThe Hang Seng China Enterprises Index reported at 7,341, down 214 points or\n2.8%. The\n\nHang Seng Tech Index reported at 4,551, down 142 points or 3%.\n\n\"Nip Chun Pong: Yesterday's transaction did not coordinate, the Hang Seng\nIndex makes a\n\nnormal correction today\"\n\nThe U.S. presidential election is in full swing. Although the counting of\nvotes is still\n\nin progress, Trump is clearly ahead for the time being. Hong Kong stocks\nresponded with a\n\ndecline. Nip Chun Pong, the Chief Strategist at Blackwell Global Securities,\ntold the ET\n\nNet News Agency that Hong Kong stocks were speculating on national policies\nyesterday,\n\nlooking forward to the central government launching RMB 10 trillion in\neconomic stimulus\n\nmeasures. The Hang Seng Index closed up more than 400 points yesterday, with\nChinese\n\nstocks rising more. Although the Hang Seng Index closed at 21,000 points\nyesterday, due to\n\nlack of coordination, only more than HKD 160 billion was traded, not even HKD\n170 billion.\n\nTo confirm the trend of the Hang Seng Index, at least HKD 200 billion was\nneeded.\n\nTherefore, today's correction of the Hang Seng Index is indeed a normal\nadjustment. The\n\nmarket is expected to remain within the range, with the resistance level\nremaining at\n\n21,000 points.\n\n\"Cryptocurrencies, traditional energy, and Chinese property stocks all\nbenefited\"\n\nIf Trump finally wins again, Nip Chun Pong believes that it will have little\nimpact on\n\nthe market, but it will have a profound impact on some sectors. The first is\n\ncryptocurrency. Trump has always embraced the cryptocurrency industry and it\nwill\n\nundoubtedly benefit. Currently, three asset management companies in the Hong\nKong stock\n\nmarket, including China Asset, Harvest Fund, and Bosera Funds, are allowed to\nissue\n\nBitcoin and Ether spot ETF products. Among them, ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF (03042)\nand ChinaAMC\n\nEther ETF (03046) issued by China Asset are more attractive.\n\nIn addition, Trump has always supported traditional energy, which is good for\n\noil-related sectors. The three barrels of oil in Hong Kong stocks can be\noptimistic. Among\n\nthem, PetroChina (00857) lagged behind in stock price and was the top choice\nfor three\n\nbarrels of oil.\n\nNip Chun Pong continued that Trump has always supported low-interest policies\nto promote\n\neconomic development during his previous term. If he comes to power again, he\nis expected\n\nto continue to cut interest rates. Interest rate cuts are good for technology\nstocks, and\n\nXiaomi (01810) and JD.com (09618) are expected to benefit. Among them,\nJD.com's\n\nprice-to-earnings ratio is low (the forecast price-to-earnings ratio is less\nthan 10\n\ntimes), which makes it very attractive.\n\nHowever, David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Chase, previously\nsaid that if\n\nTrump wins the U.S. election, the Federal Reserve may suspend its interest\nrate cut cycle\n\nas early as December because its expansionary fiscal policy will push up U.S.\ninflation.\n\n\"If Trump wins again, the Mainland China may increase its economic stimulus\nmeasures\"\n\nThere are rumours in the market that if Trump takes office again, the central\ngovernment\n\nwill increase its efforts to stimulate the economy. Nip Chun Pong pointed out\nthat if the\n\nmajor economic stimulus measures come true, Chinese insurance stocks, Chinese\nbank stocks,\n\nand Chinese real estate companies will all have the potential to rise. Among\nthem,\n\nproperty stocks have been hardest hit by the debt crisis in recent years, and\ntheir stock\n\nprices have fallen sharply since 2021. Therefore, the stock price is\nattractive at this\n\nstage.\n\nAmong them, Nip Chun Pong is optimistic about Longfor Group (00960), China\nVanke (02202)\n\nand Sunac (01918), which have greater upside potential. As for \"state-owned\"\nreal estate\n\ncompanies such as China Overseas (00688) and China Res Land (01109), they have\nbeen\n\ngreatly affected by the debt crisis and have seen relatively small declines in\ntheir stock\n\nprices in recent years. Therefore, their upside potential is not as good as\nthat of the\n\naforementioned private real estate companies.\n\nTrump's policies are said to be beneficial to the development of the U.S.\nbiotech\n\nindustry. WuXi bucked the market trend and rose early today. Is it also happy\nto see Trump\n\ncome on stage? Nip Chun Pong thinks it is difficult to draw a conclusion, but\nif Trump\n\nimposes import tariffs across the board in the future, the profits of export\ncompanies\n\nwill inevitably have pressure.\n\nAs for whether the price of gold will benefit from rising because of the\nuncertainty\n\nbrought about by Trump's coming to power and the financial market? Nip Chun\nPong believes\n\nthat this aspect may not have much relevance. On the contrary, Trump has never\nbeen keen\n\non war, and advocates that the Russia-Ukraine war should be resolved quickly.\nOn a certain\n\nlevel, it is to eliminate the uncertainty of the political situation. He does\nnot expect\n\ngold prices to have long-term rising potential."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tether (USDT) Discount Signals Surge in Chinese Stock Market InvestmentOct 07, 2024\n\nSince late September, Tether (USDT, Financial) has been trading at a discount to the US dollar, which experts suggest could indicate a rush among traders to buy Chinese stocks. As funds flow back into China's stock market, the cryptocurrency market, particularly USDT, has been experiencing significant declines.\n\nUSDT, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, theoretically maintains a value close to $1 USD. A discount from this value suggests that investors may prefer holding dollars or other more stable assets. Livio Weng, CEO of Hong Kong's cryptocurrency exchange Hashkey, pointed out that the eagerness of traders to convert assets back to Chinese yuan could infer a strategic move towards purchasing Chinese equities.\n\nOn Binance's peer-to-peer market, 1 USDT can be exchanged for between 6.78 to 6.98 yuan, while the offshore yuan to USD exchange rate has risen to around 7.09. This discount provides a potential arbitrage opportunity for investors to buy USDT with dollars, convert it to yuan, and invest in the Chinese stock market for potentially higher returns.\n\nAnnabelle Huang, managing partner at Singapore's Amber Group, observed a correlation between this phenomenon and the demand for onshore A-share trading. Brokerages in China have even extended their services during the national holiday to accommodate new account openings.\n\nThis investment interest is not limited to retail investors. Laura Vidiella del Blanco of New York-based MNNC Group noted that some institutional investors are also reallocating funds into Chinese stocks.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Not least with\nJuly 4's British election around the corner, the BoE is expected\nto stand pat for now - with a one-in-three chance of a cut at\nits next meeting on August 1 now seen in money markets. \n    Even though headline UK inflation hit the BoE's 2% target\nfor the first time in three years last month, 'core' rates\nremain well above 3% and services inflation is even stickier.\nThe BoE monetary policy committee is expected to be split 7-2 in\nfavour of holding rates - as it was last time around.\n    Sterling <GBP=> was a touch lower against the pumped up\ndollar ahead of the decision - but up against the euro\n<EURGBP=>.\n    In Europe, French stocks <.FCHI> were firmer and the French\ngovernment debt spread with Germany <FR10DE10=> steady after the\nEuropean Union warned on excessive French and Italian budget\ndeficits as expected on Wednesday - upping the ante into the\nsnap French parliamentary elections over the next month.   \n    Back on Wall St, Treasury yields <US10YT=RR> were a touch\nhigher into the re-open on Thursday - with housing data in focus\nbut also a keen eye on weekly jobless numbers to see if last\nweek's outsize jump was sustained.\n    The only number released during the \"Juneteenth\" market\nholiday on Wednesday was a weaker-than-forecast NAHB housing\nsentiment indicator for June.\n    In company news and deals, Britain's Tate & Lyle <TATE.L>\nfell 6.5% after the food ingredients maker said it will buy\nU.S.-based CP Kelco for $1.8 billion from J.M. Huber\nCorporation. \n    And UK bank NatWest <NWG.L> struck a deal to acquire most of\nthe banking business of retailer Sainsbury's <SBRY.L>, in a deal\nthat would increase the British lender's assets by 2.5 billion\npounds ($3.2 billion).\n    \nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S.\nmarkets later on Thursday:\n* Bank of England policy decision\n* US May housing starts/permits, weekly jobless claims, June\nPhiladelphia Fed business survey, US Q1 current account; Euro\nzone June consumer confidence   \n* San Francisco President Federal Reserve President Mary Daly\nRichmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and Minneapolis Fed chief\nNeel Kashkari all speak \n* Eurogroup meets in Luxembourg, with European Central Bank \nPresident Christine Lagarde and ECB board member Piero Cipollone\nattending\n* US corporate earnings: Accenture, Kroger, Jabil, Darden\nRestaurants, Smith & Wesson, Aurora Cannabis, Algoma Steel,\nMynaric \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nUK inflation returns to target for first time since 2021    https://reut.rs/3RWGXrp\nSwitzerland cuts interest rates for 2nd time this year    https://reut.rs/3Xyv0eS\nNvidia overtakes Microsoft as most valuable public company    https://reut.rs/3z3Y2sO\nNvidia eclipses Tesla as Wall Street's most traded company    https://reut.rs/45pBkaz\nJapan May exports rise on boost from weak yen    https://reut.rs/3VxwGTe\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (By Mike Dolan, editing by Editing by William Maclean\nmike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)\n ((mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com; +44 207 542 8488; Reuters\nMessaging: mike.dolan.reuters.com@thomsonreuters.net))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

This approach is seen as a prudent way to navigate the market while positioning for potential gains.\n\nThe financial experts at the brokerage, including Tony SK Lee, recommend options on large-cap indexes as a strategy to anticipate a rebound in Chinese stocks. They suggest specific strategies such as purchasing a narrow call spread on H-shares or FTSE China A50, and acquiring calls on Chinese equities, conditional upon the US dollar's performance against the Chinese offshore yuan.\n\nOptimism is growing regarding the global economic position of China, following the country's official manufacturing data hitting a yearly high. This positive trend, coupled with strong exports, increasing consumer prices, and a resurgence of foreign capital, alongside Beijing's commitment to market stabilization, has propelled the CSI 300 Index to a 11% rise from its February nadir.\n\nHowever, the strategists caution that, in light of the ongoing growth challenges facing China, re-entering the market based solely on the current economic improvements may be premature. They favor large-cap equities, especially those receiving support through corporate buybacks and investments from state-backed funds in China.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech trades -3.72 percent lower on Thursday 19th of SeptemberSep 19, 2024\n\nShanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech (688372.SS) traded down -3.72 % during a 24 hours period ending at 11:28 AM Central Europe on Thursday 19th. One Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech stock can currently be bought for about CNY 36.32 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech stocks is 113.8 mn. Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech has a current market capitalization of CNY 4.5 bn and approximately CNY 25.4 mn worth of Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech has traded -12.76 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 53.69. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 118.42 on 09/25/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 33.97 on 07/18/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: Shanghai V-Test Semiconductor Tech's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into Shanghai V-Test Semiconductor Tech (SVTS) may be scratching their heads after the latest quarterly results and fluctuating stock performance. Despite the lack of recent news, we can analyze the company's historical data to identify trends and patterns that might influence future growth. Priced at 37.08 CNY as of yesterday's close, SVTS has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the past year, with its 52-week high reaching 118.42 CNY on September 24th, 2023, and dipping to a low of 33.97 CNY on July 17th, 2024. This significant volatility suggests that investors have been uncertain about the company's long-term prospects. Looking at the company's Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, we find that it stands at an elevated 51.8819, indicating that investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of earnings. However, this could also suggest that the market expects strong future growth, which would justify the higher valuation. On the other hand, the Price to Book (P/B) ratio of 1.89442 indicates that investors are paying approximately twice the value of the company's book assets. While this could indicate undervaluation, it's essential to consider other factors before making any conclusions. SVTS's mixed signals continue when examining its chart pattern. After peaking in late September 2023, the stock experienced a sharp correction, falling by nearly 70% to reach its lowest point in mid-July 2024. Since then, the stock has recovered slightly but remains below its previous highs. This choppy price action suggests that investors are still trying to determine the company's true worth. To summarize, while there haven't been any recent developments regarding Shanghai V-Test Semiconductor Tech, our technical analysis reveals a complex picture of mixed signals. Investors must carefully evaluate the company's historical performance, financial ratios, and chart patterns to make informed decisions about whether to buy or sell SVTS shares.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Fujian Apex Software (603383.SS) traded up 0.52 % and now trades at CNH 25.97. Current market capitalisation for Fujian Apex Software is CNH 5.3 bn. Fujian Apex Software has a current price to earnings ratio of 24.04. Title: Fujian Apex Software's Strong Fundamentals Drive Growth Potential Investors looking for a promising investment opportunity may want to consider Fujian Apex Software Co Ltd (FAS), a software development company based in China. Despite the lack of recent news, the company's strong fundamentals suggest that it could be poised for growth in the long term. According to data from Finanzen.net, the last known news about FAS dates back to August 29th, when the company presented its quarterly results. As of September 11th, the stock has maintained a steady closing price of 25.51 CNH, with a 52-week high of 55 CNH reached on September 26th, 2023, and a 52-week low of 23.25 CNH recorded on August 28th, 2024. These figures indicate a relatively stable performance over the past year, with a slight upward trend. One key metric that stands out for FAS is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 24.49, which suggests that the market is undervaluing the company's earning potential. This is supported by the company's strong financial health, with a Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 4, indicating that the company's assets are worth significantly more than its current market value. While there have been no recent developments or announcements regarding FAS, the company's solid track record and strong financials make it an attractive investment option for those seeking long-term growth. With a history of stability and a promising future ahead, FAS could be a valuable addition to any portfolio.\n\n- Citic Niya Wine (600084.SS) traded down -2.95 % and now trades at CNH 4.79.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Oil plunges and OPEC disappears in the face of falling battery prices: Saxo Bank's eight black swans for 2025The global economy faces an uncertain and challenging future, where unpredictable events could drastically change the rules of the game. That's why Saxo Bank's economists, true to form, have compiled a list of black swans for 2025, those outlandish predictions that, while unlikely, could cause huge disruptions in markets, politics and everyday life. This year, projections range from a second term of Donald Trump dynamiting the hegemony of the dollar to unprecedented fiscal stimulus in China. They also highlight surprising technological breakthroughs, such as the printing of a human heart or the meteoric rise of Nvidia to double the value of Apple. They also put on the table a crisis in energy prices for data centers. However, among the most striking predictions is the rise of electric vehicles, which could lead to the demise of OPEC after a sharp drop in oil prices. In addition, Saxo Bank imagines extreme weather scenarios, such as a natural catastrophe that sinks a major insurer, or an unexpected turnaround in the British economy that would return sterling to its pre-Brexit strength.\n\nThe rise of electric vehicles (EVs) is radically transforming the global energy landscape, challenging even the industry's most influential institutions, such as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, puts this black swan: the possible irrelevance of OPEC in 2025, dragged down by the accelerating shift to electrified transport and the collapse of the oil price.\n\nOil sinks and OPEC 'dies'.\n\nThe terrifying scenario for the cartel and oil plays out as follows. China has led this revolution, shattering all projections for electric vehicle adoption. In 2021, Schroders, an asset manager with nearly $1 trillion under management, projected that EV sales in China would reach 5 million by the end of 2024, with a 15% market share. However, reality far exceeded these estimates: EV registrations in China exceeded 8 million as early as 2023, and by September 2024, EVs accounted for more than 45% of new car sales in the country, with annual growth of more than 40%. This progress, which has come six years ahead of schedule, has accelerated the transition to fossil fuel-free transportation.\n\nHansen notes that, with accelerated deflation in battery prices and a tipping point in EV costs relative to internal combustion vehicles expected in less than 12 months, global oil demand shockingly peaks in 2025. Given that roughly two-thirds of oil goes into gasoline and diesel for cars and trucks, the decline in their consumption will profoundly affect OPEC's relevance. With production quotas (imposed by the cartel to keep supply tight) becoming meaningless and the most dependent members facing drastic drops in revenue, the organization could crumble in the face of internal disputes and the departure of key members. This collapse would drive a significant drop in crude oil prices, profoundly altering the global energy market balance.\n\nFor Hansen, this scenario could benefit sectors such as air transport, the chemical industry, tire manufacturers and logistics companies, which would benefit from cheaper oil. However, he also warns that the market would quickly find a new equilibrium, as higher-cost producers, such as shale oil operators in North America, would shut down operations. Meanwhile, manufacturers such as the Japanese, traditionally reluctant in the transition to electric, would be forced to hasten their strategy to avoid being left behind in this new automotive order.\n\nThus, Hansen concludes that, although the future of oil remains uncertain, the unstoppable rise of electric vehicles is not only transforming the automotive industry, but could reshape the global geopolitical and economic balance. The question that arises is not whether change will come, but how fast it will happen.\n\nTrump blowing up the dollar\n\nThe Republican candidate's arrival in the White House has always been accompanied by a strong dollar. The powerful tariffs, tax cuts and the battery of measures brought back by the New York magnate always coincide in a greater power of the 'greenback'. However, at its moment of greatest appreciation, SaxoBank believes that it could lose its global crown and explode into a thousand pieces. The reason is that the global financial stress brought about by the new 'trade wars' already seen in its first stage could finally trigger the US's biggest enemies to make good on their threat and finally find an alternative... in cryptocurrencies and gold.\n\nJohn J. Hardy, a strategist at the firm, explains in this risky forecast that the precedents with Trump are quite clear. \"In 2016 he became the first president in living memory to attack the foundations of the global system, demanding tariffs on imported goods to correct the massive errors in the U.S. trade deficit.\" In that sense, they highlighted the confrontations first with neighboring Mexico, historical partners such as Japan and, the main course, China, whose 'trade war' marked his entire term in office and led to a phase one agreement, which is still where we are now. It also launched a tariff offensive against Europe, taking advantage of the WTO ruling against Airbus subsidies.\n\nFrom SaxoBank they believe that this 2025 we will experience something even stronger, for \"if 'Trump 1.0 was the warm-up act for de-globalization, Trump 2.0 will be the main event, with all its consequences for the US dollar\". Next year the US would completely overhaul its relationship with the world \"with massive tariffs.\" The answer may be very clear: \"The implications for the US dollar are dire for trade around the world, as it cuts off the necessary supply of dollars to keep the wheels of the global dollar system moving, which ironically risks a powerful rise in the US dollar.\"\n\nHardy points out that the biggest 'rebels' against the global dominance of the greenback, the Brics, would find an alternative in \"gold-backed digital money.\" They thus point to the \"offshore yuan\", while Europe would increasingly focus on the euro. The impact would be an unprecedented explosion in the cryptocurrency market, which would become the epicenter of the rebellion against the dollar, quadrupling in value to over $10 trillion. The dollar would sink 20% against the world's major currencies and 30% against the yellow metal, which would also become one of the pillars of the new global financial system.\n\nNvidia worth twice as much as Apple\n\nSo far the story of Nvidia and the momentum that AI has generated has been one of absolute free upside. Its chips have positioned themselves as some of the most likely to become the big stars within the infrastructure underpinning this technological revolution. This is already being transferred little by little to its profits, something that has generated the company to soar 188% so far in 2024 and 848% since 2023.\n\nThese aggressive rises have given Nvidia the opportunity to remain at the gates of the global equity throne, with a capitalization of $3.395 trillion compared to Apple's $3.621 trillion. At certain times, it has even been able to surpass the firm founded by Steve Jobs and proclaim itself the most valuable company on the planet. In this sense, this fever has generated a certain vertigo among analysts who have repeatedly asked themselves whether there will be a strong correction or, at least, how far this momentum has to go, what its ceiling will be.\n\nSaxoBank's answer is that there is no ceiling and that 2025 could confirm a totally historic turn in the markets. According to Hardy Nvidia would not only overtake Apple, but could double in size, consolidating this trend and marking a true global revolution. \"In 2025, Nvidia's success will be further boosted by the volume availability of its revolutionary 208 billion transistor Blackwell chip, a chip that increases AI compute performance per unit of power consumed by up to 25 times over the previous H100 generation.\"\n\nThe analyst strategist comments that no government wants to be left behind and that the famous Blackwells are the best tool in the face of power-hungry data centers. \"There will be an insatiable demand. Not only are they (their chips) more powerful, but they consume less energy, which will make Nvidia the most profitable company of all time.\" For its part, Apple itself and other similar firms will be affected by \"the need to launch huge investments to build huge data centers and not fall out of the AI race.\" In short, Nvidia's stock will be worth at least $250 (it now trades at $138), a figure that will come \"before markets begin to question its potential to turn that promise into profits and before potential competitive scrutiny worsens its prospects.\"\n\nA 'tax' on data centers with energy skyrocketing\n\nWithin AI one of the biggest symbols has been data centers. The need to set up these logistical centers for the new world of technology is catapulting numerous sectors. Faced with the gigantic demand for energy required by giants such as Microsoft, doomed nuclear power plants such as Three Mile Island, the scene of the biggest nuclear catastrophe until Chernobyl, have been reopened. This has boosted nuclear companies such as Vistra or Constellation, which are up 300% and 116% this year. Also nineteenth-century real estate firms such as Texas Pacific land, which is up 189% after learning that it will lease land for data centers near the Permian Basin gas production sources to supply them.\n\nAll of these stories that have taken over Wall Street's Olympus coincide in situating these data centers as the epicenter of a new technological era. In that sense, Ole Hansen, head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bamk explains that he expects these 'AI bases' to consume so much energy in 2025 that they will trigger prices in the US, forcing the White House to intervene urgently with specific taxes and other measures.\n\n\"In 2025, U.S. energy prices will skyrocket in several populated areas of the country as the largest tech companies rush to secure baseload electricity supplies for their prized AI data centers,\" Hansen comments. \"This inspires popular outrage as households see their utility bills skyrocket, compounded by huge increases in the prices of electricity consumed in the home during peak load periods at night.\" Specifically, the firm openly talks about gas prices more than doubling. Something that will also ignite inflation.\n\nThe response will be clear from the US, with \"many local authorities stepping in to protect political constituents, levying huge taxes and even fines on the largest data centers in an attempt to subsidize lower energy prices for households\". For their part, these high taxes and high prices \"will incentivize investment in huge new solar farms with load-balancing battery packs, but also in dozens of new natural gas-powered power plants.\"\n\nInsurers collapse in the wake of a Katrina 2.0\n\nClimate change is advancing by leaps and bounds. Last year saw wild weather events around the world, from a deluge that created temporary lakes in some of the driest parts of the Sahara, to deadly floods in Slovakia and Poland from overflowing rivers and in Connecticut and New York after a \"once-in-a-thousand-year\" rainfall event. Saxo Bank's Saxo Bank is positing a scenario of a catastrophic storm and rainfall in the US next year that will catch the insurance industry off guard and whose damages will more than multiply the $40 billion in claims related to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nIn the aftermath of this fateful natural disaster, one of the largest US insurers was found to have significantly underestimated weather risks, resulting in undervalued policies in the affected region. With insufficient reserves to cover claims and inadequate reinsurance to mitigate the costs of this extreme event, panic would quickly spread throughout the industry. This would eventually trigger a crisis that leads to discussions at the government level on whether to bail out the failed company and the other 'wounded' in the industry to avoid widespread risk contagion. Finally, the natural disaster forces a repricing of natural catastrophes, which drastically reduces property values in many real estate markets. Consumer confidence suffers as the value of many homeowners' greatest asset, their home, becomes insecure.\n\nOne derivative of this scenario drawn by Saxo Bank strategists is that shares in Berkshire Hathaway, the famous conglomerate of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, rise as the company has enough capital to weather the panic and the firm gains market share.\n\nA boom in the pound against a sinking euro\n\nAs growth succumbs in continental Europe, dragged down by a very weak Germany and France, new fiscal policy winds are blowing in the UK. The scenario drawn in this case by Saxo Bank analysts sees the newly arrived Downing Street Labour government moving to budget measures before 2025 that avoid raising the most growth-damaging rates of income tax while cutting less productive public sector spending to reduce deficits. By cutting unproductive subsidies such as winter allowances for pensioners, encouraging investment in the real estate and manufacturing sectors and boosting the incomes of public sector workers, the UK would be setting itself up for solid nominal growth in the coming years, with the Bank of England keeping the policy rate at a high level compared to its major global peers.\n\nThe other side of the coin is being seen in the aforementioned Germany and France. In Paris, a government of circumstances with the mission of putting the accounts in order announces increases in personal income tax and corporate tax that kill growth while the feared austerity is imposed. In Berlin, despite the fact that Germany remains \"the sickest of the sick in Europe,\" in the words of Danish bank strategists, the authorities are reluctant to finance desperately needed domestic investment in housing and infrastructure with debt that they could easily afford. Its old economic model of cheap Russian energy inputs to power its huge industrial base and manufactured exports is in ruins. And its non-luxury automakers have lost competitiveness due to high energy input costs and China seizing new battery technology for electric vehicles and taking a dominant global export share in the critical auto sector.\n\nWith these macroeconomic cards on the table, sterling reaches €1.27 next year, the level at which it traded before the Brexit referendum, erasing all of its post-Brexit vote discount. Encouraging domestic investment and stronger growth prospects are not only supporting sterling against the faltering euro, but the FTSE 100, the UK's benchmark stock index, is performing well.\n\nUndue stimulus in China\n\nChina's post-pandemic weakness may end up triggering dangerous inertia on a global scale. Saxo Bank economists envisage a situation in which the Asian giant is plunged directly into a classic balance-sheet recession similar to the Japanese experience of the 1990s. The country inflated a corporate and real estate debt bubble unparalleled in world economic history and that needs to be fixed. But the solution is never pleasant.\n\nIf the debt is written off, the economy deflates and the wealthy creditor class is crushed. If nothing is done, the country can remain in a malaise that will last for decades. If massive trade surpluses are generated for other countries to finance balance sheet repair, as China is already trying to do, there is a risk of provoking the wrath of other nations and trade wars, the Danish bank's experts argue.\n\nThe scenario chosen by Beijing in this alternative reality outlined by Saxo Bank is ambitious. China is boldly betting that reflation-artificially stimulating the economy-is the only answer and believes it can manage inflationary risks, while launching a mammoth set of fiscal initiatives totaling pledges of more than 50 trillion yuan (about $7 trillion) in 2025 and beyond.\n\nMuch of the spending goes directly into consumers' pockets through the digital yuan, so it will be injected directly into the economy rather than being used to pay down debt. China also adds heavy doses of social engineering to its stimulus, incentivizing companies to reduce working hours to improve quality of life. This boosts leisure time, consumption, business formation, family formation and childbearing.\n\nThe potential market impact would be a strong reflationary shock in China and the world, outperformance of emerging markets relative to developed markets, higher global commodity prices and a stronger Chinese yuan.\n\nThe medical breakthrough (Heart printers).\n\nThe year 2025 could mark a before and after in the history of medicine with a breakthrough that seemed straight out of science fiction: the bioprinting of a fully functional human heart. According to Saxo Bank economist and strategist Koen Hoorelbeke, this scientific breakthrough, achieved through advanced technology, could be a breakthrough in the history of medicine.3D printing technology promises to transform regenerative medicine and personalized healthcare. Based on high-resolution CT scans, researchers have designed a detailed digital model of the heart that serves as a blueprint for a state-of-the-art 3D printer. This technology uses human stem cells and biodegradable materials to build the organ layer by layer with amazing precision.\n\nThe process does not end with the printing of the organ. The bioprinted heart is placed in a specialized bioreactor that simulates the physiological conditions of the human body. Over several weeks, the organ matures, developing networks of blood vessels and electrical pathways essential for its proper functioning. In an unprecedented surgical intervention, this heart is successfully transplanted into a pig, reinforcing its viability as an alternative to conventional transplants. This breakthrough could solve the global organ shortage by creating personalized hearts, compatible with each patient's DNA, thus significantly reducing the risk of rejection.\n\nThe economic and scientific implications of this achievement are extraordinary. Hoorelbeke anticipates explosive growth in the biotechnology and 3D printing sectors, with a boom in IPOs of start-ups dedicated to this technology. Furthermore, this innovation opens the door to the bioprinting of other complex organs, revolutionizing regenerative medicine and improving patient outcomes worldwide. Although we are still in the early stages of this shift, the possibility of prolonging human life through bioprinted organs not only offers hope to millions, but also promises a significant impact on the global healthcare system and the economy as a whole."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

The euro, yen, and antipodean currencies have experienced declines as a result of the 1.5% increase in the US dollar index, which is the largest increase since March 2020. The dollar's sharp increase against the offshore yuan prompted reports that Chinese banks were selling dollars to slow the yuan's decline. China is perceived as being at the forefront of tariff risk, and its currency is currently trading at a high level of uncertainty, with implied volatility against the dollar circling record highs. As investors anticipate a meeting of top policymakers in Beijing this week to sanction local government debt refinancing and spending, Chinese markets have declined from an almost one-month high.\n\nEuropean stock futures were less ebullient due to the potential for a global trade war and the threat to EU exports if Trump's tariff policies are implemented. Additionally, there was a possibility that Trump could disengage from NATO, which would necessitate an increase in defence expenditures in Europe and would also serve to strengthen Russia's territorial ambitions. Aside from US political developments, macro events that could potentially impact markets on Wednesday include: Services within the Eurozone Producer prices for September and PMIs for October. September industrial orders in Germany. Services provided by the United States PMI for October.  \n\nOvernight Newswire Updates of Note\n\n * Trump Wins The Critical Battleground State Of Pennsylvania \n * PBoC Affirms Supportive Monetary Policy\n * Japan PM Ishiba Preps Meeting With Biden, China’s XI\n * Japan PMI, Confidence Shrinks On Softer Sales\n * UBS Pushes Back RBA First Rate Cut Forecast To May 2025\n * NZ Unemployment Rate Rises Less Than Forecast\n * Hong Kong Stocks Slide, Traders Pare Risky Bets\n * US Stock, Yields Rise As Markets Await Election Outcome\n * Nvidia Rides AI Wave Past Apple As World largest Company\n * Crypto Surge To Record Levels On Early Trump Lead\n * Spike In UK Borrowing Cost Wipes Out Fiscal Headroom\n *           (Sourced from reliable financial news outlets)\n\n \n\nFX Options Expiries For 10am New York Cut \n\n(1BLN+ represents larger expiries, more magnetic when trading within daily ATR)\n\n * EUR/USD: 1.0650 (3.9BLN), 1.0700 (686M), 1.0725 (1.5BLN)\n * 1.0750 (900M) 1.0800 (2.4BLN)\n * USD/CHF: 0.8675 (241M), 0.8700 (1.4BLN), 0.8800 (289M)\n * EUR/GBP: 0.8390-0.8400 (621M)\n * GBP/USD: 1.3000 (331M)\n * AUD/USD: 0.6475 (689M), 0.6510 (728M), 0.6525 (817M)\n * AUD/NZD: 1.1010 (397M), 1.1100 (300M)\n * USD/CAD: 1.3800 (555M), 1.3875 (420M), 1.4025 (267M), 1.4050 (442M)\n * USD/JPY: 153.50 (728M), 155.65 (350M)  \n\nCFTC Data As Of 1/11/24\n\n * Net USD G10 long +$8.88bn to +$18.7bn in Oct 23-29 IMM period; $IDX +0.13%\n * EUR +0.17%: speculative positions decreased by 21.8k contracts, now at -50.3k, lower ECB view weighs on EUR\n * JPY +1.55%; speculative positions decreased by 37.6k contracts, now at +25k, on hawkish Fed, less dovish BoJ\n * GBP +0.27%; speculative positions decreased by 8.2k contracts, now at +66.4k; less-dovish BoE lends support.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "On Tuesday 24th of September Shenzhen Hopewind Electric trades -0.36 percent lowerSep 24, 2024\n\nShenzhen Hopewind Electric (603063.SS) traded down -0.36 % during a 24 hours period ending at 10:40 PM Central Europe on Tuesday 24th. One Shenzhen Hopewind Electric stock can currently be bought for about CNY 11.55 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Shenzhen Hopewind Electric stocks is 444.4 mn. Shenzhen Hopewind Electric has a current market capitalization of CNY 5 bn and approximately CNY 58.1 mn worth of Shenzhen Hopewind Electric was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Shenzhen Hopewind Electric has traded -5.02 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 18.93. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 25.83 on 03/12/2024. 52 weeks low was at CNY 11.08 on 09/20/2024.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Henan Dayou Energy (600403.SS) traded up 0.81 % and now trades at CNY 2.65. Henan Dayou Energy has a market capitalisation of CNY 5.9 bn.\n\n- Cwb Automotive Electronics (605005.SS) traded up 0.34 % and now trades at CNY 14.91. Cwb Automotive Electronics has a market capitalisation of CNY 6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Cwb Automotive Electronics is 23.27. Title: CWB Automotive Electronics: Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain a foothold in the booming automotive electronics market may want to take a closer look at CWB Automotive Electronics Co Ltd (CWEB), a Chinese firm that has been making waves with its innovative technology solutions. Despite a lack of recent news, a technical analysis of the company's performance paints a mixed picture of its potential. Current Price and Past Performance As of September 24th, 2024, CWEB's last closed price stood at 14.9 CNY, down from its 52-week high of 24.59 CNY recorded on November 28th, 2023. However, this decline has not deterred investors, as the stock has still seen significant growth over the past year, with a 52-week range of 11.3 CNY to 24.59 CNY. This volatility suggests that the company's future performance could be influenced by various factors, including changes in consumer demand and technological advancements. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio One key metric that investors often consider when evaluating CWEB's performance is its price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio). Currently standing at 23.27, this figure indicates that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its peers, suggesting that investors have high expectations for the company's future earnings growth. Additionally, CWEB's price to book ratio (P/B ratio) of 3.28221 implies that the stock is undervalued based on its assets, which could be an attractive opportunity for value investors. Technical Indicators When examining CWEB's chart patterns, several technical indicators provide insights into the company's short-term and long-term prospects. For instance, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 61.8%, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal remains bullish, with a positive crossover hinting at continued upward momentum. However, the Stochastic Oscillator reveals that the stock is approaching overbought territory, which could lead to a correction or consolidation period in the near future. Conclusion While CWEB's recent lack of news may raise concerns among investors, a technical analysis of the company's performance highlights both positive and negative signals. With a premium P/E ratio and undervalued P/B ratio, the stock appears to be attractively priced for those willing to take on some risk. However, the stock's volatility and approach to overbought territory suggest caution may be warranted before jumping into the fray. As such, investors should carefully weigh these factors before making any decisions regarding their investment strategy.\n\n- Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion (603583.SS) traded down -1.48 % and now trades at CNY 15.67. Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion has a market capitalisation of CNY 5.9 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is 18.89. Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Jadard (688252.SS) traded down -2.35 % and now trades at CNY 14.41.

With a P/E ratio of 38.0438, Jadard's stock appears to be undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. Additionally, the P/B ratio of 3.10563 suggests that the company's shares are significantly cheaper than its net assets, making it an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the technology sector's potential for long-term growth. Looking ahead, Jadard's commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction bodes well for its future prospects. As the company continues to expand its offerings and reach new markets, investors can expect sustained growth and potentially significant returns on their investments. Conclusion: Jadard Technology Inc's latest financial results demonstrate a promising outlook for the company's future growth. With a strong track record of performance and a dedication to innovation, Jadard presents an attractive investment opportunity for those seeking exposure to the rapidly evolving technology sector.\n\n- Zhejiang Lante Optics (688127.SS) traded down -0.07 % and now trades at CNY 15.28.

Headline: Technical Analysis: KPC Pharmaceuticals Inc (KPC) Shows Promising Growth Potential Investors may be keeping a close eye on KPC Pharmaceuticals Inc (KPC), as the stock has been exhibiting strong growth potential despite the lack of recent news. According to sources, the last known news regarding KPC dates back to January 23rd, 2024, with a headline that reads \"昆药集团：KPC-149口服溶液临床试验申请获受理\" (KPC-149 Oral Solution Clinical Trial Application Approved). However, this news has had little impact on the stock's performance, suggesting that investor sentiment remains positive. Looking at the charts, KPC has been trending upwards over the past year, with a 52-week high of 24.11 CNH on May 5th, 2024, and a 52-week low of 11.92 CNH on September 17th, 2024. This indicates that the stock has experienced significant growth over the past year, with a gain of approximately 21% between its highest and lowest points. Additionally, the stock's current price of 15.75 CNH represents a discount of around 30% compared to its 52-week high. From a technical standpoint, KPC appears to be trading within a well-established uptrend, with support levels at 11.92 CNH and resistance levels at 24.11 CNH. This suggests that the stock may continue to experience upward momentum in the near future, particularly if it can break through its resistance level and reach new heights. Furthermore, the stock's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 26.59 and price-to-book ratio (P/B) of 2.16 indicate that it may be undervalued relative to its peers, providing an attractive entry point for investors looking to capitalize on its growth potential. Overall, while there may be limited news surrounding KPC at present, the stock's strong historical performance and promising technical outlook suggest that it could be a compelling addition to any portfolio. As such, investors may wish to keep a close eye on KPC and consider initiating or adding to positions as opportunities arise.\n\n- Weaver Network (603039.SS) traded up 3.93 % and now trades at CNY 47.98.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "China cuts lending rates to revive economy and stabilize housing marketOct 20, 2024\n\nChina has reduced its benchmark lending rates in an effort to stimulate economic growth and address a struggling housing market.\n\nThe one-year loan prime rate (LPR) was lowered to 3.10% from 3.35%, while the five-year LPR was cut to 3.60% from 3.85%.\n\nThese moves follow a series of monetary easing measures introduced by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in late September.\n\nThis latest reduction exceeds the expectations of economists, who had predicted a smaller 20-basis point cut across both lending rates.\n\nInstead, the size of the cuts, ranging from 20 to 25 basis points, aligns with previous statements by PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng, suggesting a more aggressive approach to monetary easing.\n\nTargeting borrowing and market stabilization\n\nThe LPR is set by a consortium of major Chinese banks and serves as a key reference point for the pricing of loans.\n\nMost new and existing loans are linked to the one-year LPR, while the five-year rate plays a critical role in determining mortgage costs and other long-term loan pricing.\n\nThe reductions come as part of a broader strategy to encourage households and businesses to borrow more by lowering interest rates and increasing liquidity.\n\nThese measures are intended to boost lending, halt the property market’s decline, and ultimately restore economic momentum.\n\n“The larger cuts confirm the PBOC’s commitment to faster monetary easing and reflect the Politburo’s recent push for more forceful rate cuts,” said Beckly Liu, head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered Plc.\n\nYuan and bond markets react with stability\n\nFollowing the announcement, the offshore yuan remained stable at around 7.12 per dollar.\n\nMeanwhile, China’s 30-year government bond yield remained unchanged at 2.3% amid low trading volumes. The muted market reaction suggests that the rate cuts were largely anticipated.\n\nChina’s top policymakers had earlier emphasized the importance of revitalizing the property market, which plays a crucial role in the country’s economy.\n\nIn a Politburo meeting held in September, officials vowed to implement substantial interest rate reductions and introduce measures to prevent further deterioration in the real estate sector.\n\nBruce Pang, chief economist for Greater China at Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., noted that the larger-than-expected cuts signal the government’s determination to stabilize the housing market.\n\nFurther easing measures likely\n\nThe PBOC has indicated that additional monetary easing could be on the horizon.\n\nGovernor Pan Gongsheng hinted at the possibility of another reduction in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 25 to 50 basis points by year-end to increase bank lending capacity.\n\nThough further interest rate cuts are not expected this year, analysts believe the PBOC could act more aggressively if unexpected economic shocks arise.\n\nChina’s largest state-owned lenders also reduced their deposit rates last week, a move intended to mitigate the impact of lower loan rates on bank profit margins.\n\nA pivotal moment for China’s economy\n\nThe recent rate cuts mark another step in China’s effort to navigate a challenging economic landscape. As the property market faces headwinds and consumer sentiment remains fragile, the government hopes these measures will reinvigorate borrowing and spending.\n\nWhile the PBOC’s actions aim to maintain stability in financial markets, economists caution that their effectiveness will depend on consumer and investor confidence.\n\nWith additional policy tools at its disposal, the central bank may have to balance further easing with long-term financial stability.\n\nThe post China cuts lending rates to revive economy and stabilize housing market appeared first on Invezz"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

However, apart\nfrom JPY, implied volatility in other currency pairs remains near recent and\n2-year lows, so not expecting the Fed narrative to prompt a significant\nrepricing of the policy outlook. \n    The Bank of England policy announcement isn't expected to fuel much in the\nway of additional FX volatility, but markets aren't ruling out increased CHF\nvolatility after the Swiss national bank announcement early Thursday.
