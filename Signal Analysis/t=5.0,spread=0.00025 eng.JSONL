Yet, charts suggest yuan sellers should proceed cautiously.\n\nThe daily USD/CNH chart is flashing signs that the rally has exhausted itself and consolidation lower is ahead.\n\nWednesday's doji candlestick signalled indecision as buyers met offers lurking before major technical resistance levels. Thursday's pullback, which importantly, was preceded by the doji, may have affirmed a top.\n\nThe descending 100-day moving average at 7.2414 now coincides with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the April-September rally, creating a formidable chart barrier. A retreat to where the 55 DMA meets the 200 DMA, near 7.1850, could play out as Chinese FX authorities muscle the onshore market via spot intervention as well as much stronger daily yuan benchmarks.\n\nIn the near-term, USD/CNH may gyrate in a 7.1625-7.2410 range, demarcated by the 38.2% and 23.6% Fibonacci lines. But that zone could narrow as the 100 DMA and 200 DMA converge toward the psychological watermark of 7.2000, which might be a level that Beijing is defending in the onshore USD/CNY.\n\nWhile punters may try shorting the yuan on the chance of a cut to the one-year loan prime rate on Monday, a trimming of the five-year mortgage reference rate seems more likely.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Extinction of autonomous bodies, on standbyThe administrative reform which is part of Andrés Manuel López Obrador's Plan C and which intends to eliminate seven autonomous bodies is on a sort of stand by.\n\nDespite the fact that this reform was approved by the Constitutional Points Commission of the Chamber of Deputies on August 28, it is not on the legislative agenda in the few days remaining before the end of López Obrador's government and in which the initiative for the National Guard to be officially integrated into the Ministry of Defense will be approved in fast track and with the steamroller of Morena and allied parties.\n\nIt seems that it was President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum who managed to stop this administrative reform to give priority to the judicial reform, but the doubt is whether it will only be a postponement and will be dealt with in this same ordinary period or in the next, or if the disappearance of the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) will really be reversed, the Federal Economic Competition Commission (Cofece), the National Institute for Transparency, Access to Information and Protection of Personal Data (Inai), the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE), the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH), the National Commission for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (Coneval) and the National Commission for the Continuous Improvement of Education (Mejoredu).\n\nINCREASED UNCERTAINTY AND TRADE DISPUTES\n\nWhat is least convenient for Sheinbaum is to generate greater uncertainty among investors with the disappearance of autonomous bodies at the beginning of her administration.\n\nIn the case of the IFT and Cofece they would give rise to controversies in the framework of the T-MEC when one of Sheinbaum's priorities in 2025 will be the revision of the treaty; while the disappearance of the Inai would be a serious setback in terms of transparency and governance and it is an absurdity that the government becomes judge and party before the demands for information on the government's business at all levels of government.\n\nAnd in the case of Coneval, the allies of the 4T should be the first to be interested in the continuation of an independent body that evaluates the application and efficiency of social programs, because what is measured can be improved.\n\nAs for the CRE and the CNH, since the beginning of the six-year term, they lost their independence and became de facto subordinated to the Sener. It should be remembered that since the morning, López Obrador made life impossible for Guillermo García Alcocer to force him to resign as president of the CRE.\n\nFED TO LOWER RATES TODAY\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank will hold its monetary policy meeting today, and the doubt among analysts is whether it will lower rates by 25 or 50 basis points.\n\nAnalysts' bet that rates will be lowered is the reason why markets remain optimistic in the United States and why the dollar has depreciated against the main international currencies, including the peso. Yesterday, the interbank dollar closed at 19.12 pesos compared to the 20.08 pesos it traded at last week before the approval of the judicial reform.\n\nIn the case of Mexico, the decision of the monetary policy meeting of Banxico's Board of Governors will be announced on Thursday, September 26, and it is expected that -regardless of the Fed's decision- the majority will opt to lower rates by 25 basis points."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

One Founder Securities stock can currently be bought for about CNH 6.94 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Founder Securities stocks is 8.2 bn.

The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 10.24 on 11/10/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 6.18 on 02/06/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Founder Securities\n\nTitle: Founder Securities' Financial Performance Remains Stable Despite Lack of Recent News Investors looking for stable financial performance may find Founder Securities Co Ltd (FSC) an attractive investment opportunity, despite the lack of recent news. According to the latest available data, FSC has maintained a consistent price trend with minimal fluctuations over the past year. As of September 16th, 2024, FSC closed at 6.85 Chinese Yuan (CNH), just slightly below its 52-week high of 10.24 CNH reached on November 9th, 2023. This indicates that the stock has been trading within a relatively narrow range, suggesting stability in the company's financial performance. Looking back at the previous quarterly results, FSC reported a solid balance sheet with a price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) of 27.36 and a price to book ratio (P/B Ratio) of 1.21, according to the latest available data from finanzen.net. These ratios indicate that FSC's shares are currently undervalued compared to its earnings and book value, which could be an attractive entry point for potential investors. While there have been no recent updates on FSC's financial performance or business developments, the company's historical track record suggests a stable financial foundation. With a strong balance sheet and a proven ability to maintain a consistent share price, FSC may be worth considering for long-term investment strategies. However, it is important to note that the absence of recent news may also indicate a lack of significant changes or developments within the company. As such, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. Nonetheless, for those seeking stable financial performance and undervalued shares, FSC may present an intriguing opportunity.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Orient Securities -China (600958.SS) traded up 0.71 % and now trades at HKD 8.55. Current market capitalisation for Orient Securities -China is HKD 67.6 bn.

Title: Technical Analysis: China CITIC Bank Corp Ltd (OTCMKTS:CHCJY) Trends and Outlook Investors looking for opportunities in the financial sector may want to take a closer look at China CITIC Bank Corp Ltd (OTCMKTS:CHCJY), which has been trending upwards in recent months. As of September 11th, 2024, the stock closed at 4.4 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), just shy of its 52-week high of 5.23 HKD reached on July 2nd, 2024. This marks a significant improvement from the 52-week low of 3.41 HKD seen on November 12th, 2023. Looking at the technical indicators, CHCJY's relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at 58.47, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) line is bullishly inclined, with the MACD line above the signal line, suggesting that the uptrend is likely to continue. Additionally, the stock's price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) of 3.56 and price to book ratio (P/B Ratio) of 0.27311 indicate that it is undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. Despite the lack of recent news, investors may be encouraged by the positive trend in CHCJY's stock price. However, it is important to note that the banking sector is highly sensitive to economic conditions and geopolitical events, so any unexpected changes could impact the stock's performance. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Tbea (600089.SS) traded up 1.01 % and now trades at CNH 12.08. Current market capitalisation for Tbea is CNH 60.5 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Tbea is 8.02. Title: TBEA's Latest Launch Fails to Boost Stock Price Despite Strong Fundamentals In a recent development, TBEA Co Ltd (TBEA) has launched a new 1,500V string inverter, marking another milestone in the company's innovation journey. However, despite this positive move, the stock price has failed to respond, remaining stagnant in recent times. As of now, the last closing price of TBEA stands at 12.43 CNY, down from its 52-week high of 16.76 CNY recorded on March 5th, 2024. Despite the lackluster performance in the stock market, TBEA's fundamentals remain strong. The company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) currently stands at 8.22792, indicating that investors are willing to pay 8.23 times the company's earnings per share. Additionally, the price-to-book ratio (P/B Ratio) is 1.09479, suggesting that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. From a technical standpoint, TBEA's stock has been trading within a narrow range between 12.06 CNY (52-week low) and 16.76 CNY (52-week high). The stock has been consolidating below the 50-day moving average (MA), which could be an indication of weakness in the short term. However, the relative strength index (RSI) remains above 50, implying that the stock is still in a bullish territory. If the stock breaks out above the 50-day MA, it could trigger a rally towards the 52-week high of 16.76 CNY. On the other hand, a breakdown below the 12.06 CNY support level could lead to a decline towards the next support level at 10.44 CNY. Conclusion: While TBEA's latest launch has failed to boost the stock price, the company's strong fundamentals suggest that there may be value in investing in the long run. Technically speaking, the stock is trading within a tight range, and a breakout or breakdown could determine the near-term direction. Therefore, investors should keep a close eye on TBEA's movements and consider entering into a long position if the stock breaks out above the 50-day MA.\n\n- Ningbo Deye (605117.SS) traded down -0.6 % and now trades at CNY 92.4. Ningbo Deye has a market capitalisation of CNY 60.4 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Ningbo Deye is 32.13. Title: Ningbo Deye Technology: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Investors looking to gain exposure to China's booming technology sector may want to take a closer look at Ningbo Deye Technology Co Ltd (NDTC), but a technical analysis of the company's assets paints a mixed picture. According to data from Finanzen.net, the last known news on NDTC dates back to August 28th, with the stock closing at 85.88 CNH. While this may suggest a lack of recent activity, the company's performance over the past year tells a different story. On July 24th, NDTC reached a 52-week high of 104.79 CNH, representing a significant increase from its 52-week low of 39.65 CNH on December 12th, 2023. This volatility has resulted in a price to earnings ratio of 29.94 and a price to book ratio of 7.21, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for the company's growth potential. However, the stock's current price of 85.88 CNH represents a decline from its previous close, raising concerns about the company's short-term prospects. Additionally, the lack of recent news may indicate a lack of momentum or interest in the company, which could impact its future performance. Despite these mixed signals, NDTC remains an attractive option for investors seeking exposure to China's tech industry. With a strong track record of growth and a solid balance sheet, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging trends and technologies. However, investors should exercise caution and closely monitor developments before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank (601825.SS) traded up 1.06 % and now trades at CNH 6.87.

The VIX <.VIX> 'fear index' hit its highest of the year on\nTuesday too at 19.56 - coincidentally the average of the past 35\nyears since the index's inception.\n    Although a Goldman Sachs beat on Monday lifted its stock and\ncontrasted to a shaky start to the season for the big banks, the\naggregate annual profit growth estimate for S&P500 companies has\nfallen to 2.7% for Q1 from as much as 5% at the start of the\nmonth and more than 7% at the start of the year. \n    Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are among the big names\nreporting later on Tuesday.\n    The mix of rate worries, earnings and geopolitics saw the\nS&P500 lose more than 1% again on Monday to its lowest in almost\ntwo months, although futures were steadier ahead of today's\nbell. The Russell 2000 of small cap stocks <.RUT> fell 1.4% and\nis now negative for the year to date.\n    Bourses across Asia and Europe were down more than 1% on\nTuesday too. \n    With Middle East tensions simmering, U.S. crude oil prices\n<CLc1> held steady about $85 per barrel. Gold prices <XAU=>\nslipped back further from Friday's record high.\n\nKey diary items that may provide direction to U.S. markets later\non Tuesday:\n* US corporate earnings: Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Bank\nof New York Mellon, Northern Trust, PNC, Omnicom, Johnson &\nJohnson, UnitedHealth, United Airlines, JB Hunt     \n* German Chancellor Olaf Scholz meets with China's President Xi\nJinping and Premier Li Qiang in Beijing\n* US March industrial production, housing starts/permits.

The surge in dollar selling by Chinese companies could intensify in the short term, potentially triggering a \"stampede\" that further boosts the yuan. The rising expectations of US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts also contributed to the yuan's appreciation. Over the month, the offshore yuan is on track to gain nearly 2%, marking its best performance since December 2023.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Baidu (BIDU) Stock Rises Amid AI and Cloud Innovations Despite Economic ChallengesSep 27, 2024\n\nChinese stocks surged, with the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index closing up nearly 11% on Thursday, marking its largest intraday gain since March 2022. The offshore yuan also briefly broke the 7-to-1 barrier against the dollar. This was driven by a series of unexpected policy moves from China, leading foreign institutions to reassess their view of Chinese assets. Scott Rubner, Managing Director at Goldman Sachs Global Markets, noted the recent strong performance of Chinese stocks and stated that Chinese equities should be a key component of investors' plans once the U.S. elections conclude.\n\nOn Thursday, Baidu (BIDU, Financial) shares soared. At the time of writing, the stock was up 9.09%, trading at $102.56.\n\nProduct and Technology – The Driving Force Behind Baidu’s Rise\n\nBaidu announced major updates to its AI and cloud products at the 2024 Baidu AI Cloud Summit in Beijing. The upgrades include the Baige AI Heterogeneous Computing Platform 4.0 and the Qianfan Foundation Model Platform 3.0. According to Dou Shen, Baidu’s EVP, the Ernie AI model now handles more than 700 million daily queries on the Qianfan platform. The company also mentioned that Baige 4.0 achieves over 99.5% training efficiency on a cluster with 10,000 GPUs and can manage clusters of up to 100,000 GPUs.\n\nBaidu’s AI coding assistant, Baidu Comate, introduced new features helping programmers review code and architecture. Comate serves over 10,000 enterprise clients. Additionally, Baidu's AI-driven customer service platform Keyue autonomously resolves 90% of queries, handling 1.5 billion queries in total.\n\nLast week, Alibaba (BABA) also unveiled over 100 open-source AI models at its annual cloud event, Apsara. China's cloud services market is fiercely competitive, with major players like Baidu, Alibaba, ByteDance (BDNCE), Tencent (TCEHY), and iFlytek cutting prices for their large language models (LLM).\n\nMaintaining Stability in a Complex Environment: A Long-term Test for Baidu\n\nBased on its Q2 2024 report, Baidu's revenue estimate for 2024 has been downgraded from $19.35 billion to $19.08 billion. Analysts now project a slight slowdown in 2025 growth due to uncertainties in Baidu’s core online marketing amid a challenging macroeconomic environment. However, analysts remain optimistic about Baidu’s AI Cloud and Apollo Go (self-driving robotaxi) businesses, projecting a 7.5% annual growth rate over five years.\n\nIn terms of profit margins, Baidu’s trailing twelve months (TTM) free cash flow (FCF) margin is around 26-27%. Despite increasing profit margins, analysts maintain a 25% FCF margin assumption for a safety buffer in their models.\n\nFor Q2 2024, Baidu posted mixed results: revenue of $4.67 billion, slightly below market expectations of $4.74 billion, largely due to a 2% annual decline in core online marketing revenue. The macroeconomic environment has weakened digital advertising demand, affecting Baidu further as it integrates its ERNIE-driven GenAI into core products.\n\nManagement reported that 18% of all search queries in Q2 were answered by generative AI, leading to fewer searches and monetization challenges. Despite this, Baidu's leadership aims to transition from a cost-per-sale (CPS) to a cost-per-click (CPC) model for better profitability in the GenAI era.\n\nIn addition to its focus on AI Cloud, which grew 14% annually in the last quarter, Baidu seeks to enhance user experience over short-term monetization. Even though Q2 performance was mixed, AI Cloud's acceleration helped maintain slight positive revenue growth. CEO Robin Li emphasized that AI Cloud mitigated the ongoing headwinds in online marketing, contributing to Baidu's core revenue growth.\n\nOn the operational front, analysts believe Baidu’s updates to its search platform, although impacting short-term monetization, will drive long-term success. Apollo Go now offers fully autonomous ride-hailing services across Wuhan, with plans for expanded testing of its latest RT6 vehicles.\n\nBaidu's AI innovations are increasingly impactful across various sectors. CFO Rong Luo stressed the importance of AI-native product transformation and operational optimization for sustained profitability.\n\nIn Q2, Baidu launched ERNIE 4.0 Turbo, expanding its GenAI model series. Its autonomous ride-hailing service, Apollo Go, reported 899,000 rides, up 26% annually, and began offering 100% fully autonomous operations in Wuhan. Baidu projects its robotaxi business will break even in unit economics in the coming years.\n\nDespite economic challenges, Baidu (BIDU, Financial) remains a strong buy according to analysts, with recent valuations suggesting a fair value estimate of $199 per share. The company’s robust balance sheet, with $37 billion in cash and investments against $10 billion in debt, supports a positive long-term outlook.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

The U.S. exchange rate index\nrebounded\n\nsharply, dragging down the offshore RMB to fall more than 600 points to 7.17.\nThe Hang\n\nSeng Index barely recovered 21,000 yesterday (5th). This morning everything\nwas taken\n\nback. As Trump's chances of winning gradually increased during the session,\nthe selling\n\npressure on Hong Kong stocks increased at 11 o'clock. Mainland China consumer\nstocks and\n\nthe domestic banks and insurance sectors led the decline. The Hang Seng Index\nfell by as\n\nmuch as 636 points and as low as 20,370 for half a day. It reported at 20,459,\ndown 547\n\npoints or 2.6%, crossing the 10-day moving average (about 20,561) and the\n20-day moving\n\naverage (about 20,591), and the main board turnover exceeded HKD 112 billion.\n\nThe Hang Seng China Enterprises Index reported at 7,341, down 214 points or\n2.8%. The\n\nHang Seng Tech Index reported at 4,551, down 142 points or 3%.\n\n\"Nip Chun Pong: Yesterday's transaction did not coordinate, the Hang Seng\nIndex makes a\n\nnormal correction today\"\n\nThe U.S. presidential election is in full swing. Although the counting of\nvotes is still\n\nin progress, Trump is clearly ahead for the time being. Hong Kong stocks\nresponded with a\n\ndecline. Nip Chun Pong, the Chief Strategist at Blackwell Global Securities,\ntold the ET\n\nNet News Agency that Hong Kong stocks were speculating on national policies\nyesterday,\n\nlooking forward to the central government launching RMB 10 trillion in\neconomic stimulus\n\nmeasures. The Hang Seng Index closed up more than 400 points yesterday, with\nChinese\n\nstocks rising more. Although the Hang Seng Index closed at 21,000 points\nyesterday, due to\n\nlack of coordination, only more than HKD 160 billion was traded, not even HKD\n170 billion.\n\nTo confirm the trend of the Hang Seng Index, at least HKD 200 billion was\nneeded.\n\nTherefore, today's correction of the Hang Seng Index is indeed a normal\nadjustment. The\n\nmarket is expected to remain within the range, with the resistance level\nremaining at\n\n21,000 points.\n\n\"Cryptocurrencies, traditional energy, and Chinese property stocks all\nbenefited\"\n\nIf Trump finally wins again, Nip Chun Pong believes that it will have little\nimpact on\n\nthe market, but it will have a profound impact on some sectors. The first is\n\ncryptocurrency. Trump has always embraced the cryptocurrency industry and it\nwill\n\nundoubtedly benefit. Currently, three asset management companies in the Hong\nKong stock\n\nmarket, including China Asset, Harvest Fund, and Bosera Funds, are allowed to\nissue\n\nBitcoin and Ether spot ETF products. Among them, ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF (03042)\nand ChinaAMC\n\nEther ETF (03046) issued by China Asset are more attractive.\n\nIn addition, Trump has always supported traditional energy, which is good for\n\noil-related sectors. The three barrels of oil in Hong Kong stocks can be\noptimistic. Among\n\nthem, PetroChina (00857) lagged behind in stock price and was the top choice\nfor three\n\nbarrels of oil.\n\nNip Chun Pong continued that Trump has always supported low-interest policies\nto promote\n\neconomic development during his previous term. If he comes to power again, he\nis expected\n\nto continue to cut interest rates. Interest rate cuts are good for technology\nstocks, and\n\nXiaomi (01810) and JD.com (09618) are expected to benefit. Among them,\nJD.com's\n\nprice-to-earnings ratio is low (the forecast price-to-earnings ratio is less\nthan 10\n\ntimes), which makes it very attractive.\n\nHowever, David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Chase, previously\nsaid that if\n\nTrump wins the U.S. election, the Federal Reserve may suspend its interest\nrate cut cycle\n\nas early as December because its expansionary fiscal policy will push up U.S.\ninflation.\n\n\"If Trump wins again, the Mainland China may increase its economic stimulus\nmeasures\"\n\nThere are rumours in the market that if Trump takes office again, the central\ngovernment\n\nwill increase its efforts to stimulate the economy. Nip Chun Pong pointed out\nthat if the\n\nmajor economic stimulus measures come true, Chinese insurance stocks, Chinese\nbank stocks,\n\nand Chinese real estate companies will all have the potential to rise. Among\nthem,\n\nproperty stocks have been hardest hit by the debt crisis in recent years, and\ntheir stock\n\nprices have fallen sharply since 2021. Therefore, the stock price is\nattractive at this\n\nstage.\n\nAmong them, Nip Chun Pong is optimistic about Longfor Group (00960), China\nVanke (02202)\n\nand Sunac (01918), which have greater upside potential. As for \"state-owned\"\nreal estate\n\ncompanies such as China Overseas (00688) and China Res Land (01109), they have\nbeen\n\ngreatly affected by the debt crisis and have seen relatively small declines in\ntheir stock\n\nprices in recent years. Therefore, their upside potential is not as good as\nthat of the\n\naforementioned private real estate companies.\n\nTrump's policies are said to be beneficial to the development of the U.S.\nbiotech\n\nindustry. WuXi bucked the market trend and rose early today. Is it also happy\nto see Trump\n\ncome on stage? Nip Chun Pong thinks it is difficult to draw a conclusion, but\nif Trump\n\nimposes import tariffs across the board in the future, the profits of export\ncompanies\n\nwill inevitably have pressure.\n\nAs for whether the price of gold will benefit from rising because of the\nuncertainty\n\nbrought about by Trump's coming to power and the financial market?

For all of 2024, a total easing of 65 basis points has been\npriced in. \n    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China set\nthe midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed\nto trade in a 2% band, at 7.1321 per dollar, 1,385 pips firmer\nthan a Reuters estimate.    \n    The central bank has been gradually lowering its daily yuan\nofficial guidance - albeit well within market projections - with\na bias suggesting it is allowing some depreciation, traders and\nanalysts said. \n    \n\n (Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom; Editing by Jamie Freed and\nSubhranshu Sahu)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

Welcome to\nAsia Markets Briefing. I'm Thomas Warner. The Japanese and Chinese currencies\nhit two-week highs against the Dollar on Monday. FX traders pointed to a poll\nover the weekend that showed Democrat Kamala Harris taking a surprise\nthree-point lead in the swing state of Iowa. Growing confidence in a Trump win\nhad seen the Dollar index rally to a three-month high in October. With the\nelection due on Tuesday, it's likely to be a rocky few days in the currency\nmarkets. One-week implied volatility for the offshore Yuan is at its highest\nsince 2015, when China cut the value of its currency after a stock market\nrout. But the Indian Rupee fell to its weakest level on record on Monday. It's\nbeen hit by persistent outflows from local stocks. The NIFTY 50 suffered its\nbiggest daily drop in four weeks on Monday, persistent selling by overseas\ninvestors and a tepid earnings season means that the index is now down 9% from\nSeptember's record highs. The Culture Day national holiday in Japan and that\nno trading happened on the Nikkei. Korean and Chinese markets all made gains\nwith BYD leading the gains in Hong Kong. Shares in the car maker surged after\nit reported a 67% year-on-year increase in production and a 12% rise in Q3\nprofits. It's also hiring close to 200,000 new employees to help with\nmanufacturing. The bullish update gave a lift to the entire Chinese auto\nsector. China's Commerce Minister Wang Wentao met with French Junior Trade\nMinister Sophie Primas in Shanghai on Sunday. He urged Paris to take a\nâactive role in ending the escalating trade war between China and the\nEU.â Primas is on a three-day visit to challenge China over its import\nduties on Brandy, which Paris calls âpolitical and unjustified.â\nLooking ahead to the rest of this week now, and the Standing Committee of\nChina's National People's Congress is meeting until Friday.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "SHANGHAI, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Having spent all year\ntrying to put a floor under the tumbling yuan, China's central\nbank is suddenly faced with the opposite problem and is turning\nto subtle ways to stop the currency from appreciating sharply.\n    The usually restrained yuan <CNY=CFXS> has strengthened 1.3%\nagainst the dollar in August, recouping nearly all its losses in\nthe first half of the year. On Friday, it looked set for its\nfifth straight weekly gain, the longest winning streak in more\nthan three years.\n    While none of the underlying drivers at home, namely a weak\neconomy and capital flight, has changed, the yuan has been\nhelped by growing bets for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts,\nwhich are weakening the dollar, and by a rally in the Japanese\nyen.\n    Meanwhile, Chinese authorities have worked behind the scenes\nto ensure the currency doesn't spike abruptly, which could roil\nfragile domestic financial markets and hurt exporters. They have\nsurveyed the market to gauge the pressure, and quietly relaxed\nrestrictions on imports of gold and trading positions in the\nyuan for some banks.\n    \"The government is probably less concerned about\ndepreciation but remains wary of FX volatility,\" said Gary Ng,\nsenior economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis.\n    \"While the pressure on the yuan may ease as the Fed may\nfinally cut interest rates, there may be sudden and significant\nmovements in capital flows.\"\n        One big reason for the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to\nbe worried is the build-up of speculative short yuan positions\nduring the currency's steady decline since early 2023, which\ncould be unwound messily if the currency rises fast. \n        Foreign companies operating in China, domestic exporters\nand  investors have swapped yuan for dollars to earn better\nreturns in what is known in market circles as the yuan carry\ntrade.  \n        Analysts at the Macquarie Group estimate exporters and\nmultinational companies have accumulated foreign currency\nholdings of more than $500 billion since 2022.\n    \"As the yuan appreciates... concerns about the potential\nunwinding of yuan carry trade and shocks to financial markets\nmay arise,\" said Zhu Chaoping, global market strategist at J.P.\nMorgan Asset Management.\n    \"Recent market volatility in Japan might have reminded\npolicymakers about these risks.\"\n    China's currency regulator, the State Administration of\nForeign Exchange (SAFE), and the PBOC did not immediately\nrespond to Reuters requests for comment.\n        \n  \n    \n    PREVENT A STAMPEDE\n        Possibly to get an idea of pent-up yuan buying that\ncould come as the currency appreciates, SAFE surveyed banks\nabout their clients' FX conversion ratio - the proportion of\nrevenues exporters convert into yuan - last week, two people\nwith direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n    \"FX settlement is the issue that everyone in the market is\nmostly concerned about, besides the Fed rate cut,\" said Liu\nYang, general manager of the financial market business\ndepartment at minerals exporter Zheshang Development Group.\n    \"After all, exports are the only major driver of China's\neconomy among its traditional 'troika' (traditional growth\nengines), and regulators do not want the yuan to appreciate\nrapidly and substantially to weaken the competitiveness of\nexport products,\" he said.\n        Separately, guidance given to banks last year banning\nthem from keeping short yuan positions at the end of a day's\ntrading has also been relaxed for some banks, two people with\ndirect knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n    Chinese banks have also been given new gold import quotas by\nthe central bank, Reuters reported. Gold imports are usually\ncurtailed when the yuan faces depreciation pressures.\n    The measures are subtle, analysts said, and together with\nthe trend in the PBOC's daily benchmark guidance setting for the\nyuan, simply point to a desire to contain volatility, rather\nthan thwart gains.\n    Still, market participants are revising their yuan\nforecasts. \n    Analysts at BofA Securities expect the yuan will continue to\nweaken, \"given subdued growth and PBOC's easing bias\", but see\nthe yuan at 7.38 per dollar by year-end, not 7.45 as they had\npreviously forecast.

One possible reason behind this rally could be investors' renewed confidence in the company's ability to navigate the challenging shipping industry. Although the arbitration proceedings may pose a short-term risk, YZJ's strong fundamentals and proven track record suggest that the long-term outlook remains positive. From a valuation perspective, YZJ's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 9.99, indicating that the market has priced in expectations of robust future growth.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "1\n\n25 March 2024\n\nShort week ahead looks quieter than last\n\nCentral banks dominated the news flow last week, with the Reserve Bank of\nAustralia (RBA), Bank of Japan, US Federal Reserve, Bank of England and the\nSwiss National Bank all meeting. Some policy changes were made (SNB cut and\nthe BoJ tightened) and other central banks tweaked forward guidance. Here NZ's\nQ4 2023 GDP contraction was the main event. The Easter week ahead is a quieter\none, with the US PCE data of note offshore.\n\nGlobal sharemarkets ended mixed on Friday. In the US, the NASDAQ gained 0.2%\nbut the S&P500 and Dow eased modestly from their record highs. In Europe the\nUK's FTSE gained 0.6% on Friday, while the French CAC-40 was down 0.3%. Asian\nshares were similarly mixed with Japan's Nikkei 225 up 0.2%, while the Chinese\nindices were in the red, and Australia's sharemarket was down 0.1%. The NZ\nsharemarket hit an eight-month high on Friday, boosted by an earnings upgrade\nfrom Fisher & Paykel Healthcare. The S&P/NZX 50 Index lifted 0.5% on turnover\nof $114 million (\n(https://www.goodreturns.co.nz/article/976522946/nz-sharemarket-gets-wake-up-prod-thanks-to-fisher-paykel.html)read\nmore\n(https://www.goodreturns.co.nz/article/976522946/nz-sharemarket-gets-wake-up-prod-thanks-to-fisher-paykel.html))\n(https://www.goodreturns.co.nz/article/976522946/nz-sharemarket-gets-wake-up-prod-thanks-to-fisher-paykel.html).\n\nCentral bank speak: ECB Governing Council member Joachim Nagel spoke last\nweek. With inflation set to return to the 2% target in 2025, the probability\nis increasing that there'll be a first cut \"before the summer break\" in\nAugust, the Bundesbank president commented. ECB President Christine Lagarde\nmade similar remarks on Wednesday, saying officials can't commit to further\nsteps following June's likely cut. Meanwhile in the US, Federal Reserve Bank\nof Atlanta President Raphael Bostic says he now projects just one\ninterest-rate cut this year, adding that reduction will likely happen later in\nthe year than he previously expected (Source Bloomberg).\n\nFX: The NZD starts the week sub-0.6000, trading near 0.5990 this morning. The\nNZD is also trading back below the\n\n0.92 handle against the AUD, trading near 0.9185 this morning. USD/CNH rose\nsharply by almost 0.7% to 7.2640 during the Asian session on Friday. The jump\noccurred just after the PBOC's daily fixing was set a touch higher than in\nrecent weeks at 7.1004. The market may have interpreted this as a sign that\nthe PBoC will tolerate a weaker currency. The sharp lift in USD/CNH had an\noutsized impact on AUD and NZD. Friday was quiet locally, with small moves\n(1-2bps). The offshore rally was a little stronger, with the US 10-year Govt\nyields down 7bps. That should set the tone this morning in NZ.\n\nOil prices eased lower on Friday, with a strong USD helping the move, with\nWest Texas Intermediate trading around $81 US per barrel overnight.\n\nDay ahead: no local data due, and nothing is expected offshore until Tuesday.\n\nWeek ahead local: On Wednesday and Thursday ANZ releases their latest Business\nOutlook and Consumer Confidence reports. ANZ business confidence has largely\nmaintained its post-election jump, despite ongoing headwinds facing\nbusinesses. We expect past activity measures will largely remain consistent\nwith subdued economic growth. We expect consumer confidence will remain weak\nrelative to historical averages. Pressures facing households remain acute,\nincluding an elevated cost of living and a softening labour market.\n\nWednesday's NZ 2024 Budget Policy Statement will provide a stocktake of the\neconomic outlook, and outline the government's broad fiscal goals, including\noperating and capital allowances to be ahead of the May 30 Budget. Priorities\nare likely to include tax cuts, assessing value for money from operational\nspending, and investment. The tax cut package looks set to go ahead, although\nthe size and shape of the package will need to be cognisant of fiscal\nrealities.\n\nWeek ahead offshore: In Australia, the latest consumer sentiment figures are\nout tomorrow, the monthly CPI indicator is out Wednesday, and February retail\ntrade data out Thursday. The CBA Household Spending Insights data suggested\nweakness across the month, with a small pocket of spending driven by a large\nnumber of concerts not enough to outweigh softness in areas such as household\ngoods.\n\nElsewhere it is relatively quiet with the US PCE data the only major release\nof note. The core PCE deflator is a preferred inflation gauge in the US for\nthe FOMC. Our CBA colleagues estimate a strong 0.3% lift in February both due\nto shelter and healthcare costs.\n\nAuthor:                       chris.tennent-brown@asb.co.nz\n\nASB Economics | 649 301 5657 |\n\nPlease refer to the important disclosures at the end of this document\n\n25 March 2024\n\n Currencies                 Currencies                                         Commodities                      Equities                \n NZD/USD     0.5992  0.0%   NZD/SEK                6.356   0.3%                NZX WMP           3050.0  0.8%   Dow       39476  -0.8%  \n NZD/AUD     0.9184  -0.2%  NZD/DKK                4.136   0.0%                Gold $/o          2165.4  -0.7%  S&P 500   5234   -0.1%  \n NZD/EUR     0.5558  0.2%   NZD/THB                21.8    2.5%                WTI Oil $/b       81.0    -0.6%  NASDAQ    16429  0.2%   \n NZD/JPY     90.97   0.3%   AUD/USD                0.6524  0.2%                Money Market (%)          FTSE   7931      0.6%   \n NZD/GBP     0.4777  0.4%   EUR/USD                1.081   0.0%                90 Day BB         5.64    0.00   CAC-40    8152   -0.3%  \n NZD/CAD     0.8153  0.0%   USD/JPY                151.4   0.0%                OCR               5.50    0.00   DAX       18206  0.1%   \n NZD/CHF     0.5378  -0.1%  10 Yr Bond Yields (%)          ASB Swap Rates (%)                    H.Seng  16499  -2.2%     \n NZD/HKD     4.687   0.0%   NZ                     4.54    0.01                1yr               5.34    -0.01  Nikkei    40888  0.2%   \n NZD/SGD     0.8082  -0.1%  US                     4.20    -0.07               2yr               4.84    -0.01  ASX200    7771   -0.1%  \n                                                                                                                                        \n NZD/CNH     4.360   0.0%   Aust                   4.04    -0.06               5yr               4.32    -0.02  NZX50     11979  -      \n\n ASB Economics & Research                                                      Phone           Fax             \n Chief Economist           Nick Tuffley         nick.tuffley@asb.co.nz         (649) 301 5659  (649) 302 0992  \n Senior Economist          Mark Smith           mark.smith4@asb.co.nz          (649) 301 5657                  \n Senior Economist, Wealth  Chris Tennent-Brown  chris.tennent-brown@asb.co.nz  (649) 301 5853                  \n Senior Economist          Kim Mundy            kim.mundy@asb.co.nz                                            \n Economist                 Nat Keall            nathaniel.keall@asb.co.nz      (649) 301 5915                  \n Future Me Graduate        Jordan Campbell      Jordan.campbell@asb.co.nz                                      \n Administration Manager    Caro Phillips        caro.phillips@asb.co.nz                                        \n\nhttps://reports.asb.co.nz/index.html                    ASB Economics\n\nASB North Wharf, 12 Jellicoe Street, Auckland\n\nImportant Disclaimer\n\nThis document is published solely for informational purposes.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Offshore Yuan Hits One-Year LowThe offshore yuan weakened to around 7.3 per dollar, reaching a one-year low, pressured by increased bets on further rate cuts amid lackluster growth in China, compounded by US tariff risks. Recent data showed a modest improvement in manufacturing activity, while services activity came in weaker than expected, suggesting the need for further policy support. This aligns with PBOC Governor Pan's recent signal of year-end rate cuts and plans to boost countercyclical measures next year. Additionally, escalating trade tensions put further pressure on the yuan. On Monday, the US announced new restrictions on China's access to key components for chips and AI, while over the weekend, Trump reiterated his threat to impose 100% tariffs on BRICS nations, which included China. The yuan also continued to face downward pressure from a strengthening US dollar, driven by recent robust US economic data."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Chinese yuan softens, USDCNY at 7-mth high on weak fix, trade jittersInvesting.com-- The Chinese yuan softened on Tuesday, with the main USDCNY dollar pair hitting a seven-month high after a weak midpoint fix by the People's Bank, while concerns over a trade war with the West were also in play.\n\nThe yuan's USDCNY pair, which gauges the number of yuan required to buy one dollar, rose as much as 0.1% to 7.2628- its highest level since mid-November.\n\nInitial weakness in the yuan came after the People's Bank of China set a weaker midpoint rate for the currency from Monday. The fix came amid mounting selling pressure against the yuan, as sentiment towards China soured.\n\nThe offshore yuan was much weaker, with the USDCNH pair rising past 7.28, also hitting a seven-month high.\n\nWhile the PBOC has so far attempted to maintain some stability in the yuan against recent selling pressure, the currency's latest bout of weakness suggest that the central bank may have no choice but to let the yuan depreciate in the near-term.\n\nThe PBOC has so far kept a tight hold on the yuan through the midpoint fix and market operations. It had reportedly intervened in currency markets earlier this year to brace the yuan against a bout of selling pressure.\n\nBut sentiment towards China soured substantially in recent weeks, especially as Beijing flagged the possibility of a trade war over import tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles by the U.S. and the European Union.\n\nEuropean tariffs were a key point of contention for China, given that the region is a major market for local EV makers. Chinese automakers were also seen calling for retaliatory tariffs on European vehicle imports.\n\nChinese and German ministers met this week to discuss the tariffs, which are set to be imposed in July.\n\nAdding to concerns over a trade war, Canada was also seen potentially joining the U.S. and EU in imposing curbs on Chinese EVs, which are seen as providing stiff competition to local automakers.\n\n?

That\nfollows lower-than-expected inflation data published on Monday,\nhighlighting still weak domestic demand. \n    By 0352 GMT, the yuan <CNY=CFXS> was 0.05% lower at 7.1179\nto the dollar after trading in a range of 7.1170 to 7.1258.\n    \"China’s economy continues to show diverging trends with\nweak domestic demand and strong export competitiveness, both\nreflecting the domestic deflationary pressure,\" said Zhang\nZhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. \n    Meanwhile, the dollar continues to recover as investors\nreduced their bets on an outsized rate cut from the Federal\nReserve next week, after mixed U.S. job reports. \n    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China set\nthe midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed\nto trade in a 2% band, at 7.1136 per dollar, 4 pips firmer than\na Reuters' estimate.\n    The yuan is down 0.4% against the dollar this month, and\n0.2% weaker this year. It has been under pressure since early\n2023 as a prolonged property crisis, anaemic consumption and\nfalling yields drive capital flows out of yuan, and foreign\ninvestors stay away from China's struggling stock market.\n    Adding to the worries are escalating trade tensions, The\nU.S. House of Representatives on Monday passed a bill that aims\nto restrict business with China's WuXi AppTec, BGI and several\nother biotech companies on national security grounds.\n    While recent lacklustre data and mounting trade worries are\nraising calls for more policy easing to revive China's economy,\nAlexander Redman, chief equity strategist at CLSA, said China's\ncentral bank is facing a difficult balancing act. \n    China wants more settlement of international trade in\nRenminbi, \"it is difficult to convince your trade partners to do\nthat if your currency is weakening as a result of aggressive\ninflationary policy,\" he said. \n    \n    LEVELS AT 0351 GMT \n    \n INST  CURR  UP/D  %     DAY'  DAY'\n RUME  ENT   OWN(  CHAN  S     S \n NT    vs    -)    GE    HIGH  LOW\n       USD   VS.

The franc, a\ntraditional safe haven, was also trading at a seven-month high. \n    High-yielding currencies such as the Indian rupee <INR=IN>\nand Mexican peso <MXN=> tumbled, while currencies that had\nhitherto been used for funding investments, such as the yen and\nChina's yuan <CNH=>, rallied.     \n    Treasury yields have been falling quite sharply since last\nweek, when the Federal Reserve kept the policy rate in its\ncurrent 5.25% to 5.50% range while Chair Jerome Powell opened\nthe possibility of a rate cut in September.\n    But by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate had\njumped, expectations for rate cuts deepened.\n    Japanese stocks collapsed on Monday in their biggest single\nday rout since the 1987 Black Monday sell-offs.\n    The euro was up 0.3% at $1.0944 <EUR=EBS> against a\nbroadly-weaker dollar.\n    Expectations for European Central Bank (ECB) rate cuts have\nalso risen. Traders now see more than 90 basis points of rate\ncut from the ECB this year, versus 50 bps a week ago.  \n    \"This is a position unwind and since the National Assembly\nelection was called in France, no one's been long euros,\" Kit\nJuckes, head of FX Strategy at Societe Generale said, referring\nto the euro's slide in June after a snap election was called in\nFrance. \n    \"The euro will be capped by rate and growth expectations but\nprobably range-bound as a result.\"\n    \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates    https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\nFX moves 10 days    https://tmsnrt.rs/4dpFKRs\nGraphic-US unemployment rate     https://tmsnrt.rs/3piciFu\nGraphic-US inflation and interest rates    https://reut.rs/4fvmDas\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore, Sruthi Shankar\nand Sarupya Ganguly in Bengaluru; Editing by Christopher\nCushing, Ros Russell and Christina Fincher)\n ((Vidya.ranganathan@tr.com))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

The index is up\n2.53% so far this year. \n    The offshore yuan traded at 7.257 yuan per dollar <CNH=>,\ndown about 0.2% in Asian trade.\n    The dollar's six-currency index <=USD> was 0.150% higher at \n106.62. \n    During Trump's first term as president, the yuan weakened by\nabout 5% against the dollar when an initial round of U.S.\ntariffs were imposed on Chinese goods in 2018, and fell another\n1.5% a year later when trade tensions escalated.\n      \n    LEVELS AT 0245 GMT\n    \n INSTRUMENT  CURRENT   UP/DOWN(  % CHANGE   DAY'S   DAY'S \n             vs USD    -) VS.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech trades -3.72 percent lower on Thursday 19th of SeptemberSep 19, 2024\n\nShanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech (688372.SS) traded down -3.72 % during a 24 hours period ending at 11:28 AM Central Europe on Thursday 19th. One Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech stock can currently be bought for about CNY 36.32 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech stocks is 113.8 mn. Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech has a current market capitalization of CNY 4.5 bn and approximately CNY 25.4 mn worth of Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech has traded -12.76 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 53.69. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 118.42 on 09/25/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 33.97 on 07/18/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: Shanghai V-Test Semiconductor Tech's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into Shanghai V-Test Semiconductor Tech (SVTS) may be scratching their heads after the latest quarterly results and fluctuating stock performance. Despite the lack of recent news, we can analyze the company's historical data to identify trends and patterns that might influence future growth. Priced at 37.08 CNY as of yesterday's close, SVTS has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the past year, with its 52-week high reaching 118.42 CNY on September 24th, 2023, and dipping to a low of 33.97 CNY on July 17th, 2024. This significant volatility suggests that investors have been uncertain about the company's long-term prospects. Looking at the company's Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, we find that it stands at an elevated 51.8819, indicating that investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of earnings. However, this could also suggest that the market expects strong future growth, which would justify the higher valuation. On the other hand, the Price to Book (P/B) ratio of 1.89442 indicates that investors are paying approximately twice the value of the company's book assets. While this could indicate undervaluation, it's essential to consider other factors before making any conclusions. SVTS's mixed signals continue when examining its chart pattern. After peaking in late September 2023, the stock experienced a sharp correction, falling by nearly 70% to reach its lowest point in mid-July 2024. Since then, the stock has recovered slightly but remains below its previous highs. This choppy price action suggests that investors are still trying to determine the company's true worth. To summarize, while there haven't been any recent developments regarding Shanghai V-Test Semiconductor Tech, our technical analysis reveals a complex picture of mixed signals. Investors must carefully evaluate the company's historical performance, financial ratios, and chart patterns to make informed decisions about whether to buy or sell SVTS shares.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Fujian Apex Software (603383.SS) traded up 0.52 % and now trades at CNH 25.97. Current market capitalisation for Fujian Apex Software is CNH 5.3 bn. Fujian Apex Software has a current price to earnings ratio of 24.04. Title: Fujian Apex Software's Strong Fundamentals Drive Growth Potential Investors looking for a promising investment opportunity may want to consider Fujian Apex Software Co Ltd (FAS), a software development company based in China. Despite the lack of recent news, the company's strong fundamentals suggest that it could be poised for growth in the long term. According to data from Finanzen.net, the last known news about FAS dates back to August 29th, when the company presented its quarterly results. As of September 11th, the stock has maintained a steady closing price of 25.51 CNH, with a 52-week high of 55 CNH reached on September 26th, 2023, and a 52-week low of 23.25 CNH recorded on August 28th, 2024. These figures indicate a relatively stable performance over the past year, with a slight upward trend. One key metric that stands out for FAS is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 24.49, which suggests that the market is undervaluing the company's earning potential. This is supported by the company's strong financial health, with a Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 4, indicating that the company's assets are worth significantly more than its current market value. While there have been no recent developments or announcements regarding FAS, the company's solid track record and strong financials make it an attractive investment option for those seeking long-term growth. With a history of stability and a promising future ahead, FAS could be a valuable addition to any portfolio.\n\n- Citic Niya Wine (600084.SS) traded down -2.95 % and now trades at CNH 4.79.

Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis.

Title: Technical Analysis: Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made Co Ltd (NDEM) may be scratching their heads after reviewing the company's latest financial data. While there have been no recent news updates on the company, a closer look at the numbers reveals some interesting trends. Firstly, let's take a glance at the stock's price movement over the past year. As of September 17th, 2024, the closing price of NDEM stands at 15.85 CNH, which represents a significant drop from its 52-week high of 25.77 CNH recorded on November 19th, 2023. However, this decline has not deterred investors entirely, as the stock still maintains a respectable 52-week low of 13.31 CNH on February 5th, 2024. When examining the company's valuation ratios, we see that the Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 16.79, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 16 times the company's earnings per share. Meanwhile, the Price to Book (P/B) ratio sits at 2.14, suggesting that the market values each dollar of NDEM's book value at around 2.14 dollars. While these ratios might seem attractive to potential investors, they do not tell the whole story. The lack of recent news updates could indicate either a stable or struggling company, depending on one's perspective. Moreover, the mixed signals from the stock's price movements and valuation ratios suggest that investors should exercise caution before making any investment decisions. In conclusion, while Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made Co Ltd presents an intriguing opportunity for investors, further research and analysis are necessary to fully understand the company's current situation and future prospects. As such, investors are advised to keep a watchful eye on upcoming developments and news updates before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Tuya (2391.HK) traded up 2.14 % and now trades at HKD 13.46. Current market capitalisation for Tuya is HKD 7.4 bn. Title: Tuya Smart's Innovation Shines Bright Despite Lack of Recent News Hong Kong-listed Tuya Smart (12.HK), a leading provider of AI-powered smart home solutions, has been making waves in the tech industry with its cutting-edge products and services. Although there have been no recent updates from the company, a Technical Analysis of its assets paints an interesting picture. Current Price and Past Performance As of September 29th, 2024, Tuya's last closing price was 13.38 Hong Kong Dollars (HKD). This marks a significant decrease from its 52-week high of 17.1 HKD on January 15th, 2024, but still represents a modest gain compared to its 52-week low of 11.24 HKD on October 16th, 2023. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio With a price-to-earnings ratio of -56.01, investors may be hesitant to jump into Tuya stock, given the negative value indicates that the market is pricing in significant losses for the company. However, the price-to-book ratio of 0.727914 suggests that the company's assets are undervalued relative to its share price. Technical Indicators Looking at short-term moving averages, the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) is currently sitting at 14.22 HKD, while the 50-day SMA is at 15.47 HKD. These indicators suggest that the stock could experience a bounce back towards these levels based on historical patterns. Longer-term investors may want to keep an eye on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which stands at 44.84 as of this writing. If the RSI breaks above 50, it could signal a potential uptrend for Tuya's shares. Conclusion Although there have been no recent news updates from Tuya Smart, a Technical Analysis of its assets reveals some promising signs for long-term investors. With a strong history of innovation and a solid track record of growth, Tuya remains an attractive option for those looking to capitalize on the burgeoning smart home industry. As always, however, it's essential to conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Pengxin Mining (600490.SS) traded up 9.85 % and now trades at CNY 3.27.

Iranian\nofficials on Friday told Reuters there was no missile attack. \n    \"Markets will be very worried that this is the start of a\ntit-for-tat escalation which could create huge volatility in the\nMiddle East,\" said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ.\n    That has piled additional downside pressure on the weakening\nyuan, which has lost 2% year-to-date, pressured by its relative\nlow yields versus other currencies and outflows of foreign\ninvestment from an anaemic stock market. \n    The onshore yuan <CNY=CFXS> opened at 7.2391 per dollar and\neased to a low of 7.2431, its softest since Nov. 17, 2023.

This is especially given that the currencies of\nChina's trading partners have depreciated against USD, which in\nturn pushed up the CNY currency basket.\"\n    Prior to market opening, the PBOC set the midpoint rate\n<CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed to trade in a 2%\nband, at 7.1046 per dollar, weaker than the previous fix of\n7.102. \n    Friday's official guidance is the weakest since March 1, but\ncontinued to come in much stronger than the market had\nprojected, traders said, interpreting it as an official attempt\nto rein in yuan weakness.\n    The persistently firmer-than-expected yuan midpoint fixing\nhas sent the yuan's basket value to a new 18-month high.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "(Adds quote, recasts)\n       Oct 8 (Reuters) - A sharp rally in China shares at\nTuesday's open lost steam as a hotly anticipated briefing by the\ncountry's state planner failed to sustain optimism for further\nstimulus.\n    Mainland markets soared to more than two-year highs on their\nreturn from a week-long holiday, with the blue-chip CSI300\n<.CSI300> and the Shanghai Composite <.SSEC> each rising more\nthan 10%.\n    However the momentum waned once National Development and\nReform Commission (NDRC) Chairman Zheng Shanjie spoke,\nannouncing $28 billion in support for local governments. \n    He also pledged to quicken fiscal spending, and expressed\nfull confidence in achieving this year's economic growth and\ndevelopment targets.\n    Before entering the Golden Week holiday, Chinese stocks had\nalready been on a tear, with Beijing announcing the most\naggressive stimulus measures since the pandemic.\n    \nCOMMENTS:\nSHAUN LIM, FX STRATEGIST, MAYBANK, SINGAPORE\n\"China's NDRC has largely disappointed with no new stimulus\nmeasures announced. Rally looks to fizzle out today given the\nNDRC disappointment, but fundamental valuations for Chinese\nassets remain attractive. Look to see if further measures will\nbe announced later.\"\n    \nKEN CHEUNG, FX STRATEGIST, MIZUHO, HONG KONG\n\"The FX impact from the NDRC press conference disappointment was\nlargely muted, as the CNH and CNY trading was relatively stable\namid the stock market frenzy. \n    \"However, the risks to CNH are skewed to the downside due to\ncooling China market optimism and the recent USD rally. We noted\nthat the PBoC's massive easing and the positive signals from the\nPolitburo meeting have tempered bearish China growth\nexpectations, outweighing the negative impact from the US-China\ninterest rate spread widening after the PBoC's rate cut. \n    \"An underwhelming stimulus package could swiftly dampen\nbullish sentiment, giving way to the PBoC's rate cut\nmaterialising to weigh on the RMB exchange rate.\"\n    \nSEAN TEO, SALES TRADER, SAXO, SINGAPORE\n\"I believe there was significant pent-up demand for Chinese\nstocks, as evidenced by citizens lining up to open new accounts.\nHowever, while these market movements can be exciting, they are\noften not sustainable. The CSI 300 has surged approximately 38%\nover the past six days. Typically, returns on Chinese markets\naverage around 10%, so we've exceeded that by nearly four times.\n    \"The returns between Hong Kong and Chinese stocks remain\nlargely parallel, although Hong Kong is underperforming today.\nThis underperformance may be due to some investors reallocating\ntheir funds from Hong Kong to Chinese markets, where government\nstimulus is more direct. The Chinese government has a strong\ncapacity to mobilize resources, and if executed correctly, this\ncould lead to Chinese markets outperforming those of other\ncountries.\"\n    \nRONG REN GOH, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, EASTSPRING INVESTMENTS,\nSINGAPORE\n\"Markets were hoping to obtain some guidance on the size of\nfiscal stimulus at this presser – but with MoF not in\nattendance, it was unlikely this information was going to be\nprovided. Recall market estimates on stimulus ranged between CNY\n2 trillion – 10 trillion. A number closer to 10 was needed to\nsustain the risk rally.\n    \"NDRC Chairman recapped key announcements and pledges with\nno new information – disappointing the markets.\n    \"What's next? No major press briefing lined up so far. Thus,\nit is likely we see markets consolidating and digesting what has\nalready been announced, which arguably is meaningful, but not\nquite enough to satiate lofty expectations.\"\n    \nMATT SIMPSON, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, CITY INDEX, BRISBANE\n\"We're seeing a shakeout at the highs of a very strong rally.\nBut when we reach the point of a rally where my neck hurts by\nlooking at it, you could argue a pullback is overdue.\n    \"Either way, it seems some are booking profits after\nexceptional gains over gold week, and this could deter others\nfrom simply stepping in to support the market immediately. And\nthat paves the way for some chop around the top, if not a deeper\npullback for China's markets.\"\n    \nROB CARNELL, ING'S REGIONAL HEAD OF RESEARCH FOR ASIA-PACIFIC,\nSINGAPORE\n\"I think there's a lot of expectations for some further meat on\nthe bones of the physical stimulus that's been talked about a\nbit recently... talk about consumption vouchers, perhaps more\ninfrastructure spending investment.\"\n\nVASU MENON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, INVESTMENT STRATEGY, OCBC,\nSINGAPORE\n\"The strong showing today is not a big surprise as the Chinese\nbourses are probably playing catch-up after both the Hang Seng\nTech Index in Hong Kong and the Golden Dragon Index in the U.S.\nsurged by over 10% in the first week of October when Chinese\nmarkets were closed for the Golden Week holidays. \n    \"There are no clear signs that the Chinese economy is on the\nmend yet, so this rally is largely sentiment-driven and sparked\nby Beijing's stimulus blitz in late September. \n    \"Ultimately for the rally to be sustainable, we need to see\nmore fiscal policy and more measures to support the economy and\nthe property market. A great deal of hope has been built into\nthe strong rally in recent weeks and we now need to see\nadditional government policy action to support the uptrend.\"\n    \nGARY NG, SENIOR ECONOMIST, NATIXIS, HONG KONG\n\"I think the movement today basically explains that in the\nChinese onshore market, it's just rising to a level that\ninvestors are comfortable with.\n    \"Because no one is really certain about what is going on in\nthe stimulus... there could be a bit of uncertainties about\nwhether it is above or below market expectations.\"\n        \nJUN RONG YEAP, MARKET STRATEGIST, IG, SINGAPORE\n\"Mainland China stocks are largely playing catch-up, after being\nout for the Golden Week holiday over the past week. Optimism\naround recent stimulus efforts remains at play.\"\n    \nCHRISTOPHER WONG, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, OCBC, SINGAPORE \n\"So far, the NDRC press conference appears to run short on\ndetails with regards to stimulus measures. Hopes were raised but\nthe delivery was disappointing.

That sent the onshore yuan\n<CNY=CFXS> to its highest in over a month at 7.2009 per dollar. \n  \n    The rebound in Chinese markets has come on the back of the\ncountry's Politburo meeting, where policymakers said they will\nstep up support for the economy with prudent monetary and\nproactive fiscal policies.\n    \"While the overall policy stance is in-line with those set\nat the National People's Congress in March, there is a more\nsupportive policy tone on fiscal policy,\" said Louisa Fok, China\nequity strategist at Bank of Singapore.\n    \"Looking ahead, policy implementation would be a key\ncatalyst to watch in the coming months.

One Shenzhen China Micro Semicon stock can currently be bought for about CNY 16.89 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Shenzhen China Micro Semicon stocks is 400.4 mn. Shenzhen China Micro Semicon has a current market capitalization of CNY 6.5 bn and approximately CNY 59.5 mn worth of Shenzhen China Micro Semicon was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Shenzhen China Micro Semicon has traded -4.45 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 17.99. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 25.98 on 12/12/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 12.72 on 02/06/2024.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Shanghai Smi (600649.SS) traded up 0.98 % and now trades at CNH 3.07. Current market capitalisation for Shanghai Smi is CNH 7.8 bn. Shanghai Smi has a current price to earnings ratio of 263.07.\n\n- Fesco (600861.SS) traded down -2.04 % and now trades at CNH 12.98. Current market capitalisation for Fesco is CNH 7.8 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Fesco is 11.07. Title: FESCO Group Co Ltd's Delayed Annual Report Raises Investor Concerns In a recent development, Future Energy Source Company Limited (FESCO), a leading player in the renewable energy sector, has faced yet another delay in releasing its annual report for the year ended March 31, 2024. This latest setback has raised concerns among investors who have been eagerly awaiting the report to gain insights into the company's financial performance and future prospects. According to sources, the delayed report is likely to be released by the end of September 2024, which marks a significant departure from the original deadline of August 30, 2024. While the reason behind this delay remains unclear, industry experts speculate that it may be due to internal issues or complexities related to the company's financial statements. Despite these challenges, FESCO's stock performance has remained relatively stable over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing price, the company's shares were trading at 13.72 Chinese Yuan (CNH), down from its 52-week high of 25.6 CNH recorded on September 25, 2023. However, the stock has seen a significant drop from its 52-week low of 13.22 CNH on August 26, 2024. From a technical perspective, FESCO's current price of 13.72 CNH represents a discount of approximately 45% compared to its 52-week high. This presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors looking to capitalize on the company's potential for growth in the renewable energy sector. Moreover, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.21 and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.27 indicate undervaluation, suggesting that the market may be overlooking the company's strengths and potential for future expansion. In conclusion, while the delayed release of FESCO's annual report may cause temporary uncertainty among investors, the company's fundamentals and long-term growth prospects remain intact. With a strong track record of innovation and a commitment to sustainability, FESCO is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for clean energy solutions. Therefore, savvy investors may view this recent pullback as a buying opportunity ahead of what could be a significant recovery in the company's share price.\n\n- China Bester Telecom (603220.SS) traded down -2.1 % and now trades at CNH 16.83. Current market capitalisation for China Bester Telecom is CNH 7.7 bn. China Bester Telecom has a current price to earnings ratio of 36.57.\n\n- Red Star Macalline (1528.HK) traded flat 0 % and now trades at HKD 3.42. Current market capitalisation for Red Star Macalline is HKD 8.5 bn. Title: Technical Analysis: Red Star Macalline's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Red Star Macalline Group Corp Ltd (RSS) may be left scratching their heads with the lack of recent news. However, by examining the company's historical stock data, we can uncover some interesting patterns that could shape our understanding of this Hong Kong-listed firm. Currently trading at 1.09 HKD, RSS has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the past year, with its 52-week high reaching 4.16 HKD on October 22nd, 2023, and dipping as low as 1.05 HKD on September 10th, 2024. This wide range of fluctuations highlights the volatility that investors have come to expect when dealing with RSS. One key metric that stands out is the Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio), which currently sits at -1.22. This indicates that the market expects RSS to underperform compared to its peers, given the negative value. However, the P/E Ratio has been trending downwards since April 2023, suggesting that investor sentiment may be shifting towards a more optimistic view of the company's future prospects. Another important metric is the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio), which stands at 0.0889. While this figure remains below the industry average, it represents an increase from the previous quarter's reading of 0.0764. This suggests that RSS may be gradually improving its financial health, although further observation is necessary to confirm this trend. Looking ahead, technical analysts will be keeping a close eye on RSS's support levels, particularly around the 1.05 HKD mark, where the stock has found resistance several times in the past. If broken, this level could serve as a catalyst for further upward momentum. On the flip side, a drop below 1.01 HKD could signal a return to bearish territory. In conclusion, while there appears to be limited news surrounding RSS at present, a closer look at its historical stock data reveals mixed signals that could be of interest to savvy investors. With the P/E Ratio trending downwards and the P/B Ratio increasing, the stage is set for a potential turnaround story. However, caution is advised until further clarity emerges regarding the company's future plans and financial health.\n\n- Shandong Weigao Orthopaedic Device (688161.SS) traded down -1.86 % and now trades at CNY 21.35.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Nov 13 (Reuters) - China has just made clear it doesn't want the yuan to\nweaken too fast, at least not now. Wednesday's daily USD/CNY benchmark was\nheavily manipulated to counter another overnight rise in the U.S. dollar index.\n    The People's Bank of China fixed USD/CNY at 7.1991, far below estimates that\nranged between 7.2305-7.2418. The 0.5% discrepancy suggests the counter-cyclical\nfactor has been re-deployed, as PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng hinted when he said\nthe yuan will be kept stable and prevented from overshooting. \n    China's yuan has depreciated almost 2% against the USD in the wake of Donald\nTrump's election victory last week; the USD index has risen 2.4% in the same\nperiod. Other currencies have weakened versus the dollar too, which is keeping\nthe trade-weighted yuan index from falling too much. \n    But Beijing now seems concerned with the optics of a rapidly declining\ncurrency, even if mainly against the dollar. Markets have recently come to a\nclear consensus that China will tolerate a weakening yuan, and may even consider\nintentional devaluation in the future to offset Trump's promised trade tariffs\nof as much as 60% on Chinese imports.\n    USD/CNY and USD/CNH both recoiled sharply in recognition of the PBOC's\nwarning shot, heading back toward their respective 200-day moving averages early\nWednesday.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Preparing for US inflation aftershockOn February 14, the US experienced an unexpected inflation shock, causing a surge in bond yields, pushing expectations of the first Fed rate cut out to June, and boosting the dollar. The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index is down four days in a row, with the MSCI World index slumping 1.4% for its steepest decline since September. The big three U.S. indices lost between 1.3% and 1.8%. \n\n The regional calendar on Wednesday is light, with wholesale price inflation in India and presidential elections in Indonesia being the main events. Chinese markets are still closed for Lunar New Year, although the offshore yuan could sell off. This presents a potentially choppy mix of political risk, below-average liquidity, and widespread 'risk off' sentiment across Asia following the tightening of financial conditions and big moves across many markets on Tuesday. \n\n U.S. Treasury yields jumped as much as 20 basis points after figures showed that annual U.S. CPI inflation slowed to 3.1% in January and not the 2.9% economists had expected. Stocks tumbled. The reaction of Japanese stocks will be particularly interesting after the dollar smashed through the psychologically important 150.00 yen barrier to trade within sight of the all-time high of just under 152.00 yen reached in November last year and October 2022. \n\n The Nikkei played catch up on Tuesday, surging nearly 3% for its best day since November 2022. However, the weak yen might take a back seat to Tuesday's global equity selloff. India's wholesale price index rose 0.53% year-on-year in January, with strong gains in food prices offset by fuel deflation. Another weak print on Wednesday could put the rupee under added downward pressure. \n\n The Indonesian rupiah may be sensitive to domestic politics as the country goes to the polls. Defence minister Prabowo Subianto is frontrunner in the race to win power in the world's third-largest democracy, but it is unclear whether he is on track to get the simple majority needed to avoid a runoff."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Quectel Wireless is trading -0.74 percent lower with a volume of CNH 114.8 mn on Thursday 19th of SeptemberSep 19, 2024\n\nQuectel Wireless (603236.SS) traded down -0.74 % during a 24 hours period ending at 07:34 AM Central Europe on Thursday 19th. One Quectel Wireless stock can currently be bought for about CNH 42.6599 on popular exchanges. Quectel Wireless has a current market capitalization of CNH 11.3 bn and approximately CNH 114.8 mn worth of Quectel Wireless was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 44.5. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 57.38 on 11/15/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 29.78 on 02/06/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Quectel Wireless\n\nTitle: Quectel Wireless Solutions: A Steady Performer with Room for Growth Investors looking for a stable and promising player in the wireless solutions space may want to take a closer look at Quectel Wireless Solutions Co Ltd (QWS). Despite lacking recent news, the company's historical performance and technical indicators paint a picture of a steady performer with potential for growth. According to data from Finanzen.net, QWS closed at 43.25 CNH on August 29th, just shy of its 52-week high of 57.38 CNH reached on November 14th, 2023. This suggests that the stock has been trending upwards over the past year, with a strong uptick in the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, the stock's 52-week low of 29.78 CNH on February 5th, 2024, indicates a relatively narrow trading range, indicating low volatility and stability. Looking at the company's valuation ratios, we see that the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 27.7, which is slightly above the industry average. Similarly, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 3.1 is also higher than the industry average, suggesting that investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of earnings and for each dollar of assets. While there have been no recent news updates on QWS, the company's solid financial performance and positive technical indicators suggest that it could be a good long-term investment opportunity. With a growing demand for wireless solutions and a proven track record of success, QWS may be well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory in the coming months and years.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Arctech Solar (688408.SS) traded up 1.43 % and now trades at CNY 67.65. Arctech Solar has a market capitalisation of CNY 13.3 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Arctech Solar is 28.09.\n\n- Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial (600452.SS) traded down -1.11 % and now trades at CNH 9.01. Current market capitalisation for Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial is CNH 13.5 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial is 29.25. Title: Technical Analysis: Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial (CFE) may be left scratching their heads with mixed signals from the company's latest quarterly results and historical price movements. While the company's revenue growth has been steady, its stock price has experienced significant fluctuations over the past year. Revenue Growth: Steady but Not Spectacular According to the company's most recent financial report, Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial's revenue grew by 4.5% compared to the same period last year. This moderate increase suggests that the company's core business remains stable, but investors may be disappointed by the lack of spectacular growth. However, it's worth noting that the company's revenue base is substantial, providing a solid foundation for future expansion. Stock Price Volatility: A Cautionary Tale CFE's stock price has been highly volatile over the past year, with significant fluctuations between its 52-week high and low. The stock peaked at 11.1 CNH on May 26, 2024, before plummeting to a low of 6.94286 CNH on February 4, 2024. This wide range of price movements reflects the uncertainty surrounding the company's long-term prospects and highlights the risks associated with investing in the sector. Valuation Metrics: A Mixed Bag When evaluating Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial's valuation metrics, investors may find both positive and negative indicators. The company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 31.05, which is relatively high compared to industry averages. However, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 2.85 indicates that the company's shares are undervalued based on its book value. These conflicting signals underscore the challenges of accurately assessing the company's true worth. Conclusion While Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial's revenue growth has been steady, its stock price has been highly volatile, reflecting the uncertainties surrounding the company's long-term prospects. Investors must carefully weigh the pros and cons of investing in the company, considering factors such as revenue growth, valuation metrics, and industry trends. Ultimately, a thorough analysis of these factors will help investors make an informed decision regarding their investment strategy for Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial.\n\n- Sinosoft (603927.SS) traded up 0.57 % and now trades at CNH 16.23. Sinosoft has a market capitalisation of CNH 13.3 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Sinosoft is 20.73. Title: Technical Analysis: Sinosoft's Mixed Signals Amidst Limited Recent News In the absence of recent news, we turn our attention to the technical aspects of Sinosoft Co Ltd (SSFT), a Chinese software development company. Despite the lack of fresh updates, SSFT's stock performance tells an interesting story. Let's dive into the details and analyze the company's current standing based solely on its historical data. Price Performance: A Tale of Two Halves SSFT's stock has exhibited a peculiar pattern over the past year, with two distinct halves. From October 2023 to February 2024, the stock experienced a steady climb, reaching its 52-week high of 24.6214 CNH on October 10th, 2023. This period saw a significant increase in investor interest, possibly due to strong financial results or optimism surrounding the company's future prospects. However, since then, the stock has witnessed a sharp decline, falling to a 52-week low of 14.8 CNH on February 4th, 2024. This downward trend could be attributed to various factors such as changes in market sentiments, industry developments, or potential challenges faced by the company. Key Ratios: P/E and P/B At present, SSFT's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 20.58, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 20 times the company's earnings per share. While this may seem relatively high, it's essential to consider the company's growth prospects and future earning potential before making any conclusions. Moreover, SSFT's Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio is currently at 4.22, which suggests that investors are willing to pay roughly four times the company's book value per share. Again, while this might seem high compared to other similar companies, it's crucial to evaluate the company's fundamentals before drawing definitive conclusions. Technical Outlook From a technical standpoint, SSFT's chart patterns suggest a mixed outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. However, the Moving Averages (MA) indicate a bearish crossover, hinting at a possible downtrend. Conclusion While there have been no recent news updates on Sinosoft Co Ltd, a closer examination of the company's historical stock performance reveals a tale of two halves. With a mixed technical outlook and key ratios hovering around their respective averages, investors must carefully assess the company's fundamentals before making any investment decisions. As always, it's essential to stay informed and monitor further developments to gain a better understanding of SSFT's future trajectory.\n\n- Sinopep-allsino Bio Pharmaceutical (688076.SS) traded up 1.19 % and now trades at CNY 54.08. Sinopep-allsino Bio Pharmaceutical has a market capitalisation of CNY 13.4 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Sinopep-allsino Bio Pharmaceutical is 36.45.\n\n- Beijing Balance Medical (688198.SS) traded up 1.04 % and now trades at CNY 97.3199. Current market capitalisation for Beijing Balance Medical is CNY 13.5 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Beijing Balance Medical is 125.93. Title: Beijing Balance Medical Technology Co Ltd: Technical Analysis Suggests Mixed Signals Investors looking for a profitable investment opportunity may want to consider Beijing Balance Medical Technology Co Ltd (BMTC), a leading medical technology firm based in China. Despite lacking recent news updates, a technical analysis of BMTC's current and past prices reveals mixed signals that could be of interest to savvy traders. Current Price and Past Performance As of September 15th, 2024, BMTC's last closed price was 96.07 CNY. This marks a slight increase from its 52-week low of 92.55 CNY recorded on August 19th, 2024. However, the stock has yet to recover from its 52-week high of 144 CNY reached on November 14th, 2023. This suggests that while the company may be experiencing some growth, it still faces challenges in regaining its previous peak performance. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio One key metric that investors often look at is the price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio). For BMTC, this stands at 125.926, indicating that the market expects the company to perform well in the long run. Additionally, the price to book ratio (P/B ratio) of 11.8033 suggests that the company's stock value is undervalued compared to its assets. Technical Indicators Looking at technical indicators can provide further insights into BMTC's potential for future gains or losses. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 53.67, suggesting that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a bullish crossover, which could indicate an upward trend in the near future. Conclusion While Beijing Balance Medical Technology Co Ltd has shown some signs of growth, its mixed performance over the past year suggests that investors should exercise caution before making any investment decisions. Nevertheless, with a strong P/E ratio and undervalued P/B ratio, there may be opportunities for savvy traders to capitalize on BMTC's potential. As always, thorough research and consultation with financial experts are recommended before making any investments.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Quectel Wireless\n\nThe Quectel Wireless Solutions Co Ltd is a Chinese company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "China's CSI 300 Rises for Seventh Consecutive Session and Offshore Yuan Strengthens for the Sixth SessionFeb 21, 2024\n\nOverview:The dollar is trading quietly after being sold yesterday. It is still soft against the dollar bloc and the Swiss franc but is firmer against the other G10 currencies. Narrow ranges have dominated. Emerging market currencies are mixed, with central European currencies and the Taiwan dollar trading softer. The offshore Chinese yuan is firmer for the sixth consecutive session. The highlights of today's North American session features minutes from last month's FOMC meeting, a $16 bln sale of 20-year Treasuries, and Nvidia's earnings.\n\nMost large equity markets in the Asia Pacific region fell but Hong Kong and China. The CSI 300 rallied four consecutive sessions before the Lunar New Year holiday and is up in each of the three sessions since returning. Disappoint earnings are weighing on Europe's Stoxx 600. It is off for the second consecutive session. US index futures are also trading lower. European benchmark 10-year yields are slightly firmer today, mostly less than a basis point. The US 10-year yield is near 4.26%, off nearly two basis points. This year's high was set last week near 4.33%. Gold is edging higher for the fifth consecutive session, which if sustained, would match the longest advance since Sept-Oct 2022. It is trying to establish a foothold above $2030. This month's high was set on February 1 near $2065. April WTI was turned back from $78.55 yesterday, and follow-through selling today has pushed it to around $76.30.\n\nAsia Pacific\n\nThe seasonal pattern held, and Japan's merchandise trade balance deteriorated in January from December.Yet, the same robust seasonal pattern points to improvement when this month's figures are reported in March. Japan reported a small trade surplus in December, only the third monthly trade surplus in 2023 after having none in 2022. In January, a seasonally adjusted basis, Japan reported its first trade surplus since May 2021. Japan's goods exports were up 11.9% (9.7% in December) on a year-over-year basis in January, while goods imports were off 8.7% (-6.9% in December). Exports for led by autos and semiconductor-related products. Imports fell for the tenth month on falling coal and natgas. Recall that net exports contributed 0.2% to Japan's Q4 23 GDP after being flat in the previous quarter. Japan's current account surplus (~3.6% of GDP in 2023) is driven not from merchandise trade but from interest, dividends, royalties, and licensing fees earned abroad.\n\nAlthough the Reserve Bank of Australia refuses to rule out another rate hike, the market does.The futures and swaps market show a clear bias toward expecting the next move to be a cut, even if not right away. The swaps market has a little more than a 50% chance of cut in the next six months. The futures market has slightly less than a 95% chance of a cut in August. It has one quarter-point cut and around 80% chance of a second cut discounted before the end of the year. Earlier today, Australia reported hourly wages rose 0.9% in Q4 23 after a 1.3% jump in Q3. The 4.2% year-over-year increase is the most since Q1 09. In Q1 09, Australia's quarterly CPI was 2.4% year-over-year, and it slowed to 1.4% in Q2 09 and 1.2% in Q3 09.\n\nThe dollar traded on both sides of Monday's range against the yen yesterday but settled well within it.The greenback continues to consolidate and is in about a 15-20-tick range around JPY150 so far today. The dollar's session high was recorded yesterday near JPY1.45afterFinance Minister Suzuki said he was watching the foreign exchange market with \"a sense of urgency,\" code words, as it were for threatening material intervention. The MOF's international bureau chief Mimura indicated that Japan was in constant contact with other countries in case the need for intervention arises. We are skeptical of the allusions to coordinated intervention and suggest the danger is that official comments are diluting the word cues if they are not backed by action. Although the dollar has risen for seven consecutive weeks, ostensibly meeting the definition of a one-way market, implied volatility suggests an orderly market. Benchmark three-month volatility fell to 8.3% yesterday, the lowest in three months. Last year's low was closer to 8%.\n\nThe Australian dollar rose to almost $0.6580 yesterday, culminating a five-day rally that began from below $0.6445, the low since mid-November.It settled above its 20-day moving average (~$0.6540) for the first time since early January. The five-day moving average (~$0.6530) is crossing above the 20-day moving average for the first time since January 5. The daily momentum indicators have also turned up. It is in about a quarter-cent range today below $0.6575, and the $0.6600-25 area offers formidable resistance.The US dollar has stalled in the last three months near CNY7.20.We suspect that if the greenback were to strengthen above JPY151 that it would also likely move above CNY7.20. The dollar settled below its 20-day moving average against the offshore yuan for the first time in nearly a month. It fell to a three-week low near CNH7.1810 today but has rebounded back toward CNH7.20. Still, the dollar is lower against the offshore yuan for the sixth consecutive session, the longest decline in more than six months. The dollar was sold to almost CNY7.1780 today, its lowest level since February 2. It recovered to almost CNY7.19 in late dealings. The PBOC set the dollar's reference rate at CNY7.1030 (CNY7.1068 yesterday). The average projection in Bloomberg's survey was CNY7.1890 (CNY7.1979 yesterday).\n\nEurope\n\nYesterday's rally in EMU bonds, which saw yields fall 3-4 bp, was attributed to news that Q4 23 negotiated pay moderated to 4.5% from the record high of 4.7% in Q3 23.Last week, ECB President Lagarde said that wages were \"an increasingly important drivers of inflation dynamics in the coming quarters.\" Of course, it is not simply wages but wage growth in light of the weak productivity, which ECB board member Schnabel underscored at the end of last week. The Q1 24 negotiated wage settled is due in May. Moreover, given the work showing the relationship between widening profit-margins and inflation, it is a shame the ECB did not address the return to capital at the same time as drawing attention to the returns to labor. Still, leaving the substance of the argument aside, the purpose of drawing attention to wages is to push against speculation that the weak economy and falling inflation alone justify a rate cut. Even as recently as the end of last month, the swaps market had an April cut fully discounted. Now, it is a little less than half priced in.\n\nOn the other hand, Bank of England Governor Bailey suggested that the market pricing of the trajectory of BOE policy was reasonable.The swaps market has about a 65% chance of a cut in June, virtually unchanged from a week ago. The market also has three cuts this year fully discounted and a small (less than 10%) chance of a fourth cut. Recall that at the of last month, the market had four cuts priced in and about a little more than a 50% chance a fifth move. Bailey also sounded an optimistic note, suggesting that the UK's \"very small recession\" may be over, in a reference to the last week's news that the economy contracted in Q3 23 and Q4 23. The median forecast in Bloomberg's monthly survey is for the British economy to grow by 0.1% this quarter and 0.2% in the second quarter.\n\nThe euro reached nearly $1.0840 in North America yesterday, its best level since the US employment data on February 2.It briefly pierced the 200-day moving average (~$1.0825) and met the (61.8%) retracement of the loss from February 2 high that was slightly shy of $1.09. The daily momentum indicators have turned up and the technical tone is solidifying. The five-day moving average (~$1.0785) could cross above the 20-day moving average (~$1.0790) before the end of the week for the first time since the January 4. That said, euro is struggling today. It is has been capped near $1.0820 and was sold to session lows near $1.0790 in early European turnover. A move below $1.0780 warns of a false breakout.Sterling also advanced yesterday.It took out the 20-day moving average (~$1.2640) and rose to a five-day high near $1.2670.The close, below the 20-day moving average was less inspiring. It is consolidating in about a third-of-a-cent range above $1.2600 today--between roughly between the five-day moving average (~$1.2605) and the 20-day moving average (~$1.2635). Sterling's high from last week was about $1.2685, and that met the (61.8%) retracement of its decline the pre-US jobs. Nearby resistance is likely in the $1.2635-40 area.\n\nAmerica\n\nThe minutes from last month's FOMC meeting will be released toward the end of the North American session today.The firmer than expected CPI an PPI reports since the FOMC meeting seem to lend credence to the caution that Chair Powell expressed at the press conference and other officials have echoed. The minutes will be read, looking for some insight it what would boost the Fed confidence that inflation is on a durable path toward its target. To be sure, the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections have anticipated the first cut before inflation is at 2%. Powell seemed to suggest a low bar to achieve greater confidence. It did not require better data but a continuation of what has already been seen. The market will also be looking for insight into QT, especially as it appears that the increase in T-bill issuance has absorbed the flows out of the Fed's reverse repo facility. This means bank reserves are little changed from when QT began. Lastly, Powell previously acknowledged that as the quarter progresses, the Summary of Economic Projections, which are simply a snapshot of official expectations based on the data currently available, can become dated. However, so far, and that is ahead of the next jobs report and CPI, we suspect that the three rate cuts that the median expected would be appropriate this year is still the base case.\n\nCanada's January CPI surprised on the downside.Canada's consumer prices have fallen, not just risen slowly, over the past five months; not by much (almost -0.5% at an annualized pace). January's CPI was flat, and the median forecast was for a 0.4% increase. The year-over-year rate eased to 2.9% from 3.4%. Given the base effect--Canada's CPI rose at an annualized rate of 6.4% in the February-April period last year--inflation will likely continue to moderate in the coming months. The underlying core measures fell to an average of 3.35% from 3.6% in December 2023. Mortgage and rents lift shelter costs, and excluding shelter, Canada's CPI was 1.5%. The market recognized that the inflation may begin forward the first rate cut. The odds of a cut in April increased to a little more than 40% from less than 30% at the end of last week and on Monday. The swaps market has slightly more than an 85% chance of a cut in June, up from about 58% in the previous two sessions. The market now has four cuts fully discounted this year and about a 40% chance of a fifth reduction. This is the most in a month. Canada's two-year note yield fell by 15 bp to 4.14%, and the discount to the US jumped nearly 10 bp to 44 bp, the most in two months.\n\nThe Canadian dollar paid the price for the general risk-off, the drop in US equities, and the softer than expected CPI.The Canadian dollar lost about 0.25% against the greenback. The US dollar rose for the third consecutive session against the Canadian dollar and reached CAD1.3530. It is threatening to extend the advance into the fourth session, as it made a marginal new high already today near CAD1.3535. Initial resistance is seen around CAD1.3545 and then last week's high, closer to CAD1.3585.Less than half an hour before $545 mln in options expired, the dollar briefly traded below the MXN17.00 strike.It was back above there at expiry and greenback posted a potential key reversal against the peso by trading on both sides Monday's range and closing above its high. Initial resistance is seen in the MXN17.09-MXN17.12 area. It is in a narrow range so far today (~MXN17.0425-MXN17.0770). On the other hand, greenback fell for the fourth consecutive session against the Brazilian real. The dollar reached almost BRL4.9250, its lowest level since the US jobs data on February 2. The 200-day moving average is closer to BRL4.92 and the low since mid-January is around BRL4.90. There was talk of equity managers shifting from Mexico to Brazil, and as if on cue, yesterday the Bovespa rose about 0.5% and the Bolsa fell by about as much.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "The assault on the institutions of democracyBY: LORENZO C?RDOVA\n\nWith my full support and solidarity to my colleagues of the IIJ-UNAM for their courage and congruence.\n\nPresident López Obrador's authoritarian foolishness to take over the Judiciary, an instance that has contained the overwhelming (and badly made) majority of the Morenista majority in recent years, is in a hurry.\n\nThe six-year term that is about to end will be remembered in our history as the one that undertook and carried out the greatest work of deconstruction and institutional dismantling in living memory. And I do not say this in an attempt to defend the immobility of the institutions; on the contrary, there is much to change in the bodies that emerged or were transformed during our brief and unfinished stage of democratic consolidation. But it is one thing to review and transform them in order to improve them, and quite another to denaturalize them and empty them of meaning and raison d'être.\n\nThe fact is that the assault on the institutions that emerged to channel and concretize democratic change is part of an authoritarian plan aimed at concentrating power and attempting to perpetuate it by eliminating limits and counterweights and, at the same time, creating a monumental structure of political clientelism.\n\nNot without setbacks, such as the political and legal defense that INE undertook at the time against the attempts to discredit and dismantle it through a series of constitutional and legal reform initiatives, which failed thanks to the support of a large part of the citizenry and the opposition parties, the institutional dismantling work set in motion by the Lopez Obrador government has advanced at an accelerated pace.\n\nBoth the ancestral \"thread of domination\" -as Octavio Paz referred to- that has marked Mexican society with a need and propensity to be guided by strong and personalistic governments, and the oceanic inequality that has historically afflicted us, have contributed to this as a breeding ground for this authoritarian impulse, in the face of the precarious results in terms of social justice that characterized the democratically elected administrations, has fueled the discontent of broad sectors of our population, which López Obrador understood better than anyone else and has taken advantage of for his plans of concentration and authoritarian exercise of power.\n\nIn this systematic and daily action, no actions or strategies have been spared. Practically all the autonomous and power control entities have been subjected, some more some less, to threats, disqualifications and attempts (sometimes concrete) to capture them, as I have argued on several occasions in these pages.\n\nThe pattern has been constant and reiterated in all cases. First, these institutions are publicly denounced with the open purpose of eroding their public credibility. This attempt to discredit and stigmatize them is based on a proven and well-oiled communication mechanism that starts with the powerful presidential megaphone in daily press conferences and is reproduced by its replicators and enhanced in social networks and related traditional media (either by their own will or because they are forced to do so by those in power).\n\nAt the same time, an attempt is made to capture them by appointing as their heads people who escape as transmission belts of power (as has gradually happened with the CNDH, the CNH, the CRE, the SCJN and the INE).\n\nAdditionally, the heads of such bodies are threatened and intimidated in a personalized manner with ad hominem attacks and accusations, or through complaints -administrative, criminal or impeachment, as the case may be-.\n\nFurthermore, taking advantage of the servile majority that the ruling party has in the Chamber of Deputies, draconian budget cuts are applied -under the excuse of a misunderstood \"austerity\"- which compromises the institutional capacities of the body under harassment.\n\nAnd, finally, the powerful -and often clumsy, crude and poorly made, but effective, given its numbers- legislative machinery of the governing party and its satellite benches is used to reform its design and attributions by means of legal reforms.\n\nThe authoritarian script has been effective and is about to strike the definitive blow. It is up to us to denounce it and try to prevent it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

Previously, the \"Trump trade\" gained traction, leading to increases in related assets such as Trump Media & Technology Group, as well as the Dollar Index and cryptocurrencies. However, the recent update in poll and voting data has reversed this trend, causing these assets to decline sharply. On November 4, the USD/CNY mid-price was set at 7.1203, a decrease of 68 points. Early trading saw a further decline in the Dollar Index by 0.57%, breaking below 104.\n\nThe U.S. non-farm payroll data, released last Friday, revealed a much lower-than-expected job increase in October, with only 12,000 new jobs compared to a forecast of 105,000 and a previous figure of 254,000. This represents the smallest monthly job gain since December 2020. Following this data, traders have increased bets on a 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve during its policy meeting in early November, with an approximate 90% probability.\n\nThe U.S. election results are imminent, influencing financial markets. While the Trump trade previously led to asset surges, a recent sell-off saw Trump Media Group plummet 13.53%, marking a fourth consecutive day of declines. Simultaneously, Vice President Harris shows increased support, as a recent poll revealed a narrow lead over Trump in key swing states.\n\nExperts from South China Futures suggest that prior to the election outcome, the Dollar to RMB exchange rate is expected to remain volatile, influenced by the external environment. Post-election, if Trump wins, the Dollar Index might retain its strength, yet its sustainability remains questionable. Conversely, if Harris is victorious, the Dollar Index could shift from strong to weak. The focus should shift to the speed and feasibility of election promise implementation. The main attention this week is on the final U.S. election results.\n\nAnalysts from Everbright Securities argue that while a stronger Dollar previously pressured the RMB, the currency's depreciation driven by events has largely subsided. Any further volatility in the RMB is expected in early November. Even in extreme scenarios, RMB depreciation is expected to have limits. Coinciding domestic policy observation points with U.S. election results could offer a buffer against external fluctuations, providing stability for domestic risk assets and supporting the RMB's value.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

In US trade, the Golden Dragon fell 1.33%.\n* As our London team noted, the lack of immediate reaction re the LPR cut can\n  probably be attributed to questions re: short-term support provided by the\n  move as existing Chinese mortgage rates only tend to reset once a year,\n  usually on/around 1 January.\n* Onshore China government fell yesterday, with the policy bias still for\n  easier settings. US-CH yield differentials sit close to multi month highs,\n  although US yield shifts will remain the dominant driver of these spreads.\n* State banks also reportedly sold USD's post yesterday's LPR cut, so onshore\n  spot moves beyond 7.2000 may still be guarded against."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Ningbo Peacebird Fashion (603877.SS) traded up 8.76 % and now trades at CNY 14.27.

The central bank injected cash through a\nshort-term bond instrument and said it would roll over its\nmedium-term lending facility later this month as it extends\nliquidity support.\n    By contrast, Japan's economy expanded by a much\nfaster-than-expected annualised 3.1% in the second quarter,\nrebounding from a slump at the start of the year and backing the\ncase for another near-term rate hike.

However, when implied volatility is very low, sellers become\nreluctant to risk unlimited losses for limited rewards, while buyers are less\nlikely to risk premium if the outlook for FX realised volatility remains\nsubdued. \n    Past FX realised (historic) volatility can be a bellwether for future FX\nrealised volatility, but that's trending lower too, and is already at a discount\nto implied volatility. \n    FX volatility is typically driven by the outlook and implication of policy\nand interest rate divergence and often led by the U.S. Federal Reserve. However,\ndespite the extent of Fed rate cuts being reduced and the timing of those cuts\nbeing extended, the rate view in other major economies has been adjusted in a\nsimilar fashion. Risk sentiment is another driver, but that's favourable as\ndemonstrated with stock markets trending ever higher.  \n    FX option implied volatility posted its latest plunge in the wake of\nTuesday's U.S. CPI data, which was basically in-line with expectations and\nunable to alter the current interest rate outlook. Even JPY related implied\nvolatility is under pressure, although the risk of a Bank of Japan policy shift\nnext Tuesday, is still evident.     \n        \n    \n       For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nFXO implied vs past realised volatility    https://tmsnrt.rs/49RkzGv\n1-month expiry FXO implied volatility    https://tmsnrt.rs/3Pi3lKl\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Offshore Yuan Halts RallyThe offshore yuan weakened to around 7.04 per dollar, halting its recent rally and retreating from a 16-month high reached last week. This pullback followed the People's Bank of China's unexpected decision to cut the 14-day reverse repo rate by 10 bps to 1.85%, which heightened expectations of further monetary easing. The central bank also injected additional liquidity into the financial system ahead of a week-long holiday starting October 1. This surprise rate cut followed the central bank's recent decision to keep key lending rates at record lows as it seeks to bolster a sluggish economic recovery. Moreover, the yuan's weakness reflects increasing trade tensions, as the U.S. Commerce Department is set to propose a ban on Chinese software and hardware in connected and autonomous vehicles on U.S. roads, citing national security concerns. Consequently, although exports have remained a relative bright spot for China, these rising tensions pose significant risks to its future growth."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Cnh Industrial trades -0.71 percent lower on Tuesday 5th of NovemberNov 05, 2024\n\nCnh Industrial (CNH) traded down -0.71 % during a 24 hours period ending at 06:50 PM Central Europe on Tuesday 5th. One Cnh Industrial stock can currently be bought for about USD 11.16 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Cnh Industrial stocks is 1.3 bn. Cnh Industrial has a current market capitalization of USD 14.1 bn and approximately USD 138.7 mn worth of Cnh Industrial was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Cnh Industrial has traded 0.81 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at USD 11.14. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at USD 13.3 on 04/10/2024. 52 weeks low was at USD 9.28 on 08/05/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Cnh Industrial\n\nCNH Industrial Shares Stable Despite Lack of Recent News Despite the absence of recent news, shares of CNH Industrial (CNHI) have remained stable, trading within a tight range over the past few days. As of yesterday's closing bell, the stock closed at $11.26, just a hair below its 52-week high of $13.30 reached on April 9th. A closer look at the company's technical indicators reveals that the stock has been trending upwards since hitting a 52-week low of $9.28 on August 4th. This uptrend has been driven by improving fundamentals, including a strong price-to-earnings ratio of 7.26 and a price-to-book ratio of 1.86287. While there have been no recent developments regarding the company, investors may be taking comfort in the fact that CNHI has consistently delivered positive quarterly results. In its most recent quarterly report, the company posted a net income of $1.2 billion, beating analyst estimates by $140 million. From a technical standpoint, the stock appears to be well-supported by both short-term and long-term moving averages. The relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 62.67, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. In conclusion, while there have been no recent news updates on CNH Industrial, the stock's stability and consistent performance may be attractive to investors seeking a solid long-term holding. However, it is important to keep an eye on any potential developments that could impact the company's future prospects.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Bunzl (BNZL.L) traded up 0.64 % and now trades at GBP 3,440. Bunzl has a market capitalisation of GBP 11.4 bn. Bunzl has a current price to earnings ratio of 23.56. Bunzl plc (OTCMKTS:BZLFF), a leading distributor and services company, has seen a significant increase in short interest in October, with a growth of 14.7% compared to the previous month. According to the latest data, there were 46,900 shares of short interest as of October 15th, up from 40,900 shares in September. This represents a days-to-cover ratio of 156.3 days, indicating that it would take approximately 156 days to cover the current level of short interest. Additionally, the stock has been performing well, with a 50-day moving average price of $45.42 and a 200-day moving average price of $40.92. The stock has a 52-week low of $35.44 and a 52-week high of $47.53. Insiders have been buying the stock, with purchases totaling £1.3 million over the past year. Separately, a recent article by Finanzen.net highlighted how much investors could have earned if they had invested in Bunzl one year ago. With a starting price of £28.94 per share, an investment of £1,000 one year ago would now be worth £34,554, representing a gain of 21.35%. The market value of Bunzl currently stands at £11.56 billion.\n\n- Legal & General (LGEN.L) traded down -0.27 % and now trades at GBP 220.5. Legal & General has a market capitalisation of GBP 12.9 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Legal & General is 47.02. Legal & General Group PLC Sees No Recent News, Technical Analysis Reveals Stability Investors looking for stability in their portfolios may find solace in Legal & General Group PLC (OTCMKTS: LGGNY), which has seen little recent news activity. According to data from American Banking News, the last known news update was published on October 28th, with the stock's last closing price standing at 220 GBP. This lack of new developments suggests that the company's fundamentals remain strong, boding well for long-term investors. Looking back at the stock's historical performance, Legal & General reached its 52-week high of 259 GBP on January 30th, before retreating slightly to its 52-week low of 211.4 GBP on August 4th. Despite this fluctuation, the stock has maintained a consistent upward trend, with its current price sitting just below its 52-week high. From a technical standpoint, Legal & General's Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) stands at 47.02, indicating that the stock is currently overvalued compared to its peers. However, its Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 3.25141 suggests that the stock is reasonably priced based on its financial health. These ratios indicate that while the stock may be expensive in terms of earnings, it remains undervalued when considering its assets and liabilities. Overall, the lack of recent news and stable historical performance suggest that Legal & General Group PLC is a reliable investment option for those seeking long-term growth potential. While the stock may be overvalued based on its P/E Ratio, its P/B Ratio indicates that it remains reasonably priced given its financial health. As such, investors may consider adding Legal & General to their watchlists or portfolios for steady returns in the months ahead.\n\n- Rentokil Initial (RTO.L) traded down -1.28 % and now trades at GBP 395.9. Rentokil Initial has a market capitalisation of GBP 9.8 bn. Rentokil Initial has a current price to earnings ratio of 24.91. Pomerantz LLP, a leading law firm specializing in corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation, has announced that they are investigating potential securities fraud claims against Rentokil Initial plc (RTO) on behalf of investors. This follows the company's recent announcement of weaker than expected sales in North America, which led to a significant decline in the company's stock price. Specifically, Rentokil disclosed that it expects full-year adjusted pretax profit of approximately £700 million, down from £766 million in the previous year, and plans to cut an undisclosed number of jobs in its US workforce to address cost overruns. As a result, the company's American Depositary Receipt (ADR) price fell by 21.04% to close at $24.95 per ADR on September 11, 2024. Pomerantz LLP is urging investors who have suffered losses to contact them to discuss their legal options.\n\n- Airlines (IAG.MC) traded down -0.24 % and now trades at GBP 214.8. Current market capitalisation for Airlines is GBP 12.6 bn. Airlines has a current price to earnings ratio of 5.02. Investing in International Consolidated Airlines (LSE: ICL) three years ago would have been a profitable move for investors. According to recent data, an initial investment of £100 would now be worth £125.52, representing a 25.52% increase in value. This growth is attributed to the company's current market capitalization of £10.45 billion and its share price of £2.13 as of November 1st, 2024. The calculation excludes dividends and stock splits, highlighting the potential gains for those who invested in the airline company's shares back in 2021.\n\n- Pentair (PNR) traded up 1.2 % and now trades at USD 101.39. Current market capitalisation for Pentair is USD 16.3 bn. Pentair has a current price to earnings ratio of 24.5. Investing in Pentair's stock three years ago would have yielded significant profits, with a return of over 34% on original investments. According to recent market data, the value of Pentair's shares has risen from $74.31 per share three years ago to $16.28 billion in current market capitalization. This growth is attributed to the company's strong performance and steady increase in share price over time. For investors who invested $10,000 in Pentair's stock three years ago, their portfolios would now be worth approximately $134,571, with a total return of $34,100.40 in profit.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Cnh Industrial\n\nCNH Industrial NV is a multinational company headquartered in London, United Kingdom.

Dollar selling from China's major state-owned banks on Tuesday to stem the yuan's decline helped cap its losses.\n\nThe offshore yuan stood at 7.2089 per dollar.\n\n'It's great to see the news. It's a necessary first step to alleviate debt burden, stimulate long term investment, and bolster stock market confidence,' said Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China.\n\nFurther rate cuts in China\n\n'In the next step, we will see if policymakers will continuously lower rates by big amount, one time big cut is not enough to reverse market expectation.'\n\nThe Aussie, often used as a liquid proxy for the yuan, fell 0.15 percent to $0.6530, while the New Zealand dollar lost 0.19 percent to $0.61385, as the move from China failed to substantially boost investor optimism.\n\nIn the broader market, the greenback rose 0.2 percent to 150.42 yen, having already surpassed the key 150 yen level for six straight sessions and prompting warnings from Japanese officials in a bid to stabilize the currency.\n\nHigher-than-expected U.S. producer prices and consumer prices data last week further scaled back market expectations of how soon, and by how much, the Federal Reserve could ease interest rates this year, with futures pointing to just about 90 basis points worth of cuts in 2024, down from about 160 bps at the end of last year.\n\nRents boost US consumer prices in Jan\n\nOn the other hand, Japan's economy, which unexpectedly slipped into a recession in the final quarter of last year on sluggish consumption and capital expenditure, has prompted investors to rethink the chances of a near-term exit by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) from its ultra-loose monetary policy.\n\nJapan's ultra-loose monetary policy\n\n'At the moment, the data coming in from Japan is telling us that it's not as rosy as what the BOJ would like to see in order to begin moving away from negative interest rates,' said Rodrigo Catril, senior currency strategist at National Australia Bank.\n\nThe euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.0768, while sterling dipped 0.13 percent to $1.25795.\n\n'We're still stuck in these ranges to some extent, and waiting for more meaningful or material data to swing us one way or the other,' said Catril. 'So for that, data coming from the U.S. remains paramount.'\n\nIn the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields ticked higher in response to last week's inflation data and the repricing of Fed expectations.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year yield was last at 4.3009 percent, while the two-year yield steadied at 4.6463 percent.\n\nThe dollar index, a measure of the greenback against its major peers, rose 0.08 percent to 104.37.\n\nDown Under, a still-cautious Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) similarly reinforced bets that rate cuts were likely still some way off, after minutes of the central bank's February meeting out on Tuesday showed policymakers need more time to be confident inflation is on the decline before it can rule out another hike in interest rates."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

These have surged due to the inclusion of the Sept. 18 U.S. Federal\nReserve policy decision, which has the potential to trigger increased FX\nrealised volatility.\n    FX volatility is an unknown, yet key parameter of an FX option premium, so\nimplied volatility is used as a stand-in.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "ANALYSIS: New entrants drive trading records in FX futuresThe Singapore Exchange last week reported a 30% increase in its FX futures franchise in the first quarter, compared to the same period in 2023, to 12.1 million contracts. USD/CNH futures, in particular, set its largest single day open interest record on March 27, at the equivalent of $18.6 billion, according to data provided by the exchange. That has been a function... New entrants at exchanges have driven new highs in listed foreign exchange markets in the first quarter, in a sign that a long-awaited shift from the much larger over-the-counter segment is finally emerging.\n\nThe Singapore Exchange (SGX) last week reported a 30% increase in its FX futures franchise in the first quarter, compared to the same period in 2023, to 12.1 million contracts. That included a 47% year-on-year increase in its largest contract, on the dollar/Renminbi (USD/CNH) currency pair, as well as a 76% increase in the equivalent Korean won contract (KRW/USD) and a 9% rise in Indian Rupee/US dollar (INR/USD) futures activity.\n\nKC Lam, the exchange's global head of FX and rates, said the spike in activity has been a function of rising market uncertainty related to geopolitical events such as elections in the region.\n\n\"A lot of investors are positioning for changes in the market driven by events such as domestic elections this year,\" Lam told FOW. \"What that has meant is record numbers in our rupee, renminbi and Korean won currency pair contracts in the quarter. This is a clear indication that FX risk management activity will be a key theme.\"\n\nAll three currencies hit open interest records in the period, as USD/CNH, INR/USD and KRW/USD futures open positions rose 55%, 114% and 391% year-on-year at the end of the quarter. USD/CNH futures, in particular, set its largest single day open interest record on March 27, at the equivalent of $18.6 billion (?15bn), according to data provided by the exchange. That has been a function of the fact that larger funds and dealers have onboarded with the Singapore venue since the roll-out of regulatory capital rules affecting asset managers and banks, Lam said.\n\n\"Throughout the last year, what we have seen were new participants coming on board and that has fed single day trading records and a rising open interest trend,\" he added. \"The interesting thing there is that we are seeing more diverse players such as macro funds and banks connecting to us.\"\n\nBeyond the Asia Pacific, Deutsche Boerse-owned Eurex has also reported an uptick in its FX futures franchise, with a 10% year-on-year increase in March trading volume to 311,330 contracts. That translated to a 16% increase for the first quarter compared to the same period in 2023 while the German exchange also hit a record open interest level of €8.2 billion (?7bn) at the end of the period, including €6.6 billion in notional in held in Euro/US dollar futures, its largest contract. The exchange said the increase has outstripped the normal uptick typical in March as clients roll their positions.\n\n\"Typically we see an effect in March where clients roll their existing exposure into the next quarter, and this year in particular what we have seen is new clients opening positions that has resulted in open interest increasing, and adoption of block trades and exchange-for-physical trades that has contributed to year-on-year volume growth,\" Tobias Rank, head of FX product sales at Eurex, said in an interview.\n\nThe growth in block trading can be seen in the green section of the bar in graph 1 below, labelled \"OTC volume\", and represents bilateral trades booked on the futures exchange.\n\nGraph 1 - March FX derivatives volume rises on Eurex\n\nSource: Eurex\n\nIn addition, Eurex at the start of March implemented a new liquidity provider scheme for its FX futures, updating incentives with new fee rebates and a revenue share for its order book liquidity providers. That should help fuel further adoption and accelerate daily liquidity in the second quarter, it said.\n\n\"Since January last year, we have seen 11 banks onboarding as clearers, with a total of 22 clearing members now live on the FX service,\" Rank added. \"That has been driven by sell-side clients extending their capabilities to meet the changes in the regulatory landscape. The next phase we are observing is those firms enabling their FX futures execution services more fully, so more tier 1 banks are joining the first movers by connecting their trading desks to execute futures with clients.\"\n\nSGX in September consolidated its wider foreign exchange and fixed income businesses into a new wholesale markets and platforms unit. That has helped the exchange capitalise on the trend towards exchange-traded contracts, Lam said.\n\n\"Within the wider SGX FX business, the off-exchange volume has certainly also begun to be redirected onto the exchange,\" he added. \"That has been driven by regulatory pressures and enabled by technology – where, for example, banks have been able to automate exchange-for-physical functionality through their portals for clients. There are lots of interesting opportunities there to further facilitate that flow.\"\n\nRival CME Group, which also consolidated its FX futures and wholesale venues into one division in August, in the first quarter reported a new record for large open interest holders in the first quarter, at 1,333 entities. The exchange, which operates the largest foreign exchange futures market, saw open interest of nearly 3 million contracts in March, 6% higher year-on-year and its highest level since November 2023, according to monthly disclosures. The exchange has cited open interest highs for its Japanese yen, Canadian dollar and Mexican Peso futures in the quarter, further reflecting the depth of the market. CME volume figures for the month of March and the first quarter were flat on last year."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Markets are worried about the Chinese yuan sparking a new wave of turmoilAug 08, 2024\n\nThe markets appear to have stabilized after melting down on Monday, but there's a new worry on the horizon in the form of the Chinese yuan.\n\nMonday's massive market selloff — the worst on the Nikkei since Black Monday 1987 — was in part triggered by the unwinding of Japanese yen carry trades.\n\n * Markets are stabilizing after Monday's selloff, but concerns are shifting to the Chinese yuan.\n * Some analysts are warning of potential yuan carry trade unwind.\n * Japan's interest-rate hike triggered a massive selloff on Monday due to the yen carry trade unwinding.\n\n\"The next carry trade unwind could be the yuan,\" Khoon Goh, the head of Asia Research at ANZ, told CNBC on Wednesday, pointing out that the offshore yuan already jumped against the dollar earlier on Monday as a kneejerk reaction to the yen carry trade unravel.\n\nThe carry trade strategy involves borrowing Japan's longstanding ultra-low interest rate environment to fund higher-yielding assets elsewhere. The Bank of Japan's rate hike last week, however, jolted the market, forcing investors who borrowed to fund their carry trades to liquidate their positions, setting off the global market rout.\n\nNow, analysts and investors are jittery about the same happening in the Chinese yuan.\n\nChina is in a low interest-rate environment as authorities are trying to boost the country's flagging economy.\n\nCitibank strategists expressed such concerns in a client note, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. They wrote there are \"positioning worries in the funding side of the carry trade, and in particular the yuan.\" Business Insider was not immediately able to reach Citi for comment.\n\nANZ's Goh said Chinese exporters have been holding onto large amounts of dollar earnings that they had been unwilling to convert due to higher rates in the US. However, they may soon be doing so as the Fed readies to cut rates — which could create \"big moves\" in the markets.\n\nThe US dollar is trading around 7.17 to the offshore yuan now after falling to below 7.1 on Monday amid the market mayhem.\n\nChina's yuan — like the yen — is weak. But it has different problems.\n\nHowever, analysts don't seem to think the fallout from the yuan carry trade would be as tumultuous as the action in the yen.\n\nVishnu Varathan, the chief economist of Asia excluding Japan at Mizuho Bank, wrote in a note on Thursday that the yuan isn't the \"next big shoe\" to drop.\n\nThat is a \"somewhat misguided view,\" given that the yen — unlike the yuan — is a deeply liquid and global currency, added Varathan. In contrast, China still guides the Chinese currency's movements.\n\nChina also has different problems than Japan.\n\nWhile the yen's weakness is due to Japan's low interest rates, the yuan's weakness is mainly due to China's \"structural economic headwinds and daunting geo-political threats,\" wrote Varathan.\n\nChina is navigating a painful economic transition from a low-value manufacturing juggernaut to its push into the hot \"new three\" industries of electric vehicles, lithium batteries, and solar cells. However, it's facing rising geopolitical tensions, including high import tariffs from the US and the EU on such high-value industries.\n\nThis means that these geopolitical risks have to fade for the yuan to strengthen and cause an impactful unraveling of the carry trade like that for the yen earlier this week, he added.\n\nGoldman Sachs' analysts share these sentiments. In a note on Wednesday, they wrote that weak Chinese growth fundamentals mean any yuan rally should be limited.\n\n\"Still-elevated carry returns, weak domestic demand in China, and our expectation of continued monetary policy easing by the PBOC are likely to drive dollar-yuan back higher,\" the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.\n\nJPMorgan estimated on Wednesday that about three-quarters of global carry trades have been unwounded so far, per Bloomberg.\n\nThe yuan's risk is further depreciation, not strength\n\nChina's economy hasn't been able to take off convincingly since the country exited nearly three years of pandemic restrictions, so it's more likely that the People's Bank of China still needs to cut rates, wrote Varathan.\n\nTherefore, the yuan's risk is — unlike the yen — one of depreciation rather than appreciation, and a yuan meltdown could trigger risk-off sentiment in the wider market, added the economist.\n\n\"While excessive volatility either way is not desirable, we fear abrupt CNY meltdown more than we do sudden CNY strength,\" wrote Varathan, referring to the yuan.\n\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index was down 0.2% at 2:32 p.m. local time on Thursday.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi was down 0.7% while Taiwan's Taiex was down 2%.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index was 0.7% higher at midday and China's CSI 300 was up 0.3%.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Despite the lack of recent news, the company's strong fundamentals suggest that it could be poised for growth in the long term. According to data from Finanzen.net, the last known news about FAS dates back to August 29th, when the company presented its quarterly results. As of September 11th, the stock has maintained a steady closing price of 25.51 CNH, with a 52-week high of 55 CNH reached on September 26th, 2023, and a 52-week low of 23.25 CNH recorded on August 28th, 2024. These figures indicate a relatively stable performance over the past year, with a slight upward trend. One key metric that stands out for FAS is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 24.49, which suggests that the market is undervaluing the company's earning potential. This is supported by the company's strong financial health, with a Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 4, indicating that the company's assets are worth significantly more than its current market value. While there have been no recent developments or announcements regarding FAS, the company's solid track record and strong financials make it an attractive investment option for those seeking long-term growth. With a history of stability and a promising future ahead, FAS could be a valuable addition to any portfolio.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Dalian Bio-chem (603360.SS) traded down -1.35 % and now trades at CNH 12.44.

Title: Technical Analysis: Hengdian Entertainment's Mixed Q2 Results Investors looking for a bargain may find Hengdian Entertainment Co Ltd (HKG:2679) an attractive option after the company released its second quarter results. While the stock has been trading below its 52-week high, the mixed bag of Q2 performance might present both opportunities and challenges for investors. * Revenue: 10.17 billion CNH (up 12% YoY) * Net Profit: 1.43 billion CNH (down 23% YoY) * EPS: 0.27 CNH (down 24% YoY) * P/E Ratio: 46.64 * P/B Ratio: 4.62 Recent Performance: Hengdian Entertainment's share price has been trending downwards since reaching its 52-week high of 21.55 CNH on December 20, 2023. The stock experienced a significant correction in September, falling by over 10% in just two days. However, the decline appears to have slowed down, with the stock stabilizing around the 10 CNH mark. Key Resistance and Support Levels: Resistance: * 12.00 CNH (50-day moving average) * 13.00 CNH (200-day moving average) Support: * 9.00 CNH (lower Bollinger band) * 8.00 CNH (previous low on September 9th) Technical Outlook: Hengdian Entertainment's chart pattern suggests a possible reversal in the near future. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached oversold levels, indicating that the sell-off may be overdone. Additionally, the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, hinting at potential buy signals. However, the stock's failure to break above key resistance levels could indicate a lack of momentum. Fundamental Outlook: While Hengdian Entertainment's revenue growth remains strong, its net profit margin has been under pressure due to increased production costs. The company's decision to reduce its stake in subsidiary Hengdian Film & TV Productions may also impact its bottom line. Nevertheless, the company's solid balance sheet and cash flow generation provide some stability. Conclusion: Hengdian Entertainment's mixed Q2 results and recent price action suggest a cautious approach for investors. Although the stock's valuation looks appealing compared to its historical averages, the company's fundamental outlook is less certain. Traders may consider waiting for a clearer sign of a turnaround before entering long positions or taking advantage of the current price level for short selling.\n\n- Appotronics (688007.SS) traded down -4.11 % and now trades at CNY 11.98.

However, the stock has yet to reach its 52 weeks high of 32.17 CNY, which was achieved on November 15th, 2023. In terms of valuation ratios, Appotronics' Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at an impressive 152.365, indicating that the market has high expectations for the company's future growth prospects. Additionally, the Price to Book (P/B) ratio of 2.30972 suggests that the company's shares are undervalued compared to its peers. Outlook and Potential Growth Drivers Given the strong fundamentals of Appotronics' business and the promising outlook for the technology sector, analysts predict that the company's stock could continue to trend upwards in the near future. The successful launch of the New Smart #5 and any potential follow-up innovations could provide a significant boost to the company's revenue and profitability. Furthermore, the increasing demand for smart technologies and the growing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) bode well for Appotronics' long-term growth prospects. As more consumers turn to eco-friendly transportation solutions, the need for advanced technology components like those provided by Appotronics is likely to surge.

The State Council\nInformation Office, which handles media queries for the\ngovernment, did not also immediately respond to a request for\ncomment. \n    \n    \n    Allowing the yuan to depreciate next year would deviate from\nthe usual practice of keeping the foreign exchange rate stable,\nthe sources said.\n    The tightly managed yuan is allowed to move 2% on either\nside of a daily mid-point fixed by the central bank. Policy\ncomments from top officials typically include commitments to\nkeeping the yuan stable.\n    While the central bank is unlikely to say it will no longer\nuphold the currency, it will emphasize allowing the markets more\npower in deciding the yuan's value, one source with knowledge of\nthe matter said. \n    At a meeting this week of the Politburo, a decision-making\nbody of Communist Party officials, China pledged to adopt an\n\"appropriately loose\" monetary policy next year, marking the\nfirst such easing of its policy stance in some 14 years.\n    The comments did not include a reference to the need for a\n\"basically stable yuan\", which was last mentioned in July but\nmissing in the September readout, too.\n    Yuan policy has figured heavily in financial analysts' notes\nand other think-tank discussions this year. \n    In a paper published by leading thinktank China Finance 40\nForum last week, analysts suggested China should temporarily\nswitch from anchoring the yuan to the U.S dollar to linking it\ninstead to a basket of non-dollar currencies, particularly the\neuro, to ensure the exchange rate is flexible during a period of\ntrade tensions. \n    A second source privy to the central bank's thinking told\nReuters the PBOC has considered the possibility the yuan could\ndrop to 7.5-per-dollar to counteract any trade shocks. \n    That's a roughly 3.5% depreciation from current levels\naround 7.25.\n    During Trump's first term as president, the yuan weakened\nmore than 12% against the dollar during a series of tit-for-tat\ntariff announcements between March 2018 and May 2020.\n    \n    DIFFICULT CHOICE\n    A weaker yuan could help the world’s second-biggest economy\nas it seeks to reach what is expected to be a challenging 5%\neconomic growth target and relieve deflationary pressures by\nboosting export earnings and making imported goods more\nexpensive.\n    A sharp downturn in exports would give further cause for\nauthorities to try and use the currency to protect the one\nsector of the economy that has been doing well.\n    China's exports slowed sharply and imports unexpectedly\nshrank in November, spurring calls for more policy support to\nprop up domestic demand.\n    \"To be fair, it is a policy option. Currency adjustments are\non the table as a tool to be used to mitigate the effects of\ntariffs,\" said HSBC's chief Asia economist Fred Neumann.\n    But that would be a short-sighted policy choice, he said.\n    \"If China takes the currency aggressively lower, it raises\nthe risk of a tariff cascade and other nations then essentially\nsay, well, if the Chinese currency is weakening dramatically,\nthen we may not have a choice to impose import restrictions on\ngoods from China ourselves,\" Neumann said.\n    \"So there is a bit of a risk here that if China uses its\ncurrency angle too aggressively, it could lead to a backlash\namong other trading partners and that's not in the interest of\nChina.\"              \n     Analysts' average forecast is for the yuan to fall to 7.37\nper dollar by the end of next year, though a key factor will be\nhow much Trump raises tariffs and how quickly.\n        The currency has lost nearly 4% of its value against the\ndollar since the end of September as investors positioned for a\nTrump presidency. \n    The central bank has in the past contained volatility and\ndisorderly moves in the yuan through its daily guidance rate to\nmarkets and through state banks’ buying and selling of the\ncurrency.    \n     The yuan, or renminbi (RMB) as it is sometimes known, has\nstruggled since 2022, weighed down by an anaemic economy and a\ndrop in foreign capital inflows into China's markets.

Both rates are at historic lows, underscoring the nation's fragile economic recovery. The decision followed mixed economic data from China for April, which showed sustained industrial output growth, a five-month low jobless rate, and a slow performance in retail turnover. Last week, the PBoC also maintained the medium-term lending rate at 2.5%, as part of its ongoing efforts to stabilize the yuan.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial trades 2.74 percent higher on Friday 27th of SeptemberSep 26, 2024\n\nShandong Bohui Paper Industrial (600966.SS) traded up 2.74 % during a 24 hours period ending at 03:37 AM Central Europe on Friday 27th. One Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial stock can currently be bought for about CNY 4.3 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial stocks is 1.2 bn. Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial has a current market capitalization of CNY 5.1 bn and approximately CNY 86.2 mn worth of Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial has traded 0.49 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 5.26. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 7.17 on 10/31/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 3.61 on 09/18/2024.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion (603583.SS) traded down -0.25 % and now trades at CNY 16.69. Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion has a market capitalisation of CNY 6.1 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is 18.89. Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Shaanxi Heimao Coking (601015.SS) traded up 0.69 % and now trades at CNY 3.03.

Cwb Automotive Electronics has a market capitalisation of CNY 6 bn. Cwb Automotive Electronics has a current price to earnings ratio of 23.27. Title: CWB Automotive Electronics: Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain a foothold in the booming automotive electronics market may want to take a closer look at CWB Automotive Electronics Co Ltd (CWEB), a Chinese firm that has been making waves with its innovative technology solutions. Despite a lack of recent news, a technical analysis of the company's performance paints a mixed picture of its potential. Current Price and Past Performance As of September 24th, 2024, CWEB's last closed price stood at 14.9 CNY, down from its 52-week high of 24.59 CNY recorded on November 28th, 2023. However, this decline has not deterred investors, as the stock has still seen significant growth over the past year, with a 52-week range of 11.3 CNY to 24.59 CNY. This volatility suggests that the company's future performance could be influenced by various factors, including changes in consumer demand and technological advancements. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio One key metric that investors often consider when evaluating CWEB's performance is its price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio). Currently standing at 23.27, this figure indicates that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its peers, suggesting that investors have high expectations for the company's future earnings growth. Additionally, CWEB's price to book ratio (P/B ratio) of 3.28221 implies that the stock is undervalued based on its assets, which could be an attractive opportunity for value investors. Technical Indicators When examining CWEB's chart patterns, several technical indicators provide insights into the company's short-term and long-term prospects. For instance, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 61.8%, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal remains bullish, with a positive crossover hinting at continued upward momentum. However, the Stochastic Oscillator reveals that the stock is approaching overbought territory, which could lead to a correction or consolidation period in the near future. Conclusion While CWEB's recent lack of news may raise concerns among investors, a technical analysis of the company's performance highlights both positive and negative signals. With a premium P/E ratio and undervalued P/B ratio, the stock appears to be attractively priced for those willing to take on some risk. However, the stock's volatility and approach to overbought territory suggest caution may be warranted before jumping into the fray. As such, investors should carefully weigh these factors before making any decisions regarding their investment strategy.\n\n- Zhongnongfa Seed Industry (600313.SS) traded up 0.55 % and now trades at CNY 5.64.

There is precedent for an LPR cut without an MLF reduction; it\nlast happened in May 2022 when the five-year LPR was slashed by 15 basis points.\n    Interestingly, that policy easing came not long after then-Premier Li\nKeqiang's exhortations. It marked the largest cut since the interest rate\nmechanism was revamped in 2019.  \n    A 15 to 20 bps rate cut on Tuesday could give a boost to the struggling\nproperty sector, broader Chinese capital markets, and by extension, the yuan.\nThat would reassure Chinese policymakers unwilling to cut benchmark interest\nrates for fear of triggering currency depreciation.\n    While official Lunar New Year travel data offered hints of pent-up\nconsumption demand, caution is warranted in interpretation due to the slightly\nlonger holiday this year. Chinese consumer sentiment remains fragile, keeping\nalive fears of Japan's dreaded deflationary cycle, unless more aggressive\nstimulus measures are deployed.\n    For more click on [FXBUZ] \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nCN5YLPR:     https://tmsnrt.rs/3UKCCtd\nRMBindex:     https://tmsnrt.rs/48hUYoB\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Ewen Chew is a Reuters market analyst.

Following Donald Trump's clear victory over Kamala Harris in the US presidential election, accompanied by a full Republican \"Red Sweep\" in Congress, US futures, Treasury yields, and the Dollar all surged sharply higher. Markets are responding favorably to expansionary fiscal policies, tax cuts, and a pro-growth agenda under the new administration. Major European indexes also rose, despite warnings from some analysts that Trump's return may be an economic \"nightmare\" for Europe.\n\nIn currency markets, Dollar has jumped to a clear leadership position. Euro and Yen are currently the weakest performers, followed by Swiss Franc and Sterling. Loonie is holding second place, benefiting from its close economic ties with the US, while risk-on sentiment has kept both Kiwi and Aussie relatively resilient.\n\nAttention now shifts to tomorrow's rate decisions by BoE and Fed. Both central banks are widely expected to implement a 25 bps rate cut in response to softer inflationary pressures. BoE's new economic projections, which will be released with the rate decision, could offer more clarity on the pace of policy easing going forward. For Fed, probability of another rate cut in December has slipped below 70%, as indicated by fed funds futures, reflecting increased market uncertainty.\n\nTechnically, USD/CNH also surged sharply higher today following broad based Dollar strength. Current development affirms the case that whole corrective fall from 7.3679 has completed with three waves down to 6.9709. Near term outlook will stay bullish as long as 7.0860 support holds. Next target is 7.3111 resistance. Extended weakness in offshore Yuan could exert some pressure on Chinese and Hong Kong stocks, with risk of dragging down Aussie and Kiwi.\n\nIn Europe, at the time of writing, FTSE is up 0.88%. DAX is up 0.41%. CAC is up 0.88%. UK 10-year yield is up 0.027 at 4.557. Germany 10-year yield is down -0.019 at 2.410. Earlier in Asia, Nikkei rose 2.61%. Hong Kong HSI fell -2.23%. China Shanghai SSE fell -0.09%. Singapore Strait Times rose 0.60%. Japan 10-year JGB yield rose 0.0516.\n\nEurozone PPI down -0.6% mom in Step, led by energy prices\n\nEurozone's PPI decreased by -0.6% mom in September, slightly exceeding the expected decline of -0.5% mom. On an annual basis, PPI fell by -3.4% yoy, marginally less than the anticipated -3.5% yoy drop.\n\nThe monthly decline in Eurozone PPI was primarily driven by a significant -1.9% mom decrease in energy prices. Intermediate goods prices remained stable, while capital goods saw a slight decrease of -0.1% mom. In contrast, prices for both durable and non-durable consumer goods increased by 0.2% mom.\n\nAcross the broader EU, PPI also dropped by -0.6% mom and -3.3% yoy. Among member states, Estonia, Spain, and Romania led the monthly declines with falls of -3.6%, -2.4%, and -2.2%, respectively, while Ireland recorded a significant 4.8% increase, followed by Finland and Greece with more modest gains of 1.0% and 0.7%.\n\nEurozone PMI services finalized at 51.6, PMI composite at 50.0\n\nEurozone PMI Services for October was finalized at 51.6, up from September's 51.4. PMI Composite also moved to 50.0 from 49.6, indicating stagnation rather than expansion across the region. The services sector continues to play a vital role in keeping Eurozone's economy afloat, yet concerns of a Q4 contraction remain.\n\nSpain topped the Eurozone with PMI Composite of 55.2, while Ireland followed at 52.. Italy's index reached 51.0, a four-month high. Meanwhile, Germany's reading improved to 48.6, still in contraction but at a three-month high. France recorded an eight-month low of 48.1.\n\nCyrus de la Rubia, Chief Economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, remarked, \"The modest expansion of the services sector has been crucial in keeping the currency union out of recession.\" He highlighted that declining inflation and higher wages are likely bolstering consumer spending, which sustains demand in services. However, de la Rubia pointed out that their GDP Nowcast for Q4 indicates a \"slight contraction\" in overall Eurozone output.\n\nDe la Rubia also noted that structural issues, such as labor shortages which exert upward wage pressures, continue to keep inflation elevated. \"The ECB will find it \"difficult, if not impossible\", to achieve the 2% inflation target in a sustainable manner in this environment,\" he added.\n\nBoJ minutes: Yen stabilization gives time to monitor global economic risks\n\nMinutes [https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmsche_minu/minu_2024/g240920.pdf] from BoJ's September meeting reveal a careful stance on monetary policy amid global economic uncertainties. At the meeting, BoJ kept its interest rate steady at 0.25%.\n\nRegarding future direction of monetary policy, members broadly agreed that if Japan's economic and inflation outlook aligns with their projections, the Bank would \"continue to raise the policy interest rate\" and gradually adjust its level of monetary accommodation.\n\nThe minutes also underscore the need for \"high vigilance\" given uncertainties in overseas economies, particularly in the US, and ongoing volatility in global financial markets.\n\nSome members pointed out that recent retracements in Yen's depreciation have moderated upside risk to inflation from import prices. Given this development, they noted that the Bank has \"enough time\" to evaluate the effects of global economic shifts and recent policy rate hikes before deciding on further moves.\n\nJapan's PMI services finalized at 49.7, first contraction since Jun\n\nJapan's services sector slipped into contraction in October, with PMI Services index finalized at 49.7, down from September's 53.1 and marking its first contraction since June. PMI Composite also declined to 49.6 from 52.0, signaling a contraction in private sector activity for the first time in four months and the lowest reading since November 2023.\n\nAccording to Usamah Bhatti, Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, the services sector's performance \"came to an abrupt halt\" at the start of Q4. While the decline was modest, it was driven by a notable slowdown in new business inflows, particularly in export orders. Despite the dip, businesses maintained a positive outlook, though optimism weakened to its lowest in over two-and-a-half years, with companies citing concerns over labor shortages as a key factor.\n\nThe services sector slowdown, combined with a continuing contraction in manufacturing, contributed to the steepest private sector contraction in nearly a year. New order inflows stagnated, particularly impacted by weakened demand in manufacturing order books. Business sentiment, overall, has also softened, with optimism now at its lowest since January 2021.\n\nNZ employment falls -0.5% in Q3, unemployment rate rises to 4.8%\n\nNew Zealand's labor market showed signs of cooling in Q3, with employment falling by -0.5% qoq, in line with expectations. Unemployment rate rose from 4.6 to 4.8%, slightly better than the anticipated 5.0%, but still indicative of softening labor conditions.\n\nLabor force participation rate also declined, dropping from 71.7% to 71.2%, while the employment rate slipped from 68.4% to 67.8%, reflecting fewer people actively engaged in the workforce.\n\nOn the wage front, growth showed deceleration. The labor cost index, which includes salary and wage rates with overtime, rose by 3.8% yoy, down from the previous quarter's 4.3% yoy increase.\n\nThe slowdown in wage growth suggests some relief in wage-driven inflation pressures, which could factor into RBNZ's upcoming rate cut.\n\nUSD/JPY Mid-Day Outlook\n\nDaily Pivots: (S1) 151.12; (P) 151.83; (R1) 152.32; More... [http://www.actionforex.com/markets/pivot-points]\n\nIntraday bias in USD/JPY remains on the upside for the moment. Current rally from 139.57 should target 61.8% projection of 141.63 to 153.87 from 151.27 at 158.83. For now, outlook will remain bullish as long as 151.27 support holds, in case of retreat.\n\nIn the bigger picture, price actions from 161.94 are seen as a corrective pattern to rise from 102.58 (2021 low). The range of medium term consolidation should be set between 38.2% retracement of 102.58 to 161.94 at 139.26 and 161.94. Nevertheless, sustained break of 139.26 would open up deeper medium term decline to 61.8% retracement at 125.25.\n\nEconomic Indicators Update\n\nGMT     CCY   EVENTS                           ACT      F/C      PP       REV     \n21:45   NZD   Employment Change Q3             -0.50%   -0.50%   0.40%    0.20%   \n21:45   NZD   Unemployment Rate Q3             4.80%    5.00%    4.60%    \n21:45   NZD   Labour Cost Index Q/Q Q3         0.60%    0.70%    0.90%    \n23:50   JPY   BoJ Minutes                      \n00:30   JPY   Services PMI Oct F               49.7     49.3     49.3     \n07:00   EUR   Germany Factory Orders M/M Sep   4.20%    1.80%    -5.80%   \n08:50   EUR   France Services PMI Oct F        49.2     48.3     48.3     \n08:55   EUR   Germany Services PMI Oct F       51.6     51.4     51.4     \n09:00   EUR   Eurozone Services PMI Oct F      51.6     51.2     51.2     \n09:30   GBP   Construction PMI Oct             54.3     55.3     57.2     \n10:00   EUR   Eurozone PPI M/M Sep             -0.60%   -0.50%   0.60%    \n10:00   EUR   Eurozone PPI Y/Y Sep             -3.40%   -3.50%   -2.30%   \n15:00   CAD   Ivey PMI Oct                     54.2     53.1     \n15:30   USD   Crude Oil Inventories            -0.5M    \n\nThe views expressed in content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex et al.

SWIFT is a global provider of financial messaging services. \n\n China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is the largest market for offshore yuan transactions, taking up 76.18 percent, followed by the UK at 6.16 percent and Singapore at 3.76 percent, the report said. \n\n The data shows that the yuan is becoming increasingly popular as more countries are willing to use the Chinese currency in cross-border trade settlement, conduct cross-border investment and financing, and sign currency swap deals with China, Xi Junyang, a professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Thursday. \n\n With solid efforts to promote yuan's internationalization in recent years, China has seen a strengthened role of the yuan across the board, from international payment and settlement, investment and financing, and reserves to pricing. \n\n As of the end of August, the People's Bank of China (PBC), the country's central bank, signed bilateral currency swap agreements with 42 foreign central banks or monetary authorities. A total of 29 bilateral currency swap agreements are in force, with a total scale of about 4.1 trillion yuan ($561.72 billion), the Xinhua News Agency reported, citing a PBC report. \n\n The PBC stressed at a meeting on Monday that the central bank will steadily boost financial reform and high-level opening-up next. It said efforts will be made to promote the internationalization of the yuan in a careful and robust manner, further enhance its functions as an international currency for cross-border payments, investment and financing, reserves and other functions. Meanwhile, the central bank will strengthen the competitiveness of the yuan cross-border payment system. \n\n The internationalization of the yuan is an important part of China's financial opening-up. Looking ahead, efforts are needed in several aspects to boost the yuan's internationalization, Xi said. He said the country should continue to expand opening-up, strengthen connect programs with other markets, and facilitate convenience in cross-border investment and fund-raising. \n\n As an increasingly international currency, the yuan is able to maintain a stable exchange rate in the future thanks to multiple favorable factors, including the central government's supportive macroeconomic policies that have improved market expectations, sustained economic recovery and foreign exchange market resilience. \n\n\nCopyright Global Times.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Jiangsu Hsc New Energy Materials trades 2.77 percent higher on Friday 27th of SeptemberSep 27, 2024\n\nJiangsu Hsc New Energy Materials (688353.SS) traded up 2.77 % during a 24 hours period ending at 10:16 AM Central Europe on Friday 27th. One Jiangsu Hsc New Energy Materials stock can currently be bought for about CNY 17.35 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Jiangsu Hsc New Energy Materials stocks is 153.5 mn. Jiangsu Hsc New Energy Materials has a current market capitalization of CNY 2.5 bn and approximately CNY 16.2 mn worth of Jiangsu Hsc New Energy Materials was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Jiangsu Hsc New Energy Materials has traded 8.13 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 21.25. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 32.2 on 10/12/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 14.45 on 08/23/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Jiangsu Hsc New Energy Materials\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: Jiangsu HSC New Energy Materials' Price Plummets Despite Strong Fundamentals In a surprising turn of events, Jiangsu HSC New Energy Materials Co Ltd (SHE: 688718) has seen its stock price plummet despite strong fundamentals. As of yesterday's closing bell, the company's shares were trading at 15.91 CNY, down from its 52-week high of 32.2 CNY reached on October 11th, 2023. This sharp decline has left many investors scratching their heads, particularly given the company's solid financial performance. A closer look at Jiangsu HSC's financials reveals that the company has been consistently posting impressive revenue growth over the past year. In fact, its latest quarterly results showed a staggering 45% increase in net income compared to the same period last year. Moreover, the company's price-to-earnings ratio stands at an attractive -20.29, indicating that the market may be undervaluing its potential for future growth. Another positive factor worth noting is Jiangsu HSC's strong balance sheet, with a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.661802. This suggests that the company has ample room to maneuver and invest in new opportunities without being weighed down by excessive debt. Given these strengths, it's puzzling why Jiangsu HSC's stock price has been trending downward since August 22nd, when it hit a 52-week low of 14.45 CNY. One possible explanation could be the broader market volatility caused by geopolitical tensions and changing monetary policies. However, it's important to note that Jiangsu HSC's fundamentals remain robust, making this dip a potentially lucrative buying opportunity for long-term investors. In conclusion, while Jiangsu HSC's stock price may have lost some steam recently, the company's underlying strengths suggest that this could be a temporary setback. Savvy investors looking for a promising long-term play might want to take advantage of this discounted price and consider adding Jiangsu HSC to their portfolios.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Eging Photovoltaic (600537.SS) traded up 1.99 % and now trades at CNY 2.71. Current market capitalisation for Eging Photovoltaic is CNY 3 bn.\n\n- Beken (603068.SS) traded up 1.19 % and now trades at CNY 21.23. Beken has a market capitalisation of CNY 3 bn. Beken Corp: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Despite lacking recent news, Beken Corp's (BEK) financial performance continues to garner attention. As of yesterday's closing bell, BEK stock closed at 17.41 CNH, down from its 52-week high of 33.31 CNH recorded on November 14th, 2023. However, this figure remains above the 52-week low of 15.79 CNH hit on February 6th, 2024. A closer look at BEK's price-to-earnings ratio (-32.73) and price-to-book ratio (1.62) reveals a mixed picture. While the former suggests that investors may be overvaluing the company, the latter indicates that shares are undervalued compared to their book value. This discrepancy could be due to market expectations of future growth or other factors affecting the company's profitability. In terms of short-term trends, BEK has been trading sideways since mid-June, with limited volatility. This stability might indicate a consolidation period following the significant gains experienced during the previous year. However, a breakout above 18.50 CNH could signal a bullish reversal, while a drop below 16.50 CNH could trigger selling pressure. Overall, the lack of recent news and mixed technical indicators suggest caution when considering an investment in Beken Corp. Savvy investors may want to monitor the company's progress and wait for clarity before making any decisions.\n\n- Square (603339.SS) traded up 1.65 % and now trades at CNY 10.23.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "April 16 (Reuters) - China's offshore yuan fell sharply after the\nPeople's Bank of China allowed the daily USD/CNY midpoint to rise by a slightly\nbigger extent on Tuesday. Key Chinese economic data released shortly after\nprompted a mild yuan recovery, but it still looks shaky.\n    CNH notched its weakest level against the USD in five months as USD/CNH hit\n7.2831, clearing a technical resistance level around 7.2680.

While the\ndeviation from neutral forecasts was still significant at around -1450 pips, the\nmarket took the biggest daily rise in the midpoint since March 22 as a hint of\nauthorities allowing the yuan to weaken.\n    China's Q1 GDP data soundly beat forecasts and Q4 GDP was revised higher,\nbut the big miss in March industrial output and retail sales, and a steep\ndecline in property investment curbed any fledgling optimism for the economy.\nMarch new home prices also fell at their fastest since 2015.\n    Given the swirling negativity for China's economic recovery, punters\ncontinue to pile into crowded yuan shorts.

However, Chinese concept stocks continued to\nfall\n\novernight, including Tencent (00700), which had mixed quarterly results. The\nHang Seng\n\nIndex maintained trading during the first severe weather. The day opened lower\nby 197\n\npoints or 1%. However, driven by the rise of Tencent during the session, the\nHang Seng\n\nIndex once rose by up to 36 points to 19,859 points. However, the 50-day\nmoving average\n\n(approximately 19,809 points) clearly saw resistance and HSI soon returned to\ndecline.\n\nMainland properties rose first and then retreated. Gambling stocks and Chinese\nconcept\n\nstocks fell significantly, dragging the Hang Seng Index down 173 points or\n0.9% in half a\n\nday to 19,649.\n\nTrading was still smooth despite the bad weather, but the main board turnover\nshrank to\n\nnearly HKD 81.5 billion, a day-to-day drop of more than 20%.\n\nThe Hang Seng China Enterprises Index reported at 7,060, down 69 points or 1%.\nThe Hang\n\nSeng Tech Index reported at 4,392, down 63 points or 1.4%.\n\n\"The next wave of central government bailout will wait until Trump takes\noffice\"\n\nThe Hang Seng Index had fallen for four consecutive days, falling by more than\n1,100\n\npoints. Today, the Hang Seng Index opened nearly 200 points lower. Cheung Chi\nWai, a joint\n\nmanaging director at Prudential Brokerage Ltd, told ET Net News Agency that\nthe recent\n\nweak trend of the Hang Seng Index is mainly affected by negative factors such\nas the\n\ncontinued decline of the offshore RMB and the increasing tension in Sino-US\nrelations. He\n\npointed out that from signals such as TSMC stopping selling 7nm chips to\nChina, it can be\n\nseen that Sino-US trade friction is expected to become more intense. Tencent\nopened lower\n\nin the morning market and then rebounded, rising 1.58% in half a day to HKD\n410.2, making\n\nit the best performing blue chip currently.\n\nUnder the influence of many negative factors, he believes that the Hang Seng\nIndex has\n\nnow fallen below the gap level on 26 September (approximately 19,954). It is\nexpected that\n\nthe Hang Seng Index will repeatedly fall downwards and may bottom out at the\n100-day\n\nmoving average (approximately 18,663). As for whether the Hang Seng Index has\na chance to\n\nrise again in the short term, he said that it depends on whether the central\ngovernment\n\nwill introduce bailout measures. Now the market is also waiting for the next\nstep of the\n\ncentral government. However, he believes that the measures may need to wait\nuntil Trump\n\ntaking office in 2025. It remains on hold now and has entered a period of\npolicy\n\nobservation.\n\nData released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday (13th)\nshowed that the\n\nU.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.6% year-on-year in October, 0.2\npercentage\n\npoints higher than the previous value, in line with market expectations and\nincreasing the\n\nmarket's confidence that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest\nrates. He said\n\nthat since CPI is in line with market expectations, it has less impact on the\nHang Seng\n\nIndex. Based on the CPI and inflation data, he expects the Federal Reserve to\nslow down\n\nthe pace of future interest rate cuts, and may not cut interest rates in\nDecember. The\n\ninterest rate cut in 2025 will need to wait until Trump officially takes\noffice.\n\n\"Tencent's games are not performing well, but there are short-term speculation\n\nopportunities\"\n\nTencent announced its third quarter results as of the end of September this\nyear, with\n\nnon-IFRS profits of RMB 59.813 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 33%\nand a\n\nquarter-to-quarter increase of 4%, far exceeding market expectations of RMB\n54.37 billion.\n\nHowever, the game business, which is the most concerned aspect of the market,\nfell short\n\nof market expectations. Revenue from value-added service business increased by\n9%\n\nyear-on-year to RMB 82.7 billion during the quarter. Earlier, many major\nbanks, including\n\nJPMorgan, Nomura, CICC, Citi, etc., expected this business grew by more than\n10% in the\n\nthird quarter.\n\nCheung Chi Wai believes that Tencent's performance is good. Although the game\nbusiness\n\ndoes not meet market expectations, Tencent's earnings per share still grow\nstrongly. He\n\ncontinued to point out that Tencent's stock price outperformed the same sector\nthis\n\nmorning, indicating that the market recognized Tencent's performance. As for\nthe game\n\nbusiness revenue not meeting expectations, he pointed out that it was mainly\naffected by\n\nthe downgrade of consumption in the general environment and the high\nunemployment rate\n\namong young people. The number of people willing to top-up and the amount of\ntop-up have\n\ndeclined.\n\nRegarding Tencent's short-term trend, he said that yesterday Tencent slightly\nfell below\n\nHKD 400 (about HKD 396), and today it fell first and then rebounded. From the\ntechnical\n\ntrend, it is expected that the 10-day moving average will break through the\n20-day moving\n\naverage at about HKD 418, forming a golden cross. There will be an increase of\nHKD 6 to 8\n\nin the short term."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "EUR/USD Extends Recovery But Don't Expect It To Last - Here's WhyNov 26, 2024\n\nImage Source: Pixabay  \n\nThe euro rebounded after an initial drop, as Trump made no immediate tariff threats against eurozone exports. While his warnings appear to be negotiation tactics ahead of his January 20 inauguration, markets remain highly reactive to headlines, creating volatile trading conditions. Despite appointing Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary, Trump’s potential use of executive orders underscores his direct leadership style. The brief cooling of the \"Trump Trade,\" characterised by a strong dollar and Bitcoin rally, may not last. For now, the euro is gaining short-term relief, though the EUR/USD forecast remains modestly bearish.  \n\nOutlook far from ideal for euro\n\nOvernight we saw a big shake up in the FX space as currencies of Mexico, Canada, and China all came under pressure. Only one man could cause such a stir, and it was no other than President-elect Donald Trump, who threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada unless they step up border security against illegal immigration, and to curb Fentanyl inflows from China. Relieved that there were no immediate mentions against eurozone exports, the euro managed to bounce back after a quick drop. While this move appears to be a negotiation tactic from Trump ahead of his January 20 inauguration, the market will increasingly become headline-driven and make for tricky trading conditions. Still, despite appointing a perceived safe pair of hands in Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary, one should not take lightly Trump’s verbal warnings as he could use executive orders to pass them through law. Indeed, if you recall from my note on Monday, I warned that Trump will be the ultimate boss and will lead from the front. And overnight he did really remind us who the boss was. Therefore, the slight cooling of the so-called \"Trump Trade,\" i.e., with a strong dollar cooling as we have seen thus far in the week (except against CAD and CNH that were hit by Trump’s tariff threat overnight), may not last long. But today, the euro is finding itself on the front foot amid the relief bounce that commenced from end of last week from severely technical oversold levels. While the recovery may end up lasting for a while, the EUR/USD outlook remains modestly bearish.  \n\nEuro rebound could be short-lived \n\nThis week, we haven’t got much in the way of Eurozone date. On Monday, the German Ifo Business Climate survey offered new insights into business sentiment. Following last week’s weak PMI data, a positive surprise seemed unlikely, and the results confirmed this. The survey came in at 85.7, below both the previous 86.5 and expectations of 86.1.\n\nThe euro’s recent struggles underscore investor concerns about the economic outlook in the Eurozone and China, as well as trade uncertainties in 2025 following Trump’s US election victory.\n\nTraders are closely monitoring eurozone data for improvement, but without positive signs, the euro may remain under pressure despite a strong start to the week. Last week’s composite PMI fell from 50 to 48.1, indicating contraction, with both services and manufacturing slowing. Weak export demand and declining business sentiment add to the gloom. While third-quarter GDP showed growth, fourth-quarter stagnation now appears likely, reinforcing a bearish euro sentiment.  \n\nWhat about US dollar and data? \n\nWhile it may have lost some momentum, the dollar has been on a strong bullish trend until the start of this week. But it is by no means it is the end of the bullish trend. Traders have been betting on Trump’s fiscal policies, including sweeping trade tariffs and measures to boost economic growth. The dollar index had risen for eight straight weeks through Friday. The momentum is thus quite strong and so this dollar weakness may prove to be short-lived, preventing the EUR/USD from turning bullish just yet.\n\nThis is a shortened week due to Thanksgiving. Today’s data highlights on the US economic calendar include CB Consumer Confidence (expected to show an improvement to 111.8 from 108.7 last), New Home Sales, Richmond Manufacturing Index and FOMC minutes. On Wednesday, ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, the US will release a flurry of data, including the second estimate of Q3 GDP, core PCE inflation, unemployment claims and durable goods orders.\n\nThese reports could significantly influence the short-term EUR/USD direction, but it may not have any long-term impact as everyone is focused on what Trump will mean for the dollar next year. With many investors likely stepping away for the long holiday weekend, Friday could be a quieter day.    \n\nEUR/USD technical analysis and key levels to watch\n\nSource: TradingView.com\n\nThe fact that the EUR/USD has so far refused to hold below last year’s low of 1.0448 is a modestly positive sign, if it can hang around these levels. But the series of lower lows and lower highs should remind you that we that we have seen such recovery attempts only to be engulfed frequently by even sharper sell-off periods. Thus, without a solid technical evidence that rates have bottomed out, we could be in another such environment: corrective phase inside a larger bear trend. The EUR/USD is therefore far from bullish from a purely technical point of view, just yet.\n\nIf the EUR/USD manages to build a base now around the 1.0450-1.0500 area (shaded in grey on the chart), then we may see it climb back towards the next resistance at 1.0600, and even higher towards the more significant hurdle around 1.0700 area. But if it goes back below that 1.0450-1.0500 area, then for me that would be the clearest indication yet that traders want to see even lower levels such as 1.0300, 1.0200 and so on.\n\nMore By This Author:\n\nGold Drops On Bessent Appointment But Bears Face Lots Of Hurdles S&P 500 At Pivotal Zone EUR/USD Under Pressure From Multiple Sources But Clings On To $1.05 For Now"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

However, these higher\npremiums can be advantageous for more exotic type options.  \n    A regular vanilla call option with a strike at 1.0600 and expiry in 1-month\nwould cost 60 USD pips, or 33 USD pips with the strike at 1.05 and 17 USD pips\nwith the strike at 1.0400 (break-even is the strike minus the premium). However,\nthe additional implied volatility premium for downside strikes will cheapen\noptions with a knock-out trigger below the strike as that trigger is deemed more\nlikely to be touched and kill the option.  \n    For example, a 1-month expiry 1.0600 USD call with a knock out trigger at\n1.0300 is half the price of its vanilla equivalent, albeit dead if 1.0300\ntrades. Longer expiries and triggers closer to strike/current spot will be even\ncheaper.   \n    Alternatively, vanilla EUR put/USD call spreads allow holders to sell\nEUR/USD at one strike providing they buy at another below it. They are similar\nto KO-trigger options in that they are cheaper and profit potential is limited\nto the lower strike, but remain in play until expiry.\n   \n          \n    For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n1-3-month expiry EUR/USD risk reversals    https://tmsnrt.rs/3Q4oF6q\n1-month EUR/USD FXO implied vs 1-month daily realised volatility    https://tmsnrt.rs/3xB3Ysp\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Outlook for yuan assets stable amid global volatility: analystsAs global markets encountered tremendous volatility in recent days, Chinese markets remained relatively stable, with the yuan strengthening against the US dollar, and the outlook for yuan-denominated assets remains bright, Chinese analysts said on Tuesday.Amid concerns over a potential recession in the US economy, China's economy is expected to rebound steadily despite downward pressure, as more policy measures will likely offer strong support, which in turn will further improve the attractiveness of yuan-denominated assets for global investors, analysts noted. Following a widespread sell-off on Monday, Asian stocks bounced back on Tuesday. Japan's main stock index, the Nikkei, gained more than 10 percent, rebounding sharply from a record loss of 12.4 percent on Monday. In South Korea, the Kospi rose 3.5 percent on Tuesday, following an 8.8 percent drop on Monday.On the Chinese mainland, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.23 percent on Tuesday, while the smaller Shenzhen Component Index gained 0.82 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index was down 0.31 percent on Tuesday.Notably, the yuan saw remarkable gains in recent days. On Monday, the onshore yuan reached a seven-month high of 7.1120 against the US dollar, while the offshore yuan reached a high of 7.0636, according to Reuters. While the yuan eased somewhat on Tuesday, it remained relatively strong, with the central parity rate strengthening 27 pips to 7.1318 against the US dollar, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.Compared with record losses and gains overseas, Chinese markets remained relatively stable and will likely attract more global investors, analysts noted.Cheng Shi, chief economist of ICBC International, said that Chinese stocks have been under pressure amid some capital outflows, but as overseas markets undergo corrections, some global capital will likely return. \"We are cautiously optimistic about A-share stocks and Hong Kong stocks,\" Cheng told the Global Times, noting that recent top policy meetings in China have emphasized achieving the annual growth targets, and various policy measures will offer support for Chinese stocks. \"It is expected that more supportive policies will be rolled out, which will help form a policy-catalyzed market trend.\" Analysts also said that as Chinese policymakers are expected to continue to support the economic recovery, the yuan's exchange rate will remain overall stable, despite fluctuations by other major currencies, and yuan-denominated assets could become safe havens for global capital. \"As recent top meetings stressed the need to stabilize economic growth, more policy measures will offer further support for the yuan's strengthening,\" Yang Delong, chief economist at Shenzhen-based First Seafront Fund, told the Global Times on Tuesday, noting that yuan-denominated assets will likely become more popular among global investors.A meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee on July 30, which focused on economic work for the second half of 2024, stressed the need to determinedly accomplish the economic and social development targets for the year, and pointed out that the implementation of macro policies should continue to be strengthened. Specifically, the meeting noted that the emphasis should be placed on boosting consumption to expand domestic demand.China has set a GDP growth target of about 5 percent for 2024, and many economists said that the country is on track to achieve the target, despite growing external downward pressure. China's steady economic recovery, compared with recessionary worries about the US economy, will also offer strong support for the yuan's exchange rate and the attractiveness of yuan-denominated assets, analysts said. \"On the one hand, as the likelihood of the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates grows, the attractiveness of the dollar will weaken, which in turn will ease the external depreciation pressure on the yuan. \"On the other hand, China's economy achieved a year-on-year growth rate of 5 percent in the first half of 2024, showing that China's economy still maintains stable growth momentum despite global uncertainties, providing support for the yuan's exchange rate,\" Cheng said.\n\nCopyright Global Times.

Title: Fujian Apex Software's Strong Fundamentals Drive Growth Potential Investors looking for a promising investment opportunity may want to consider Fujian Apex Software Co Ltd (FAS), a software development company based in China. Despite the lack of recent news, the company's strong fundamentals suggest that it could be poised for growth in the long term. According to data from Finanzen.net, the last known news about FAS dates back to August 29th, when the company presented its quarterly results. As of September 11th, the stock has maintained a steady closing price of 25.51 CNH, with a 52-week high of 55 CNH reached on September 26th, 2023, and a 52-week low of 23.25 CNH recorded on August 28th, 2024. These figures indicate a relatively stable performance over the past year, with a slight upward trend. One key metric that stands out for FAS is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 24.49, which suggests that the market is undervaluing the company's earning potential. This is supported by the company's strong financial health, with a Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 4, indicating that the company's assets are worth significantly more than its current market value. While there have been no recent developments or announcements regarding FAS, the company's solid track record and strong financials make it an attractive investment option for those seeking long-term growth. With a history of stability and a promising future ahead, FAS could be a valuable addition to any portfolio.\n\n- Cwb Automotive Electronics (605005.SS) traded up 0.81 % and now trades at CNY 15.21. Current market capitalisation for Cwb Automotive Electronics is CNY 6 bn. Cwb Automotive Electronics has a current price to earnings ratio of 23.27. Title: CWB Automotive Electronics: Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain a foothold in the booming automotive electronics market may want to take a closer look at CWB Automotive Electronics Co Ltd (CWEB), a Chinese firm that has been making waves with its innovative technology solutions. Despite a lack of recent news, a technical analysis of the company's performance paints a mixed picture of its potential. Current Price and Past Performance As of September 24th, 2024, CWEB's last closed price stood at 14.9 CNY, down from its 52-week high of 24.59 CNY recorded on November 28th, 2023. However, this decline has not deterred investors, as the stock has still seen significant growth over the past year, with a 52-week range of 11.3 CNY to 24.59 CNY. This volatility suggests that the company's future performance could be influenced by various factors, including changes in consumer demand and technological advancements. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio One key metric that investors often consider when evaluating CWEB's performance is its price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio). Currently standing at 23.27, this figure indicates that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its peers, suggesting that investors have high expectations for the company's future earnings growth. Additionally, CWEB's price to book ratio (P/B ratio) of 3.28221 implies that the stock is undervalued based on its assets, which could be an attractive opportunity for value investors. Technical Indicators When examining CWEB's chart patterns, several technical indicators provide insights into the company's short-term and long-term prospects. For instance, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 61.8%, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal remains bullish, with a positive crossover hinting at continued upward momentum. However, the Stochastic Oscillator reveals that the stock is approaching overbought territory, which could lead to a correction or consolidation period in the near future. Conclusion While CWEB's recent lack of news may raise concerns among investors, a technical analysis of the company's performance highlights both positive and negative signals. With a premium P/E ratio and undervalued P/B ratio, the stock appears to be attractively priced for those willing to take on some risk. However, the stock's volatility and approach to overbought territory suggest caution may be warranted before jumping into the fray. As such, investors should carefully weigh these factors before making any decisions regarding their investment strategy.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Shanghai Pudong Construction\n\nShanghai Pudong Construction Co.,Ltd offers infrastructure construction services.

The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 66.23 on 09/27/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 41.55 on 07/17/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic\n\nJiangsu Hengli Hydraulic Co Ltd: Technical Analysis As of September 16th, 2024, there have been no recent news updates for Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic Co Ltd. However, based on historical data, we can analyze the company's performance and outlook. Last Closing Price: 52.1 CNH The last closing price of Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic was 52.1 CNH on December 12th, 2023. This marks a decrease of 3.9% compared to November's performance, according to an article published by C WorldWide Emerging Markets on December 12th, 2023. 52 Weeks High/Low: 66.23 CNH / 41.55 CNH Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic reached its 52 weeks high of 66.23 CNH on September 26th, 2023, and its 52 weeks low of 41.55 CNH on July 16th, 2024. This indicates a significant fluctuation in the company's stock value over the past year. Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 27.82 Based on the company's latest financial report, the price to earnings ratio (P/E) stands at 27.82, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 27.82 times the company's earnings per share. Price to Book Ratio (P/B): 4.76 The price to book ratio (P/B) of Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic is currently 4.76, which suggests that the market values the company's assets at approximately 4.76 times their book value. From a technical standpoint, Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic's stock has experienced a downward trend since reaching its 52 weeks high in September 2023. The current price of 52.1 CNH represents a support level, and a break below this point could lead to further declines. On the other hand, a bounce back above the 52 weeks high could signal a potential reversal in the company's fortunes. In conclusion, while there have been no recent news updates for Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic Co Ltd, a technical analysis of the company's historical stock performance reveals a mixed picture. While the company's P/E and P/B ratios suggest undervaluation, the recent downward trend may indicate caution for potential investors. Further developments and future announcements will be crucial in determining the company's long-term prospects.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Air China (601111.SS) traded down -0.47 % and now trades at HKD 6.29. Current market capitalisation for Air China is HKD 92 bn. Title: Air China's Share Price Plummets Despite Lack of Recent News In a surprising turn of events, Air China's share price has been steadily declining over the past few months, despite the lack of any significant recent news or developments related to the company. As of yesterday's closing bell, the stock closed at 6.55 CNY, marking a substantial decrease from its 52-week high of 8.54 CNY reached on September 17th, 2023. Technical Analysis: A Closer Look From a technical standpoint, Air China's share price appears to be trending downwards, with a series of lower highs and lower lows forming a clear descending pattern. This suggests that the stock may be experiencing selling pressure, which could be attributed to various factors such as investor sentiment, market conditions, or potential changes in the company's fundamentals. Looking back at the stock's historical performance, we can see that Air China experienced a significant surge in share price during the second half of 2023, peaking at 8.54 CNY on September 17th. However, since then, the stock has been gradually losing momentum, falling below both its short-term and long-term moving averages. Currently, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at around 38, indicating that it is oversold but still showing signs of downward momentum. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is also pointing towards a bearish outlook, with the MACD line crossing below the signal line in recent days. Outlook and Potential Catalysts Despite the recent downturn, some analysts remain optimistic about Air China's prospects, citing the company's strong financials and solid track record of growth. Moreover, the upcoming Chinese National Day holiday period, which falls on October 1st this year, is typically a busy travel season, which could potentially boost demand for air travel and benefit Air China's bottom line. However, it is worth noting that the global economy remains uncertain, with ongoing geopolitical tensions and inflation concerns continuing to impact financial markets worldwide. Therefore, any negative surprises or unexpected developments could potentially exacerbate the downward pressure on Air China's share price. In conclusion, while there have been no recent major announcements from Air China, the company's share price continues to experience downward pressure, suggesting that investors may be cautious about the company's future prospects. Nevertheless, with a solid balance sheet and a proven track record of success, Air China remains an attractive option for risk-tolerant investors looking to capitalize on the long-term growth potential of the aviation industry.\n\n- China Southern Airlines (600029.SS) traded down -0.19 % and now trades at HKD 2.42. China Southern Airlines has a market capitalisation of HKD 85.4 bn. Title: China Southern Airlines' Efforts to Reduce Losses Paying Off? Investors may be keeping a close eye on China Southern Airlines Co Ltd (HKG:1055), as the airline continues to navigate through challenging times. Despite the lack of recent news, a look back at previous reports reveals some interesting trends that could impact the stock's performance. According to data from Airliners.de, the last reported news on China Southern Airlines dates back to August 30th, with the headline \"China Southern Airlines reduces losses.\" This suggests that the company has been taking steps to mitigate its financial struggles, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking at the stock's historical pricing, we can see that the last closing price was 5.27 HKD, representing a significant drop from its 52-week high of 6.38 HKD on November 26th, 2023. However, the stock has remained relatively stable over the past month, with minimal fluctuations. One key metric that investors may want to focus on is the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) of -18.39, indicating that the stock is trading at a discount compared to its peers. Additionally, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) of 1.16 suggests that the stock is undervalued based on its assets. While there is no guarantee that China Southern Airlines will continue to reduce its losses or maintain its current valuation, these metrics suggest that the company may be poised for growth in the long term. However, investors should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Goneo (603195.SS) traded up 1.72 % and now trades at CNH 64.98. Goneo has a market capitalisation of CNH 81.1 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Goneo is 18.81. Title: Goneo's Strong Fundamentals and Technical Indicators Point to Continued Growth Investors looking for a strong and stable investment opportunity may want to consider Goneo Group Co Ltd (GONEO), a leading provider of innovative solutions for various industries. Despite the lack of recent news, the company's fundamentals and technical indicators paint a picture of continued growth and potential gains. Strong Financials According to the latest available data, Goneo's last closing price was 64.56 CNH, representing a 52-week high of 120.89 CNH at 2024-04-29 22:00:00 and a 52-week low of 61.01 CNH at 2024-09-10 22:00:00. The price to earnings ratio stands at 18.81, while the price to book ratio is 5.9. These figures indicate a healthy and profitable business with a strong balance sheet. Technical Analysis From a technical perspective, Goneo's stock has been trending upwards over the past year, with a few minor setbacks. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 57.67, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral position. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line is above the signal line, indicating a bullish signal. Additionally, the stock's Bollinger Bands are contracting, which can be an indication of increased volatility and potentially higher prices in the near future. Outlook Based on these technical and fundamental indicators, it appears that Goneo is well-positioned for continued growth and success. While there may be some short-term fluctuations, the long-term outlook remains positive. Investors considering adding Goneo to their portfolios should do so with confidence, knowing that the company's strong financials and solid track record make it a reliable choice for those seeking steady returns.\n\n- China Railway Construction (601186.SS) traded up 1.76 % and now trades at HKD 4.42.

Despite a lack of recent news, CRCC's strong fundamentals and impressive track record have analysts optimistic about the company's future prospects. As of yesterday's market close, CRCC's stock closed at 6.83 CNY, up from its 52-week low of 6.83 CNY on September 12th. This marks a significant recovery for the company, which saw its share price plummet to a 52-week low earlier this year. Looking back at CRCC's performance over the past year, the company has made remarkable progress in driving forward the modernization of China's railways. According to an EQS-News report from April 24th, CRCC has been making \"bahnbrechende fortschritte\" or groundbreaking advancements towards achieving this goal. From a technical perspective, CRCC's stock appears to be trending upwards, with its 52-week high reaching 9.29 CNY on January 28th. However, the company's price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) of 4.36674 and price to book ratio (P/B Ratio) of 0.292956 suggest that the stock may still be undervalued compared to its peers. In light of these developments, investors may want to keep a close eye on CRCC as the company continues to drive growth and innovation in China's railway sector. With a solid balance sheet and a proven track record of success, CRCC could be poised for long-term success in the years ahead.\n\n- Shanghai Airport (600009.SS) traded up 2.15 % and now trades at CNH 31.22.

Trump has vowed to make the\nUnited States \"the crypto capital of the planet\". \n    \"It's still an extension of the post-election moves; the\neconomic calendar has been relatively light although it's\npicking up later in the week but for now the market is focusing\non the implications of a second Trump term, particularly\npolicies that would be positive for the dollar such as potential\nhigher tariffs,\" said Vassili Serebriakov, an FX strategist at\nUBS in New York.\n        Higher tariffs are expected to push up prices, leaving\nthe Federal Reserve less scope to cut interest rates.\n  \n    The U.S. dollar index <=USD>, which measures the currency\nagainst six peers rose 0.53% to 105.98, hitting its highest\nlevel since early July.\n    Trump's Republican Party will hold a slim majority in both\nhouses of Congress, allowing the president-elect to push his\nagenda cutting taxes and regulation after he takes office in\nJanuary.\n    \"There's been a broad move in the dollar that started before\nthe election and it probably got an added boost because it looks\nlike we're moving to a red sweep scenario, which is broadly seen\nas positive for the dollar,\" Serebriakov added.\n    Trump has warned that the euro bloc will \"pay a big price\"\nfor not buying enough American exports, with cars a particular\ntarget. He has threatened China with blanket 60% tariffs.\n    Since his election last week, the euro has languished at a\nseven-month trough and the yuan slumped to its lowest in more\nthan three months, with Europe and China both targets of\npotential Trump tariffs.\n    The euro is feeling additional pressure from political\nuncertainty in Germany, the bloc's biggest economy. Germany is\nset to hold fresh elections on Feb. 23, which will be eleven\nweeks after the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's governing\ncoalition.\n    The euro <EUR=EBS> sank to $1.06065 on Tuesday, the lowest\nsince mid-April, and was last down 0.41% at $1.061.\n        \n    Sterling <GBP=D3> dropped 0.61% to $1.2791 after data showed\nregular UK wage growth slowed and unemployment rose, with the\npound also feeling the heat from the dollar's rally.\n    Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose 0.46% to 154.41\nyen <JPY=EBS>.

Title: Technical Analysis: Hubei Jianghan New Materials' Mixed Quarterly Results Investors looking for a stable and profitable investment may want to take a closer look at Hubei Jianghan New Materials Co Ltd (HJM), a Chinese company specializing in the production of new materials. Despite mixed quarterly results, the company's fundamentals suggest a promising future ahead. Recent News and Performance According to the latest news available, HJM announced its quarterly earnings on November 2nd, with a revenue of $1.2 billion, representing a 10% increase compared to the same period last year. However, the company's net profit fell by 28% due to rising raw material costs and increased competition. As of November 17th, the stock closed at 25.52 CNH, down by 4.4% from its previous close. Past Performance and Key Metrics HJM has had a rollercoaster ride over the past year, with its stock price fluctuating between 19.71 CNH (52 weeks low) and 29.9 CNH (52 weeks high). The stock currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 16.57 and a price-to-book ratio (P/B) of 1.99. These ratios indicate that the market expects HJM's earnings to grow at a faster rate than its book value. Technical Outlook From a technical standpoint, HJM's stock appears to be consolidating after a strong upward move earlier this year. The relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 50.66, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator suggests a bullish crossover, which could trigger a potential buying opportunity. Key Risks and Considerations Despite its promising fundamentals, HJM faces several risks and challenges. The ongoing global economic uncertainty and trade tensions could negatively impact the company's exports and profitability. Additionally, the highly competitive nature of the industry means that HJM must continue to innovate and differentiate itself to maintain market share. Conclusion While HJM's mixed quarterly results may have caused some investor hesitation, our technical analysis suggests that the stock may be poised for a rebound. With a solid track record of growth and a favorable outlook, investors considering a long-term position in HJM may find this an attractive entry point. However, it is essential to closely monitor geopolitical developments and industry trends to ensure that the risk-reward profile remains balanced.\n\n- Fujian Expressway Development (600033.SS) traded down -0.84 % and now trades at CNY 3.55.

The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 14.35 on 09/03/2024. 52 weeks low was at CNY 8.31 on 11/08/2023.\n\nSummary of the latest news for China Coal Energy\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: China Coal Energy's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain exposure to the Chinese energy sector may want to take a closer look at China Coal Energy Co Ltd (OTCMKTS: CCOZY), which has been experiencing a mix of positive and negative signals in recent months. Despite posting strong earnings results, the stock has struggled to maintain momentum, leaving analysts divided on its future prospects. Earnings Performance According to the latest report from American Banking News, China Coal Energy posted impressive earnings results on August 28th, with a profit of $0.16 per share, beating expectations by $0.03. This marks the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for the company, indicating a steady increase in demand for its coal products. Price Action However, despite these promising earnings, the stock has failed to sustain any significant gains. As of September 22nd, the last closing price was $12.93, down from its 52-week high of $14.35 on September 2nd. This drop can be attributed to investor hesitation due to the uncertain global economic environment and fluctuating commodity prices. Technical Indicators From a technical standpoint, China Coal Energy's performance appears to be mixed. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 52.67, suggesting that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator indicates a bearish crossover, hinting at a potential downward trend. Key Resistance and Support Levels Key resistance levels for China Coal Energy include $14.35 (52-week high), $13.50 (200-day moving average), and $12.50 (support level). Key support levels include $11.50 (200-day moving average), $10.50 (support level), and $9.50 (2019 low). Conclusion While China Coal Energy's earnings results suggest a healthy business, the stock's inability to maintain upward momentum raises concerns among investors. From a technical perspective, the MACD indicator suggests a potential downward trend, while the RSI remains neutral. Therefore, investors may want to approach this stock with caution, waiting for clearer signs of direction before making any investment decisions.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Cmoc (603993.SS) traded up 3.92 % and now trades at CNY 6.83.

This impressive performance is a testament to the company's resilience and adaptability in an ever-changing market. As of the last closing price of 7.44 HKD, Cmoc has seen significant growth over the past year, with its 52-week high reaching 9.87 HKD on April 21st, 2024. This represents a substantial increase of 27.6% from its previous 52-week high. Additionally, the stock has experienced a low of 4.12 HKD on February 14th, 2024, representing a gain of 83.7% since then. From a technical standpoint, Cmoc appears to be trending upwards, with strong support at around 7.44 HKD, the current closing price.

The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) line is currently at 8.47, which is above the signal line, indicating a bullish crossover. These indicators suggest that the uptrend may continue in the short term. Key Statistics: * Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 9.35 * Price to Book Ratio (P/B): 1.93 * 52-Week High: 9.87 HKD (April 21st, 2024) * 52-Week Low: 4.12 HKD (February 14th, 2024) Conclusion: CMOC Group Ltd has demonstrated remarkable resilience and adaptability in the face of an ever-changing market, resulting in a staggering 670% rise in net profit for the first half of 2024.

From a technical standpoint, Fuyao Glass Industry's current price of 46.9 HKD represents a moderate increase compared to its 52-week low. However, the stock's price to earnings ratio (P/E) of 17.27 and price to book ratio (P/B) of 3.43 suggest that it may be slightly overvalued based on its earnings and book value. Despite this, analysts remain optimistic about the company's future prospects. In their latest report, they noted that Fuyao Glass Industry has been expanding its product offerings and increasing its market share in the domestic Chinese market. Additionally, the company's strong financial position, with a low debt-to-equity ratio and ample cash reserves, bodes well for its long-term growth potential. Given these factors, investors may want to keep an eye on Fuyao Glass Industry as a potentially attractive investment opportunity. However, it is important to continue monitoring the company's performance and industry trends before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Crrc (1766.HK) traded up 3.49 % and now trades at HKD 4.86.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently sitting at 48.17, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is showing a bullish crossover, suggesting that the upward trend may continue. In terms of valuation, CRRC's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 9.53, which is slightly above the industry average. Meanwhile, the Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio is 0.74916, indicating that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers.

Seres has a market capitalisation of CNY 118 bn. Seres has a current price to earnings ratio of 229.1. Title: SERES Group Co Ltd: Technical Analysis Reveals Upswing Potential Investors may be eyeing SERES Group Co Ltd (SEHK:2408) with renewed interest, given the company's recent expansion into European markets and strong historical performance. As of September 11th, 2024, the stock closed at 75.91 CNH, just shy of its 52-week high of 106.66 CNH reached on March 17th, 2024. This marks a significant recovery from the 52-week low of 41.6 CNH seen on September 13th, 2023. A closer look at the company's financial ratios paints an even more promising picture. With a Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 224.26, investors can expect substantial growth potential compared to industry peers. Additionally, the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) stands at 8.76, indicating undervaluation based on the company's net assets. These figures suggest that SERES may be poised for long-term success and potentially offer attractive entry points for savvy investors. While there have been no recent news updates on the company, the successful launch of their new energy vehicle product, SERES 5, in Europe bodes well for future sales and revenue growth. Furthermore, the first batch of user deliveries took place on June 21st, 2023, in Norway, highlighting the company's commitment to expanding its global presence. Given these positive developments and the company's solid financials, it may be worth considering SERES Group Co Ltd as a viable investment opportunity.

Current market capitalisation for China Everbright Bank is HKD 144.2 bn. China Everbright Bank has a current price to earnings ratio of 3.51. Hong Kong's China Everbright Bank Sees Steady Growth Despite Recent Lull in Trading Activity Despite a lack of recent news, Hong Kong's China Everbright Bank has maintained steady growth in the past year, with its shares trading at around 2.33 Hong Kong dollars (HKD) as of September 2nd, according to Finanzen.net. This represents a modest increase from the 52-week low of 2.13 HKD recorded on January 21st, but a slight decrease from the 52-week high of 2.64 HKD reached on May 19th. Technical Analysis Indicates Mixed Signals From a technical standpoint, the stock's price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) stands at 3.39, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately three times the company's earnings per share for each dollar of net income. Meanwhile, the price to book ratio (P/B Ratio) is 0.29892, suggesting that the market values the company's assets at roughly 30% above their book value. These ratios suggest mixed signals about the company's future performance. On one hand, the P/E Ratio indicates that investors have high expectations for the company's earnings growth, while the P/B Ratio suggests that the market may be overvaluing the company's assets. However, without more recent news or developments, it is difficult to accurately assess the company's prospects. In conclusion, while there have been no significant updates on China Everbright Bank in recent days, the company's steady growth and stable financial fundamentals suggest that it remains a solid long-term investment opportunity. Nevertheless, investors should continue to monitor the company's progress and any changes in the broader economic landscape before making any investment decisions.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout China Coal Energy\n\nChina Coal Energy Co Ltd. is a mining and processing company that specializes in producing thermal and coking coal products.

The CNH also pointed out that the total resources that could be incorporated in the base scenario are 8.8 million barrels of crude oil equivalent, while adding those of the incremental scenario could reach 42.6 million barrels.The commissioning president, Agustín Díaz Lastra, said that what is approved is an extension of time for PEP to do the work and in due course the details of the corresponding drilling will be seen.Pemex in Tabasco:#ConocePemex en #1minuto With these activities, in the Cheek field we are increasing approximately one thousand barrels more than what we had committed to.

This upward trend suggests that the company may be poised for future growth, especially considering its strong fundamentals. One key metric that highlights BMSSF's financial health is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 10.15, indicating that the stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. Additionally, the company's Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 0.6186 suggests that it is trading at a discount relative to its assets. In terms of technical analysis, BMSSF's chart pattern indicates a bullish outlook. The stock has been steadily increasing since April 21st, 2024, when it reached its 52-week high of 7.48 CNH. Although it has pulled back slightly since then, the uptrend remains intact, with the stock maintaining above its short-term moving averages.

However, a review of the company's historical financials provides some interesting insights. According to data from finanzen.net, the last known news about Bank of Jiangsu dates back to August 18th, with the stock closing at 7.53 CNY. While there has been no recent news, investors can still gain valuable insights from the company's quarterly results. Looking at the company's 52-week high and low, we see that Bank of Jiangsu reached a peak of 8.45 CNY on May 21st, 2024, before falling to a low of 6.36 CNY on December 5th, 2023.

While these ratios provide useful context, they do not tell the whole story.

Title: China Everbright Bank's Recent Performance Holds Promise Investors may be keeping a close eye on China Everbright Bank (CEBK) as the company has shown promising performance in recent months. Despite a lack of recent news, CEBK's historical data provides valuable insights into the company's growth potential. As of September 21st, 2024, CEBK's last closed price stood at $2.31, representing a modest increase from its 52-week low of $2.13 recorded on January 21st, 2024. However, the stock has yet to reach its 52-week high of $2.64, which was achieved on May 19th, 2024. This suggests that while the company has made progress, there may still be room for growth. One key metric that investors may find particularly interesting is CEBK's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, currently standing at 3.34. This indicates that the market is valuing each dollar of the company's earnings at approximately three dollars and thirty-four cents. While this may seem relatively high, it is important to note that CEBK's earnings have been steadily increasing over time, suggesting that the company's financial health is strong. Another metric worth considering is CEBK's price-to-book (P/B) ratio, which stands at 0.293665. This indicates that the market values the company's assets at approximately twenty-nine percent of its book value. Again, while this may seem low compared to other companies in the industry, it is important to remember that CEBK has been consistently profitable and has demonstrated steady growth. Overall, while there may not be any immediate news driving CEBK's stock price, the company's historical performance and fundamental metrics suggest that it could be a promising long-term investment opportunity. As such, investors may want to keep a watchful eye on CEBK's future developments and consider adding it to their portfolios if they haven't already done so.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout China Three Gorges Renewables\n\nChina Three Gorges Renewables Group Co.,Ltd. is a utility company operating in the renewable energy generation sector.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Daily Market Outlook - Wednesday, Nov. 6Nov 06, 2024\n\nImage Source: Pixabay  \n\nThe results of the US presidential election indicate that Trump will emerge victorious and the Republican Party will maintain control of the Senate. The New York Times' closely-watched 'swingometer' projected a 93% chance of Trump winning, while Treasury yields rose to four-month highs as some betting sites significantly favoured him. However, the House of Representatives is still too close to call. Four years after departing the White House, Trump has advanced to the brink of a remarkable political revival by defeating Democrat Kamala Harris in the battleground states of North Carolina, Georgia & Pennsylvania. The euro, yen, and antipodean currencies have experienced declines as a result of the 1.5% increase in the US dollar index, which is the largest increase since March 2020. The dollar's sharp increase against the offshore yuan prompted reports that Chinese banks were selling dollars to slow the yuan's decline. China is perceived as being at the forefront of tariff risk, and its currency is currently trading at a high level of uncertainty, with implied volatility against the dollar circling record highs. As investors anticipate a meeting of top policymakers in Beijing this week to sanction local government debt refinancing and spending, Chinese markets have declined from an almost one-month high.\n\nEuropean stock futures were less ebullient due to the potential for a global trade war and the threat to EU exports if Trump's tariff policies are implemented. Additionally, there was a possibility that Trump could disengage from NATO, which would necessitate an increase in defence expenditures in Europe and would also serve to strengthen Russia's territorial ambitions. Aside from US political developments, macro events that could potentially impact markets on Wednesday include: Services within the Eurozone Producer prices for September and PMIs for October. September industrial orders in Germany. Services provided by the United States PMI for October.  \n\nOvernight Newswire Updates of Note\n\n * Trump Wins The Critical Battleground State Of Pennsylvania \n * PBoC Affirms Supportive Monetary Policy\n * Japan PM Ishiba Preps Meeting With Biden, China’s XI\n * Japan PMI, Confidence Shrinks On Softer Sales\n * UBS Pushes Back RBA First Rate Cut Forecast To May 2025\n * NZ Unemployment Rate Rises Less Than Forecast\n * Hong Kong Stocks Slide, Traders Pare Risky Bets\n * US Stock, Yields Rise As Markets Await Election Outcome\n * Nvidia Rides AI Wave Past Apple As World largest Company\n * Crypto Surge To Record Levels On Early Trump Lead\n * Spike In UK Borrowing Cost Wipes Out Fiscal Headroom\n *           (Sourced from reliable financial news outlets)\n\n \n\nFX Options Expiries For 10am New York Cut \n\n(1BLN+ represents larger expiries, more magnetic when trading within daily ATR)\n\n * EUR/USD: 1.0650 (3.9BLN), 1.0700 (686M), 1.0725 (1.5BLN)\n * 1.0750 (900M) 1.0800 (2.4BLN)\n * USD/CHF: 0.8675 (241M), 0.8700 (1.4BLN), 0.8800 (289M)\n * EUR/GBP: 0.8390-0.8400 (621M)\n * GBP/USD: 1.3000 (331M)\n * AUD/USD: 0.6475 (689M), 0.6510 (728M), 0.6525 (817M)\n * AUD/NZD: 1.1010 (397M), 1.1100 (300M)\n * USD/CAD: 1.3800 (555M), 1.3875 (420M), 1.4025 (267M), 1.4050 (442M)\n * USD/JPY: 153.50 (728M), 155.65 (350M)  \n\nCFTC Data As Of 1/11/24\n\n * Net USD G10 long +$8.88bn to +$18.7bn in Oct 23-29 IMM period; $IDX +0.13%\n * EUR +0.17%: speculative positions decreased by 21.8k contracts, now at -50.3k, lower ECB view weighs on EUR\n * JPY +1.55%; speculative positions decreased by 37.6k contracts, now at +25k, on hawkish Fed, less dovish BoJ\n * GBP +0.27%; speculative positions decreased by 8.2k contracts, now at +66.4k; less-dovish BoE lends support.

Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Phenix Optical\n\nPhenix Optical Co., Ltd. is a Chinese company that specializes in manufacturing and marketing a wide range of optical and photographic products.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "EUR/USD Extends Recovery But Don't Expect It To Last - Here's WhyNov 26, 2024\n\nImage Source: Pixabay  \n\nThe euro rebounded after an initial drop, as Trump made no immediate tariff threats against eurozone exports. While his warnings appear to be negotiation tactics ahead of his January 20 inauguration, markets remain highly reactive to headlines, creating volatile trading conditions. Despite appointing Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary, Trump’s potential use of executive orders underscores his direct leadership style. The brief cooling of the \"Trump Trade,\" characterised by a strong dollar and Bitcoin rally, may not last. For now, the euro is gaining short-term relief, though the EUR/USD forecast remains modestly bearish.  \n\nOutlook far from ideal for euro\n\nOvernight we saw a big shake up in the FX space as currencies of Mexico, Canada, and China all came under pressure. Only one man could cause such a stir, and it was no other than President-elect Donald Trump, who threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada unless they step up border security against illegal immigration, and to curb Fentanyl inflows from China. Relieved that there were no immediate mentions against eurozone exports, the euro managed to bounce back after a quick drop. While this move appears to be a negotiation tactic from Trump ahead of his January 20 inauguration, the market will increasingly become headline-driven and make for tricky trading conditions. Still, despite appointing a perceived safe pair of hands in Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary, one should not take lightly Trump’s verbal warnings as he could use executive orders to pass them through law. Indeed, if you recall from my note on Monday, I warned that Trump will be the ultimate boss and will lead from the front. And overnight he did really remind us who the boss was. Therefore, the slight cooling of the so-called \"Trump Trade,\" i.e., with a strong dollar cooling as we have seen thus far in the week (except against CAD and CNH that were hit by Trump’s tariff threat overnight), may not last long. But today, the euro is finding itself on the front foot amid the relief bounce that commenced from end of last week from severely technical oversold levels. While the recovery may end up lasting for a while, the EUR/USD outlook remains modestly bearish.  \n\nEuro rebound could be short-lived \n\nThis week, we haven’t got much in the way of Eurozone date. On Monday, the German Ifo Business Climate survey offered new insights into business sentiment. Following last week’s weak PMI data, a positive surprise seemed unlikely, and the results confirmed this. The survey came in at 85.7, below both the previous 86.5 and expectations of 86.1.\n\nThe euro’s recent struggles underscore investor concerns about the economic outlook in the Eurozone and China, as well as trade uncertainties in 2025 following Trump’s US election victory.\n\nTraders are closely monitoring eurozone data for improvement, but without positive signs, the euro may remain under pressure despite a strong start to the week. Last week’s composite PMI fell from 50 to 48.1, indicating contraction, with both services and manufacturing slowing. Weak export demand and declining business sentiment add to the gloom. While third-quarter GDP showed growth, fourth-quarter stagnation now appears likely, reinforcing a bearish euro sentiment.  \n\nWhat about US dollar and data? \n\nWhile it may have lost some momentum, the dollar has been on a strong bullish trend until the start of this week. But it is by no means it is the end of the bullish trend. Traders have been betting on Trump’s fiscal policies, including sweeping trade tariffs and measures to boost economic growth. The dollar index had risen for eight straight weeks through Friday. The momentum is thus quite strong and so this dollar weakness may prove to be short-lived, preventing the EUR/USD from turning bullish just yet.\n\nThis is a shortened week due to Thanksgiving. Today’s data highlights on the US economic calendar include CB Consumer Confidence (expected to show an improvement to 111.8 from 108.7 last), New Home Sales, Richmond Manufacturing Index and FOMC minutes. On Wednesday, ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, the US will release a flurry of data, including the second estimate of Q3 GDP, core PCE inflation, unemployment claims and durable goods orders.\n\nThese reports could significantly influence the short-term EUR/USD direction, but it may not have any long-term impact as everyone is focused on what Trump will mean for the dollar next year. With many investors likely stepping away for the long holiday weekend, Friday could be a quieter day.    \n\nEUR/USD technical analysis and key levels to watch\n\nSource: TradingView.com\n\nThe fact that the EUR/USD has so far refused to hold below last year’s low of 1.0448 is a modestly positive sign, if it can hang around these levels. But the series of lower lows and lower highs should remind you that we that we have seen such recovery attempts only to be engulfed frequently by even sharper sell-off periods. Thus, without a solid technical evidence that rates have bottomed out, we could be in another such environment: corrective phase inside a larger bear trend. The EUR/USD is therefore far from bullish from a purely technical point of view, just yet.\n\nIf the EUR/USD manages to build a base now around the 1.0450-1.0500 area (shaded in grey on the chart), then we may see it climb back towards the next resistance at 1.0600, and even higher towards the more significant hurdle around 1.0700 area. But if it goes back below that 1.0450-1.0500 area, then for me that would be the clearest indication yet that traders want to see even lower levels such as 1.0300, 1.0200 and so on.\n\nMore By This Author:\n\nGold Drops On Bessent Appointment But Bears Face Lots Of Hurdles S&P 500 At Pivotal Zone EUR/USD Under Pressure From Multiple Sources But Clings On To $1.05 For Now"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

On Friday, it looked set for its\nfifth straight weekly gain, the longest winning streak in more\nthan three years.\n    While none of the underlying drivers at home, namely a weak\neconomy and capital flight, has changed, the yuan has been\nhelped by growing bets for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts,\nwhich are weakening the dollar, and by a rally in the Japanese\nyen.\n    Meanwhile, Chinese authorities have worked behind the scenes\nto ensure the currency doesn't spike abruptly, which could roil\nfragile domestic financial markets and hurt exporters. They have\nsurveyed the market to gauge the pressure, and quietly relaxed\nrestrictions on imports of gold and trading positions in the\nyuan for some banks.\n    \"The government is probably less concerned about\ndepreciation but remains wary of FX volatility,\" said Gary Ng,\nsenior economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis.\n    \"While the pressure on the yuan may ease as the Fed may\nfinally cut interest rates, there may be sudden and significant\nmovements in capital flows.\"\n        One big reason for the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to\nbe worried is the build-up of speculative short yuan positions\nduring the currency's steady decline since early 2023, which\ncould be unwound messily if the currency rises fast. \n        Foreign companies operating in China, domestic exporters\nand  investors have swapped yuan for dollars to earn better\nreturns in what is known in market circles as the yuan carry\ntrade.  \n        Analysts at the Macquarie Group estimate exporters and\nmultinational companies have accumulated foreign currency\nholdings of more than $500 billion since 2022.\n    \"As the yuan appreciates... concerns about the potential\nunwinding of yuan carry trade and shocks to financial markets\nmay arise,\" said Zhu Chaoping, global market strategist at J.P.\nMorgan Asset Management.\n    \"Recent market volatility in Japan might have reminded\npolicymakers about these risks.\"\n    China's currency regulator, the State Administration of\nForeign Exchange (SAFE), and the PBOC did not immediately\nrespond to Reuters requests for comment.\n        \n  \n    \n    PREVENT A STAMPEDE\n        Possibly to get an idea of pent-up yuan buying that\ncould come as the currency appreciates, SAFE surveyed banks\nabout their clients' FX conversion ratio - the proportion of\nrevenues exporters convert into yuan - last week, two people\nwith direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n    \"FX settlement is the issue that everyone in the market is\nmostly concerned about, besides the Fed rate cut,\" said Liu\nYang, general manager of the financial market business\ndepartment at minerals exporter Zheshang Development Group.\n    \"After all, exports are the only major driver of China's\neconomy among its traditional 'troika' (traditional growth\nengines), and regulators do not want the yuan to appreciate\nrapidly and substantially to weaken the competitiveness of\nexport products,\" he said.\n        Separately, guidance given to banks last year banning\nthem from keeping short yuan positions at the end of a day's\ntrading has also been relaxed for some banks, two people with\ndirect knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n    Chinese banks have also been given new gold import quotas by\nthe central bank, Reuters reported. Gold imports are usually\ncurtailed when the yuan faces depreciation pressures.\n    The measures are subtle, analysts said, and together with\nthe trend in the PBOC's daily benchmark guidance setting for the\nyuan, simply point to a desire to contain volatility, rather\nthan thwart gains.\n    Still, market participants are revising their yuan\nforecasts. \n    Analysts at BofA Securities expect the yuan will continue to\nweaken, \"given subdued growth and PBOC's easing bias\", but see\nthe yuan at 7.38 per dollar by year-end, not 7.45 as they had\npreviously forecast. It is currently around 7.14 per dollar.    \n\n        \n  \n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nChina's dollar hoard vs yuan    https://tmsnrt.rs/4cC2ixy\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom\nEditing by Vidya Ranganathan and Kim Coghill)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

Those losses were reversed within minutes following a\nmarkedly stronger yuan benchmark. \n    The People's Bank of China fixed USD/CNY at 7.0996, mere pips below Friday's\n7.1004, but the impact was magnified by its massive -1300 pips deviation from\nneutral forecasts, the biggest since November. It implies a 1.8% adjustment for\na stronger yuan than the market expected.\n    Currency depreciation is not a panacea for China's economic troubles, but it\ncould be a salve for exporters, especially as the Japanese yen weakens. \n    Clearly, stability is still a bigger priority for Beijing, given the risks\nof further unnerving foreign investors. Chinese stocks tumbled Friday as yuan\ndevaluation fears swirled.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "SHANGHAI, September 20 (SMM) -\n\nCopper\n\nLME copper opened at $9,543.5/mt overnight. After a slight initial fluctuation, it peaked at $9,572.5/mt and then declined to a low of $9,477/mt. It later rebounded slightly and closed at $9,539/mt, up 1.48%. The trading volume was 28,000 lots, and open interest was 271,000 lots. The most-traded SHFE copper 2410 contract opened at 75,910 yuan/mt, peaked at 76,000 yuan/mt initially, then declined to a low of 75,430 yuan/mt, and finally consolidated to close at 75,660 yuan/mt, up 1.03%. The trading volume was 36,000 lots, and open interest was 136,000 lots. Macro-wise, following the long-anticipated US Fed rate cut, the US dollar index declined. Additionally, data released by the US Department of Labor on Thursday showed that initial jobless claims unexpectedly recorded 219,000 last week, the lowest since the week of May 18, 2024, reducing recession expectations and boosting copper prices. On the fundamentals, after the most-traded contract shifted to 2410, downstream restocking enthusiasm was high, with overall demand relatively strong. However, supply was tight in some regions, causing downstream concerns about future arrivals. As of Thursday, September 19, SMM copper inventory in major regions stood at 192,600 mt, down 24,300 mt WoW, marking the 11th consecutive week of destocking, with destocking accelerating. The inventory hit a new post-Chinese New Year low. Overall, copper prices are expected to fluctuate at highs today.\n\nAluminum\n\nFutures market: The most-traded SHFE aluminum 2411 contract opened at 20,105 yuan/mt overnight, reaching a high of 20,135 yuan/mt and a low of 20,040 yuan/mt, and closed at 20,080 yuan/mt, up 120 yuan/mt or 0.6%. Yesterday, LME aluminum opened at $2,521.5/mt, hit a high of $2,569/mt and a low of $2,506/mt, and closed at $2,540/mt, up $18/mt or 0.71%.\n\nSummary: On the macro front, the US Fed's rate cut was implemented as expected, with the cut slightly exceeding market expectations, causing overseas metals to jump initially and then pull back. Domestically, the market is widely focused on the new round of LPR adjustments, with macro sentiment improving and benefiting the metals market. Fundamentals side, domestic aluminum market supply slightly increased, supported by the September-October peak season, with downstream consumption remaining positive. Aluminum social inventory entered a destocking cycle, showing good performance in the supply-demand balance for aluminum in September and October. Additionally, disruptions in the alumina supply and tight spot supply continued to support alumina prices to fluctuate upward, providing some drive from the cost side for aluminum. Overall, with the short-term favourable macro atmosphere and solid fundamentals, the aluminum market is expected to fluctuate upward in the short term.\n\nLead\n\nOvernight, LME lead opened at $2,032.5/mt, briefly touched a low of $2,022/mt during the Asian session, and then rebounded. Due to a weaker US dollar index, shorts reduced their positions during the European session, causing LME lead to fluctuate upward, reaching a high of $2,090.5/mt, and finally closing at $2,082.5/mt, up 2.49%.\n\nOvernight, the most-traded SHFE lead 2410 contract opened at 16,610 yuan/mt, briefly touched a low of 16,560 yuan/mt at the beginning of the session, and then rebounded, boosted by LME lead, reaching a high of 16,705 yuan/mt. It then fluctuated around 16,660 yuan/mt and closed at 16,675 yuan/mt, up 1.65%.\n\nMacro-wise, the initial jobless claims in the US for the week ending September 14 recorded 219,000, the lowest since the week ending May 18, 2024. The offshore yuan rose to around 7.06 against the US dollar.\n\nOn the spot fundamentals, the first working day after the Mid-Autumn Festival saw the delivery of the SHFE lead 2409 contract. Due to the delivery factors of holders, the arrival of lead ingots in social warehouses increased during the holiday, pushing the overall inventory level to a one-month high. Meanwhile, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, many lead smelters continued production as usual, while downstream enterprises generally took 1-2 days off, leading to a temporary lack of lead consumption and a continuous rise in lead ingot inventory. Additionally, the recent simultaneous decline in supply and demand for lead ingots resulted in a sluggish spot market. For the future trend of lead prices, attention should be paid to the extent of downstream stocking before the National Day holiday.\n\nZinc\n\nOvernight, LME zinc opened at $2,880/mt. At the beginning of the session, short positions increased, pushing LME zinc down to $2,848/mt. Subsequently, long positions entered at the lows, driving LME zinc to fluctuate upward, with the focus shifting to around $2,930/mt during European trading hours. During this period, it reached a high of $2,945/mt. Entering the night session, LME zinc briefly fell but was supported by the daily moving average. By the end of the session, the focus returned to around $2,930/mt, and it finally closed at $2,939.5/mt, an increase of $55.5/mt or 1.92%. Trading volume decreased to 11,574 lots, and open interest increased by 978 lots to 243,000 lots. Overnight, LME zinc recorded a large bullish candlestick, with the 10/20-day moving averages providing support. Overnight, LME inventory increased by 4,950 mt to 256,800 mt, an increase of 1.97%. LME inventory continued to rise. The US Fed's rate cut overnight led to a broad rise in non-ferrous metals, with LME zinc fluctuating at highs.\n\nOvernight, the most-traded SHFE zinc 2411 contract opened at 24,100 yuan/mt. At the beginning of the session, short positions increased, pushing SHFE zinc down along the daily moving average, with the focus shifting to 23,890 yuan/mt. Subsequently, long positions entered and short positions closed, pushing SHFE zinc back to the daily moving average. It finally closed at 23,925 yuan/mt, an increase of 150 yuan/mt or 0.63%. Trading volume decreased to 45,221 lots, and open interest increased by 648 lots to 95,752 lots. Overnight, SHFE zinc recorded a bearish candlestick with no upper shadow, with various moving averages providing support. Overnight, driven by the overseas market, SHFE zinc fluctuated at highs. Coupled with positive domestic policy expectations, market sentiment improved. However, the current price has reached a resistance level, and further upward movement requires additional stimulus.\n\nTin\n\nIn the night session yesterday, the most-traded SHFE tin contract closed at 259,080 yuan/mt, up 2,930 yuan/mt, an increase of 1.14%. The highest price was 260,280 yuan/mt, and the lowest was 257,900 yuan/mt.\n\nDuring the morning session yesterday, trading companies' quotes for various domestic tin ingot brands showed little change compared to recent days. Small brand tin ingots were quoted at premiums of 0-500 yuan/mt against SHFE 2410 contract, delivery brand tin ingots were quoted at premiums of 200-700 yuan/mt against SHFE 2410 contract, and Yunnan Tin brand was quoted at premiums of 200-800 yuan/mt against SHFE 2410 contract. Imported tin brands were quoted at discounts of 700-200 yuan/mt against SHFE 2410 contract. The sharp rise in tin prices during the morning session yesterday dampened the purchasing enthusiasm of downstream and end-user companies, with only a few downstream companies restocking as needed. Most trading companies saw scattered transactions. Overall, the spot market transactions were relatively sluggish yesterday.\n\nNickel\n\nOn September 19, Jinchuan nickel was quoted at a premium of 1,800-2,000 yuan/mt, with an average of 1,900 yuan/mt, up 50 yuan/mt compared to the previous trading day. Norilsk nickel was quoted at a discount of 200-100 yuan/mt, with an average of 150 yuan/mt, up 25 yuan/mt compared to the previous trading day. On the morning of September 18, the futures market fluctuated upward, and the spot premium narrowed overall compared to the previous working day. The price of nickel briquette was 121,850-122,950 yuan/mt, up 375 yuan/mt compared to the previous trading day. The price spread between nickel briquette and nickel sulphate was about 4,509 yuan/mt (nickel sulphate prices were 4,509 yuan/mt higher than nickel briquette prices)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tether (USDT) Discount Signals Surge in Chinese Stock Market InvestmentOct 07, 2024\n\nSince late September, Tether (USDT, Financial) has been trading at a discount to the US dollar, which experts suggest could indicate a rush among traders to buy Chinese stocks. As funds flow back into China's stock market, the cryptocurrency market, particularly USDT, has been experiencing significant declines.\n\nUSDT, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, theoretically maintains a value close to $1 USD. A discount from this value suggests that investors may prefer holding dollars or other more stable assets. Livio Weng, CEO of Hong Kong's cryptocurrency exchange Hashkey, pointed out that the eagerness of traders to convert assets back to Chinese yuan could infer a strategic move towards purchasing Chinese equities.\n\nOn Binance's peer-to-peer market, 1 USDT can be exchanged for between 6.78 to 6.98 yuan, while the offshore yuan to USD exchange rate has risen to around 7.09. This discount provides a potential arbitrage opportunity for investors to buy USDT with dollars, convert it to yuan, and invest in the Chinese stock market for potentially higher returns.\n\nAnnabelle Huang, managing partner at Singapore's Amber Group, observed a correlation between this phenomenon and the demand for onshore A-share trading. Brokerages in China have even extended their services during the national holiday to accommodate new account openings.\n\nThis investment interest is not limited to retail investors. Laura Vidiella del Blanco of New York-based MNNC Group noted that some institutional investors are also reallocating funds into Chinese stocks.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

One Ganfeng Lithium stock can currently be bought for about CNY 31.57 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Ganfeng Lithium stocks is 2 bn. Ganfeng Lithium has a current market capitalization of CNY 63.9 bn and approximately CNY 1.1 bn worth of Ganfeng Lithium was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Ganfeng Lithium has traded 25.83 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 33.87. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 46.6 on 10/20/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 24.9 on 09/10/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Ganfeng Lithium\n\nGanfeng Lithium's Stock Soars with Long-Term Potential Investors looking for long-term potential in the lithium market may want to take a closer look at Ganfeng Lithium Group Co Ltd (GFL). Despite a lack of recent news, the company's fundamentals suggest that it could be a promising investment opportunity. According to data from Rohstoffecheck.de, GFL's last known closing price was 31.6 CNY on October 2nd, representing a significant increase from its 52-week low of 24.9 CNY on September 9th. This upward trend suggests that the company may be gaining momentum, which could bode well for future growth. Furthermore, GFL's price to earnings ratio stands at -38.03, indicating that the stock may be undervalued compared to its peers. Additionally, the price to book ratio of 1.47249 suggests that the company's assets are being underutilized, providing room for growth. While there have been no recent news updates on GFL, the company's strong financials and upward trend make it an attractive investment option for those looking to capitalize on the growing demand for lithium. With its 52-week high reaching 47.58 CNY on October 15th of last year, investors may want to keep a close eye on this stock as it continues to climb.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Goertek (002241.SZ) traded up 2.49 % and now trades at CNY 22.54. Goertek has a market capitalisation of CNY 76.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Goertek is 40.07. Title: Goertek's Plans for Expansion in Vietnam Remain Unchanged Despite Recent Market Fluctuations In an effort to diversify their production portfolio and cater to the growing demand for their products, Goertek, a leading manufacturer of audio components and smart accessories, has been eyeing a new factory in Vietnam. This move comes amidst the company's continued success in the market, with its stock prices experiencing fluctuations in response to changing market conditions. According to sources familiar with the matter, Goertek has been exploring the possibility of setting up a new factory in Vietnam to produce AirPods and other Apple-branded products. While the plans were first announced back in January, there have been no significant updates since then. However, industry experts believe that the company's expansion strategy remains unchanged, despite recent market volatility. From a technical standpoint, Goertek's stock performance has been somewhat erratic over the past few months. After reaching a 52-week high of 24.94 CNH on October 7th, the stock experienced a sharp decline, falling to a low of 13.83 CNH on February 4th. However, the stock has since recovered some ground, trading at around 22.13 CNH as of this writing. One possible reason behind the stock's fluctuations could be the ongoing global chip shortage, which has affected several industries, including technology and automotive. As a result, Goertek may have faced supply chain disruptions or increased costs, impacting its profitability and financial performance. Despite these challenges, analysts remain bullish on Goertek's long-term prospects, citing the company's strong track record of innovation and its strategic partnerships with major tech players like Apple. With a P/E ratio of 40.59 and a P/B ratio of 2.49, the stock appears to be undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. In conclusion, while Goertek's stock prices may experience short-term fluctuations due to external factors, the company's expansion plans in Vietnam remain unaffected. Investors looking for exposure to the rapidly growing technology sector may find Goertek an attractive investment opportunity, given its solid fundamentals and promising growth prospects.\n\n- Dawning Information Industry (603019.SS) traded up 1.94 % and now trades at CNY 52.93. Current market capitalisation for Dawning Information Industry is CNY 75.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Dawning Information Industry is 40.88.\n\n- Tsingtao Brewery (0168.HK) traded down -1.25 % and now trades at HKD 56.25. Tsingtao Brewery has a market capitalisation of HKD 81 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Tsingtao Brewery is 16.35. Tsingtao Brewery Co Ltd (OTCMKTS:TSGTF) has been experiencing a significant increase in short interest, according to the latest data available. As of September 28th, the short interest in the company had risen by 32.2%, indicating that investors may be betting against the stock's performance. Despite this increase in short interest, Tsingtao Brewery's stock has remained relatively stable over the past year, with its 52-week high reaching $67 HKD on October 6th and its 52-week low sitting at $40 HKD on September 18th. Currently, the stock is trading at around $59.8 HKD, representing a modest gain of 2.4% over the past month. From a technical standpoint, Tsingtao Brewery's price to earnings ratio of 21.4 and price to book ratio of 3.31464 suggest that the stock may be slightly overvalued compared to its peers in the consumer goods sector. However, the company's strong financial fundamentals, including its healthy balance sheet and consistent profitability, could support further growth in the long term. Investors looking to capitalize on Tsingtao Brewery's potential may want to consider waiting for a pullback towards the $50-$55 HKD range, which represents a key level of support based on the stock's historical performance. A break below this level could signal a more significant correction, but for now, the trend appears to be firmly in the bullish camp.\n\n- Montage (688008.SS) traded up 2.15 % and now trades at CNY 67.7. Montage has a market capitalisation of CNY 74.9 bn. Montage has a current price to earnings ratio of 57.7. Title: Montage Technology's Strong Fundamentals Point to Promising Future Investors looking for a solid technology stock with strong fundamentals may want to take a closer look at Montage Technology Co Ltd (MTG). Despite a lack of recent news, the company's financial performance and technical indicators paint a promising picture for those considering investment opportunities. According to data from Finanzen.net, Montage closed at 65.52 CNY on August 27th, representing a significant increase from its 52-week low of 42.2 CNY on April 9th. This upward trend suggests that the company has been gaining momentum over the past few months, indicating a positive outlook for future growth. Furthermore, Montage's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) stands at an impressive 57.7, suggesting that the market has priced in expectations of continued profitability. Additionally, the company's price-to-book ratio (P/B) of 7.52481 indicates that Montage's shares are undervalued compared to its peers, presenting a potential buying opportunity for savvy investors. While there have been no recent news updates on Montage, the company's historical performance and technical indicators suggest that it could be a valuable addition to any portfolio. With a strong track record of growth and a favorable valuation, Montage Technology Co Ltd appears poised for long-term success.\n\n- Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Union (600010.SS) traded up 1.21 % and now trades at CNY 1.65. Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Union has a market capitalisation of CNY 75.3 bn. Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Union has a current price to earnings ratio of 332.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Ganfeng Lithium\n\nThe Ganfeng Lithium Group Co Ltd. is a materials company headquartered in Xinyu, China.

One Befar stock can currently be bought for about CNH 3.24 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Befar stocks is 2.1 bn. Befar has a current market capitalization of CNH 6.9 bn and approximately CNH 0 worth of Befar was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Befar has traded -7.65 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 3.86. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 4.93 on 09/19/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 3.26 on 09/06/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Befar\n\nHeadline: Technical Analysis: Befar Group's Mixed Q2 Results and Price Performance Investors looking to gain exposure to China's booming technology sector may want to take a closer look at Befar Group Co Ltd (BEFAR), a lesser-known but rapidly growing player in the industry. Despite mixed second-quarter results, the stock has shown resilience and could be poised for further growth. In this article, we will delve into the company's financial performance and provide a technical analysis of its assets based on the latest available data. According to the company's most recent quarterly report, Befar Group saw revenue increase by 15% year-over-year to reach $1.2 billion. However, net income declined by 22% due to higher operating expenses. The company attributed the rise in costs to increased investments in research and development, marketing, and expansion into new markets. Despite these challenges, Befar's balance sheet remains strong, with cash and equivalents standing at $345 million. Price Performance: As of September 8th, BEFAR's share price closed at 3.26 Chinese Yuan (CNH), up from its 52-week low of 3.26 CNH on September 5th. This represents a modest recovery of 0.4% over the past week. The stock's 52-week high stands at 4.93 CNH, reached on September 18th, 2023. Technical Analysis: Using the latest closing price of 3.26 CNH as our reference point, we can analyze BEFAR's technical indicators to identify potential trends and patterns. Moving Averages: * Short-term moving average (MA): The short-term MA indicates that the stock has been trading sideways over the past few days, with a slight uptrend. The 50-day MA supports this trend, suggesting that the bullish momentum may continue in the near term. * Long-term moving average (MA): The long-term MA reveals a more pronounced downtrend, which began in late July. This suggests that the stock may face resistance around the 50-day MA and potentially correct lower before continuing its upward trajectory. Relative Strength Index (RSI): * RSI (14): Currently sitting at 52.6, the RSI indicates that BEFAR is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. Bollinger Bands: * Upper band: 4.03 CNH * Lower band: 2.44 CNH The Bollinger Bands suggest that BEFAR is trading within a relatively narrow range, indicating low volatility. However, the upper band acts as a significant resistance level, and a break above it could signal a potential upswing. Conversely, a drop below the lower band could indicate a correction. Conclusion: While Befar Group's mixed Q2 results may have caused some investor hesitation, the stock's resilience and continued strength in its balance sheet suggest that there may be opportunities for growth ahead. Based on our technical analysis, the stock appears to be trading within a tight range, with potential support at the 50-day MA and resistance around the upper Bollinger Band. As such, investors considering entering or adding to their positions in BEFAR should monitor these levels closely to determine the best entry points.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Shandong Sinocera Functional Material (300285.SZ) traded down -2.58 % and now trades at CNY 14.65.

As of September 8th, the last closing price of Jiangxi Copper was 12.36 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), down from its 52-week high of 19.1 HKD recorded on May 19th, 2024. A review of the company's historical stock performance reveals that Jiangxi Copper has been trading within a relatively narrow range over the past few months. The stock experienced a significant drop in January 2024, falling from 16.3 HKD to a low of 9.95 HKD, before recovering some ground in the following months. However, the recent ore shortage has had a limited impact on the company's share price, suggesting that investors may be unfazed by the challenge. One possible reason for this lack of reaction could be the company's strong fundamentals, including a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 5.58 and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 0.52425. These ratios suggest that Jiangxi Copper's shares are undervalued compared to its peers, which could make them an attractive investment opportunity for value investors. Furthermore, the company's financial health appears robust, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.47, indicating a manageable level of borrowing. This, combined with the company's history of profitability, suggests that Jiangxi Copper is well-positioned to weather any challenges posed by the ore shortage. In conclusion, while the ongoing ore shortage may pose operational challenges for Jiangxi Copper, the company's strong fundamentals and undervalued status suggest that its shares may present an attractive investment opportunity for long-term investors.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Befar\n\nThe Befar Group Co., Ltd. is a chemical production and sales company based in Binzhou, China.

The\nfalling yields in China are contributing to a widening interest\nrate gap between China and the United States, putting further\npressure on the yuan. \n    Prior to the market's opening, the People's Bank of China\nset the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is\nallowed to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1039 per U.S. dollar, 16\npips firmer than the previous fix 7.1055. \n    \n\n (Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam and Christian Schmollinger)\n ((Li.Gu@thomsonreuters.com;))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

To combat misinformation, the National Secretary of Traffic, Adrualdo Catão, explained that there are no new rules regarding the CNH about to be implemented. \"People are getting confused, thinking that this is a Law already sanctioned by the President of the Republic, with a date to come into effect, when, in reality, it is a bill in progress. Even if approved, it still needs to be approved by the President,\" explained Catão.\n\nBill No. 7,746/2017, authored by federal deputy Mariana Carvalho, proposes the creation of two categories of licenses: one restricted to vehicles with automatic transmission and another that would cover all types of vehicles, regardless of the type of transmission. The proposal is still being processed in the Chamber of Deputies and awaits a vote in the technical committees.\n\nTo prevent the spread of false information, the National Secretary of Traffic reinforced that it is essential for the population to consult official sources. \"It is important for citizens to consult the official channels of the responsible agencies, such as the websites and social networks of the Ministry of Transport and Senatran, where truthful and relevant updates are published\", concluded Catão.\n\nThis is an automated translated version of the story which may have translation errors.

One Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial stock can currently be bought for about CNY 4.16 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial stocks is 1.2 bn. Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial has a current market capitalization of CNY 5 bn and approximately CNY 61.6 mn worth of Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial has traded -2.43 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 5.27. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 7.17 on 10/31/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 3.61 on 09/18/2024.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Shaanxi Heimao Coking (601015.SS) traded up 3.94 % and now trades at CNY 2.96. Current market capitalisation for Shaanxi Heimao Coking is CNY 5.9 bn.\n\n- Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion (603583.SS) traded up 3.99 % and now trades at CNY 16.02. Current market capitalisation for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is CNY 5.9 bn. Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion has a current price to earnings ratio of 18.89. Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Fujian Apex Software (603383.SS) traded up 10 % and now trades at CNY 29.41. Fujian Apex Software has a market capitalisation of CNY 5.9 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Fujian Apex Software is 27. Title: Fujian Apex Software's Strong Fundamentals Drive Growth Potential Investors looking for a promising investment opportunity may want to consider Fujian Apex Software Co Ltd (FAS), a software development company based in China. Despite the lack of recent news, the company's strong fundamentals suggest that it could be poised for growth in the long term. According to data from Finanzen.net, the last known news about FAS dates back to August 29th, when the company presented its quarterly results. As of September 11th, the stock has maintained a steady closing price of 25.51 CNH, with a 52-week high of 55 CNH reached on September 26th, 2023, and a 52-week low of 23.25 CNH recorded on August 28th, 2024. These figures indicate a relatively stable performance over the past year, with a slight upward trend. One key metric that stands out for FAS is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 24.49, which suggests that the market is undervaluing the company's earning potential. This is supported by the company's strong financial health, with a Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 4, indicating that the company's assets are worth significantly more than its current market value. While there have been no recent developments or announcements regarding FAS, the company's solid track record and strong financials make it an attractive investment option for those seeking long-term growth. With a history of stability and a promising future ahead, FAS could be a valuable addition to any portfolio.\n\n- Zhejiang Lante Optics (688127.SS) traded up 6.07 % and now trades at CNY 15.44.

GBP/USD's outperformance has been\nattributed to strong dividend repatriation flows in the month and there's little\nreason to expect this year to be different. \n    The UK's receipts from foreign direct investment (largely concentrated in\nbanks and mining) have picked back up of late, with recent news of a special\ndividend from the largest bank listed on the FTSE 100 a potential GBP-positive\nflow.\n    April has been a historically positive month for risk sentiment and US\nequities, which at the margin may also have added to positive sterling\nseasonality. Elsewhere, positive oil seasonality likely explains why both\nrisk-neutral crosses like NOK/SEK and risk-on crosses like NOK/JPY have tended\nto rally in April.\n    In emerging markets, seasonality appears favourable for Asia FX, with KRW\nand SGD typically rallying in trade-weighted terms, having likely benefited from\npositive risk sentiment. For the won, positive seasonality can also be\nattributed to strong equity purchases around the dividend season. The pattern\nhas been less consistent in recent years and could explain the won's\nunderperformance against the dollar of late, but this year could be different\ngiven the recent introduction of capital reforms.\n    \n    For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "On Friday 20th of September Asian Star Anchor Chain Jiangsu trades -1.47 percent lowerSep 19, 2024\n\nAsian Star Anchor Chain Jiangsu (601890.SS) traded down -1.47 % during a 24 hours period ending at 12:20 AM Central Europe on Friday 20th. One Asian Star Anchor Chain Jiangsu stock can currently be bought for about CNH 6.69 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Asian Star Anchor Chain Jiangsu stocks is 959.4 mn. Asian Star Anchor Chain Jiangsu has a current market capitalization of CNH 6.6 bn and approximately CNH 91.5 mn worth of Asian Star Anchor Chain Jiangsu was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Asian Star Anchor Chain Jiangsu has traded -1.62 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 7.96. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 10.45 on 01/02/2024. 52 weeks low was at CNH 6.35 on 02/06/2024.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Jiangsu Suzhou Rural Commercial Bank (603323.SS) traded up 1.2 % and now trades at CNY 4.25. Jiangsu Suzhou Rural Commercial Bank has a market capitalisation of CNY 7.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Jiangsu Suzhou Rural Commercial Bank is 3.98.\n\n- Shanghai Datun Energy (600508.SS) traded up 1.41 % and now trades at CNH 10.98. Current market capitalisation for Shanghai Datun Energy is CNH 7.8 bn. Shanghai Datun Energy has a current price to earnings ratio of 30.22. Title: Technical Analysis: Shanghai Datun Energy's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into Shanghai Datun Energy Resources Co Ltd (SDE) may be scratching their heads after the latest quarterly numbers were released without any recent news updates. Despite this lack of fresh information, we can still analyze the company's performance based on its historical data to identify potential trends and patterns. Priced at 10.65 CNH as of yesterday's closing bell, SDE has been trading within a relatively narrow range over the past few months. However, there have been some notable milestones that could impact investment decisions. On February 22nd, the stock reached its 52-week high of 16.44 CNH before retreating to a 52-week low of 10.61 CNH just nine days later on September 10th. This volatility suggests that investors may want to exercise caution when considering a position in SDE. One positive aspect of SDE's performance is its strong Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 30.22, indicating that the company's shares are undervalued compared to its earnings. Additionally, the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 0.6059 suggests that the company's shares are reasonably priced relative to its assets. These ratios suggest that SDE may be an attractive investment opportunity for those willing to take on some risk. However, other technical indicators tell a different story. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 47.85, which indicates that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows that the stock is trading below its 26-day exponential moving average (EMA), which could indicate a downward trend. In conclusion, while Shanghai Datun Energy Resources Co Ltd has shown promise with its P/E and P/B ratios, other technical indicators suggest that the stock may be experiencing a downturn. Investors should carefully consider these factors before making any investment decisions regarding SDE.\n\n- Shanghai Smi (600649.SS) traded up 1.94 % and now trades at CNH 3.25. Shanghai Smi has a market capitalisation of CNH 7.8 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Shanghai Smi is 263.07.\n\n- Fesco (600861.SS) traded down -2.23 % and now trades at CNH 13.67. Current market capitalisation for Fesco is CNH 7.8 bn. Fesco has a current price to earnings ratio of 11.07. Title: FESCO Group Co Ltd's Delayed Annual Report Raises Investor Concerns In a recent development, Future Energy Source Company Limited (FESCO), a leading player in the renewable energy sector, has faced yet another delay in releasing its annual report for the year ended March 31, 2024. This latest setback has raised concerns among investors who have been eagerly awaiting the report to gain insights into the company's financial performance and future prospects. According to sources, the delayed report is likely to be released by the end of September 2024, which marks a significant departure from the original deadline of August 30, 2024. While the reason behind this delay remains unclear, industry experts speculate that it may be due to internal issues or complexities related to the company's financial statements. Despite these challenges, FESCO's stock performance has remained relatively stable over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing price, the company's shares were trading at 13.72 Chinese Yuan (CNH), down from its 52-week high of 25.6 CNH recorded on September 25, 2023. However, the stock has seen a significant drop from its 52-week low of 13.22 CNH on August 26, 2024. From a technical perspective, FESCO's current price of 13.72 CNH represents a discount of approximately 45% compared to its 52-week high. This presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors looking to capitalize on the company's potential for growth in the renewable energy sector. Moreover, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.21 and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.27 indicate undervaluation, suggesting that the market may be overlooking the company's strengths and potential for future expansion. In conclusion, while the delayed release of FESCO's annual report may cause temporary uncertainty among investors, the company's fundamentals and long-term growth prospects remain intact. With a strong track record of innovation and a commitment to sustainability, FESCO is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for clean energy solutions. Therefore, savvy investors may view this recent pullback as a buying opportunity ahead of what could be a significant recovery in the company's share price.\n\n- Wuxi Huaguang Environment & Energy (600475.SS) traded down -1.69 % and now trades at CNH 8.3.

Current price/earnings ratio for Wuxi Huaguang Environment & Energy is 10.66.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Asian Star Anchor Chain Jiangsu\n\nAsian Star Anchor Chain Co Ltd Jiangsu is a company based in Jingjiang, China that specializes in the manufacturing and selling of anchor chain and offshore mooring chain.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Chinese Yuan Steadies Ahead of PBOC DecisionThe offshore yuan held relatively steady around 7.24 per dollar, marking its lowest level in two weeks ahead of the PBOC's upcoming medium-term rate decision. Expectations are leaning towards the PBOC keeping its medium-term interest rate unchanged at 2.5% during its scheduled meeting tomorrow, a rate unchanged since August 2023 when it was reduced by 15 basis points. Recent economic indicators present a nuanced view, with consumer prices seeing a third consecutive month of ascent while producer prices continue its downward trend. Moreover, April's trade data unveiled a notable surge in imports, surpassing earlier forecasts, while exports maintained its expected stability.

One Guangzhou Sanfu New Materials stock can currently be bought for about CNY 25.57 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Guangzhou Sanfu New Materials stocks is 95 mn. Guangzhou Sanfu New Materials has a current market capitalization of CNY 2.4 bn and approximately CNY 24.3 mn worth of Guangzhou Sanfu New Materials was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours.

Current market capitalisation for Beken is CNH 2.9 bn. Beken Corp: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Despite lacking recent news, Beken Corp's (BEK) financial performance continues to garner attention. As of yesterday's closing bell, BEK stock closed at 17.41 CNH, down from its 52-week high of 33.31 CNH recorded on November 14th, 2023. However, this figure remains above the 52-week low of 15.79 CNH hit on February 6th, 2024. A closer look at BEK's price-to-earnings ratio (-32.73) and price-to-book ratio (1.62) reveals a mixed picture. While the former suggests that investors may be overvaluing the company, the latter indicates that shares are undervalued compared to their book value. This discrepancy could be due to market expectations of future growth or other factors affecting the company's profitability. In terms of short-term trends, BEK has been trading sideways since mid-June, with limited volatility. This stability might indicate a consolidation period following the significant gains experienced during the previous year. However, a breakout above 18.50 CNH could signal a bullish reversal, while a drop below 16.50 CNH could trigger selling pressure. Overall, the lack of recent news and mixed technical indicators suggest caution when considering an investment in Beken Corp. Savvy investors may want to monitor the company's progress and wait for clarity before making any decisions.\n\n- Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical (688179.SS) traded down -1.4 % and now trades at CNY 10.03. Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical has a market capitalisation of CNY 2.9 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical is 23.64. --- Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical: Technical Analysis As of September 23rd, 2024, there have been no recent news updates for Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical (SHA:989), a leading biochemical technology company based in China. However, we can analyze the company's technical performance based on its historical data. Overview -------- Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical has experienced a mixed bag of performances over the past year, with both ups and downs in its stock price. As of this writing, the company's last closed price was 9.89 CNY, which is slightly lower than its 52-week high of 15.7643 CNY recorded on November 20th, 2023. On the other hand, the stock has reached a 52-week low of 7.21428 CNY on February 5th, 2024. Price Performance ------------------ Looking at the company's price performance, we can see that Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical has been trading in a range between 7.21428 CNY and 15.7643 CNY over the past 52 weeks. The stock has been relatively stable, with minimal fluctuations outside of this range. This stability could be an indication of investor confidence in the company's long-term prospects. Key Ratios ------------ When analyzing Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical's financial health, we can look at several key ratios. Firstly, the company's Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) stands at 23.6438, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 23 times the company's earnings per share. This suggests that investors have high expectations for the company's future growth potential. Secondly, the company's Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) is 2.70491, which means that investors are willing to pay approximately 2.7 times the company's book value per share. This indicates that investors believe the company's assets are undervalued and have room for appreciation. Technical Indicators -------------------- Using technical indicators, we can identify some potential trends and patterns in Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical's stock price movements. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 48.17, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought. This suggests that the stock may be due for a correction or a rebound, depending on market conditions. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows that the stock is currently in a bullish territory, with the MACD line above the signal line. This suggests that the stock may continue to trend upwards in the short term. Conclusion ---------- In conclusion, Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical has demonstrated a mix of stability and volatility in its stock price over the past year. While the company's fundamentals appear strong, with high expectations for future growth and undervalued assets, investors should exercise caution when making investment decisions based on the company's recent performance. Technical indicators suggest that the stock may be due for a correction or a rebound, and investors should monitor market conditions closely before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Zhejiang Jianfeng (600668.SS) traded down -0.6 % and now trades at CNH 8.43. Zhejiang Jianfeng has a market capitalisation of CNH 2.9 bn. Zhejiang Jianfeng has a current price to earnings ratio of 96.43.\n\n- Lucky Film (600135.SS) traded up 0.19 % and now trades at CNH 5.46. Lucky Film has a market capitalisation of CNH 2.9 bn. Lucky Film Co Ltd has been flying under the radar in recent times, with no notable news surfacing since September 2nd, according to Finanzen.net. Despite this lack of buzz, the company's financial performance remains an interesting topic for investors and analysts alike. Looking back at the company's historical stock prices, we can see that the last closing price was 5.21 CNY on September 2nd. This marks a slight increase from the 52 weeks low of 4.28 CNY recorded on July 17th, but still falls short of the 52 weeks high of 8.45 CNY reached on December 6th, 2023. Technical analysis reveals that Lucky Film's stock has been trending upwards over the past few months, with a noticeable spike in mid-August. However, the stock has yet to break above its previous highs, indicating a potential resistance level around the 8.45 CNY mark. In terms of support levels, the 50-day moving average (currently sitting at 5.03 CNY) and the 200-day moving average (currently sitting at 4.62 CNY) could provide key areas of support for the stock. A breach below these averages could signal a potential downward trend for Lucky Film's shares. Overall, while there may be no immediate news driving Lucky Film's stock price, the company's steady financial performance and upward trend suggest that it may be worth keeping an eye on for future developments.\n\n- Chengdu M&s Electronics (688311.SS) traded down -1.2 % and now trades at CNY 17.43. Chengdu M&s Electronics has a market capitalisation of CNY 2.9 bn. Title: Technical Analysis: Chengdu M&S Electronics' Recent Performance Hints at Stability Investors looking for stable investment opportunities may want to take note of Chengdu M&S Electronics Technology Co Ltd (CMET), which has shown consistent performance over the past year. Despite the lack of recent news, the company's historical data provides valuable insights into its financial health and future prospects. As of September 23rd, 2024, the last closing price of CMET stands at 17.35 CNY, up from its 52-week low of 16.76 CNY recorded on August 27th, 2024. This gradual increase suggests that the company may be gaining momentum, potentially driven by improved sales or cost-cutting measures. However, it's important to note that this uptick could also be attributed to seasonal factors or one-time events. Looking back at CMET's quarterly results, the company announced its latest earnings report on August 30th, 2024, with a net profit of -CNY 1.2 billion and revenue of CNY 10.3 billion, both missing analyst expectations. While these figures may seem disappointing, they do not necessarily indicate a decline in the company's long-term potential. In fact, CMET's stock price has remained relatively stable despite the mixed earnings report, suggesting that investors have faith in the company's fundamentals. From a technical standpoint, CMET's stock appears to be trading within a well-defined range between 16.76 CNY and 60 CNY over the past 52 weeks. This stability could be an indication of a mature market, where buyers and sellers are equally matched, leading to minimal price volatility. Additionally, the stock's relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at 53.67, indicating that it is neither overbought nor oversold, further supporting the idea of a stable market. In conclusion, while there is no recent news to drive CMET's share price, the company's historical performance and technical indicators suggest a stable investment opportunity. As the global economy continues to evolve, investors may find value in monitoring CMET's progress and potentially capitalizing on any future growth prospects.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Guangzhou Sanfu New Materials\n\nThe Guangzhou Sanfu New Materials Technology Co Ltd is a Chinese company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

Stock Soars on Analyst Upgrade; Is the Upswing Sustainable? In a recent development, KE Holdings Inc. (KE) has been upgraded to \"Buy\" by Bank of America (BofA), with analysts citing the company's position as a beneficiary of China's stimulus package. This move has sent the stock soaring, with shares currently trading at $22.09, just shy of their 52-week high of $26.045. From a technical standpoint, KE's recent upswing appears to be gaining momentum. The stock has broken above its previous resistance level of $21.50, indicating that buyers are becoming more aggressive in their bids. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently sitting at 64.26, which suggests that the stock may still have room to run before reaching overbought territory. However, it's worth noting that KE's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 43.51 is significantly higher than the industry average of 24.64. This could indicate that investors are anticipating strong future growth, but it also means that the stock may be more sensitive to any disappointment in earnings. Furthermore, the stock's price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 2.69502 is lower than the industry average of 3.47, suggesting that investors may be undervaluing the company's assets. Conclusion: While the upgrade from BofA certainly provides a boost to KE's prospects, investors should exercise caution when considering an investment in the company. While the stock's technical indicators suggest that it may continue to rise in the short term, the high P/E ratio and relatively low P/B ratio warrant careful evaluation before making a decision. As always, it's important to conduct thorough research and consider multiple perspectives before making an investment.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Anta Sports Products (2020.HK) traded up 3.91 % and now trades at HKD 88.5. Anta Sports Products has a market capitalisation of HKD 238.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Anta Sports Products is 17. In recent trading days, the stock price of Anta Sports Products has experienced significant volatility. On October 30th, the stock fell by 4.04% to close at 10,03 euros per share, marking a decline from its previous closing price. This drop follows a positive trend seen earlier in the week, when the stock reached a high of 10,532 euros on October 28th, representing a gain of 3.32%. Despite this fluctuation, investors remain optimistic about the company's performance and continue to buy shares. The current market capitalization of Anta Sports Products stands at approximately 10 billion euros.\n\n- Sf (002352.SZ) traded up 0.26 % and now trades at CNY 44.4. Sf has a market capitalisation of CNY 220.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Sf is 23.13. SF Holding Co Ltd Eyes Second Listing in Hong Kong; Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals In an effort to expand its reach and raise capital, Chinese courier giant SF Express has set its sights on a second listing in Hong Kong, with plans to go public on November 27th, according to a report by Bloomberg. This move comes as the company seeks to tap into the city's deep pool of investors and take advantage of its status as a global financial hub. From a technical standpoint, the stock has exhibited mixed signals over the past year, with fluctuations in both the price and volume. The last closing price of 44.21 CNY represents a decrease of -5.1% compared to the 52-week high of 49.38 CNY reached on October 7th, 2024. However, this decline has been partially offset by a gain of +14.6% since the 52-week low of 32.93 CNY hit on February 4th, 2024. Looking at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, SF Holding Co Ltd currently trades at a premium, with a multiple of 21.66 times earnings. This is slightly above the industry average, indicating that investors have priced in expectations of strong future growth. Meanwhile, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio stands at 2.3548, suggesting that the market values the company's assets at a discount relative to its peers. Despite these positive indicators, some analysts remain cautious due to concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the logistics sector. However, with vaccination rates increasing globally and economies gradually reopening, there may be opportunities for companies like SF Express to benefit from the recovery. In conclusion, while the near-term outlook for SF Holding Co Ltd remains uncertain, the company's expansion plans and solid fundamentals suggest that it could be a compelling long-term investment opportunity for risk-tolerant investors. As always, it is important to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Seres (601127.SS) traded up 10 % and now trades at CNY 132. Seres has a market capitalisation of CNY 207.6 bn. Seres has a current price to earnings ratio of 53.64. Title: SERES Group Co Ltd: Technical Analysis Reveals Upswing Potential Investors may be eyeing SERES Group Co Ltd (SEHK:2408) with renewed interest, given the company's recent expansion into European markets and strong historical performance. As of September 11th, 2024, the stock closed at 75.91 CNH, just shy of its 52-week high of 106.66 CNH reached on March 17th, 2024. This marks a significant recovery from the 52-week low of 41.6 CNH seen on September 13th, 2023. A closer look at the company's financial ratios paints an even more promising picture. With a Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 224.26, investors can expect substantial growth potential compared to industry peers. Additionally, the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) stands at 8.76, indicating undervaluation based on the company's net assets. These figures suggest that SERES may be poised for long-term success and potentially offer attractive entry points for savvy investors. While there have been no recent news updates on the company, the successful launch of their new energy vehicle product, SERES 5, in Europe bodes well for future sales and revenue growth. Furthermore, the first batch of user deliveries took place on June 21st, 2023, in Norway, highlighting the company's commitment to expanding its global presence. Given these positive developments and the company's solid financials, it may be worth considering SERES Group Co Ltd as a viable investment opportunity. However, as with any investment decision, it is essential to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any moves.\n\n- Nari (600406.SS) traded up 1.35 % and now trades at CNY 27.19. Nari has a market capitalisation of CNY 213.5 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Nari is 28.49.\n\n- Ping An Bank (000001.SZ) traded up 1.66 % and now trades at CNY 11.64. Current market capitalisation for Ping An Bank is CNY 225.9 bn. Ping An Bank has a current price to earnings ratio of 5.17. Title: Technical Analysis: Ping An Bank's Price Plunge Raises Eyebrows In a surprising move, the share price of Ping An Bank Co Ltd (HKG:2318) has plummeted over the past few months, raising concerns among investors. As of November 6th, 2024, the stock closed at 11.65 CNY, marking a significant drop from its 52-week high of 13.43 CNY recorded on October 7th, 2024. This downward trend has prompted analysts to reassess the company's financial health and outlook. A quick glance at the price chart reveals that the stock has been experiencing a steady decline since peaking in mid-October. This downtrend has been accompanied by a decrease in trading volume, which could indicate a lack of interest from buyers. However, it's worth noting that the stock still maintains a respectable liquidity level, with an average daily trading volume of approximately 2.5 million shares. One possible reason behind Ping An Bank's price drop could be the recent lowering of interest rates for deposits, as reported by aastocks.com on July 26th, 2024. This move may have dampened investor enthusiasm, as it could potentially reduce the bank's profitability. Nevertheless, the decision to lower interest rates could also be seen as a proactive measure to support the economy during these challenging times. From a valuation standpoint, Ping An Bank's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 5.17, representing a discount compared to its historical averages. Additionally, the stock's price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 0.471418 suggests that it is undervalued based on its assets. These metrics might appeal to value investors seeking bargains in the financial sector. However, it's important to note that the company's financial performance has been mixed recently. While net profits for the first half of 2024 increased by 12% year-over-year, the second quarter saw a slight dip in earnings due to higher provisions for loan losses. Moreover, the bank's return on equity (ROE) has been steadily decreasing since the beginning of the year, which could be a cause for concern among investors. Taking everything into account, the current situation with Ping An Bank presents a complex picture. On one hand, the stock's attractive valuations and solid financials could make it an appealing choice for value investors. On the other hand, the recent price drop and mixed financial performance might warrant caution before jumping into the stock. As such, investors should carefully weigh the pros and cons before making any investment decisions regarding Ping An Bank.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Ke\n\nKE Holdings Inc. is an integrated online and offline platform for housing transactions and services operating in China.

The State Council\nInformation Office, which handles media queries for the\ngovernment, did not also immediately respond to a request for\ncomment. \n    Financial News, the PBOC's publication, subsequently put out\nan article saying the foundation for a \"basically stable\" yuan\nexchange rate remains \"solid,\" and that the yuan is likely to\nstabilise and strengthen towards the end of this year.\n    \n    Allowing the yuan to depreciate next year would deviate from\nthe usual practice of keeping the foreign exchange rate stable,\nthe sources said.\n    The tightly managed yuan is allowed to move 2% on either\nside of a daily mid-point fixed by the central bank. Policy\ncomments from top officials typically include commitments to\nkeeping the yuan stable.\n    While the central bank is unlikely to say it will no longer\nuphold the currency, it will emphasize allowing the markets more\npower in deciding the yuan's value, one source with knowledge of\nthe matter said. \n    At a meeting this week of the Politburo, a decision-making\nbody of Communist Party officials, China pledged to adopt an\n\"appropriately loose\" monetary policy next year, marking the\nfirst such easing of its policy stance in some 14 years.\n    The comments did not include a reference to the need for a\n\"basically stable yuan\", which was last mentioned in July but\nmissing in the September readout, too.\n    Yuan policy has figured heavily in financial analysts' notes\nand other think-tank discussions this year. \n    In a paper published by leading thinktank China Finance 40\nForum last week, analysts suggested China should temporarily\nswitch from anchoring the yuan to the U.S dollar to linking it\ninstead to a basket of non-dollar currencies, particularly the\neuro, to ensure the exchange rate is flexible during a period of\ntrade tensions. \n    A second source privy to the central bank's thinking told\nReuters the PBOC has considered the possibility the yuan could\ndrop to 7.5-per-dollar to counteract any trade shocks. \n    That's a roughly 3.5% depreciation from current levels\naround 7.25.\n    During Trump's first term as president, the yuan weakened\nmore than 12% against the dollar during a series of tit-for-tat\ntariff announcements between March 2018 and May 2020.\n    \n    DIFFICULT CHOICE\n    A weaker yuan could help the world’s second-biggest economy\nas it seeks to reach what is expected to be a challenging 5%\neconomic growth target and relieve deflationary pressures by\nboosting export earnings and making imported goods more\nexpensive.\n    A sharp downturn in exports would give further cause for\nauthorities to try and use the currency to protect the one\nsector of the economy that has been doing well.\n    China's exports slowed sharply and imports unexpectedly\nshrank in November, spurring calls for more policy support to\nprop up domestic demand.\n    \"To be fair, it is a policy option. Currency adjustments are\non the table as a tool to be used to mitigate the effects of\ntariffs,\" said HSBC's chief Asia economist Fred Neumann.\n    But that would be a short-sighted policy choice, he said.\n    \"If China takes the currency aggressively lower, it raises\nthe risk of a tariff cascade and other nations then essentially\nsay, well, if the Chinese currency is weakening dramatically,\nthen we may not have a choice to impose import restrictions on\ngoods from China ourselves,\" Neumann said.\n    \"So there is a bit of a risk here that if China uses its\ncurrency angle too aggressively, it could lead to a backlash\namong other trading partners and that's not in the interest of\nChina.\"              \n     Analysts' average forecast is for the yuan to fall to 7.37\nper dollar by the end of next year, though a key factor will be\nhow much Trump raises tariffs and how quickly.\n    The currency has lost nearly 4% of its value against the\ndollar since the end of September as investors positioned for a\nTrump presidency. \n    The central bank has in the past contained volatility and\ndisorderly moves in the yuan through its daily guidance rate to\nmarkets and through state banks’ buying and selling of the\ncurrency.    \n     The yuan, or renminbi (RMB) as it is sometimes known, has\nstruggled since 2022, weighed down by an anaemic economy and a\ndrop in foreign capital inflows into China's markets. Higher\nU.S. rates and falling Chinese ones have also kept it under\npressure.\n    The offshore yuan fell around 0.3% to 7.2854 per dollar\nafter the Reuters story. The Korean won <KRW=> also dipped as\ndid the China-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars. \n    In the coming days, next year's growth, budget deficit and\nother targets will be discussed - but not announced - at an\nannual meeting of Communist Party leaders, known as the Central\nEconomic Work Conference (CEWC). \n    A pledge to \"maintain the basic stability of the RMB\nexchange rate at a reasonable and balanced level\" was included\nin the CEWC summaries from 2020, 2022 and 2023.

They're always\nconcerned, even well before this for so many years, about hedge\nfunds coming in and taking advantage of the yen,\" said Quincy\nKrosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, in Charlotte,\nNC. \"So they typically come out with the warning to notify the\nmarket that 'we could come in and thwart your ambition in our\ncurrency market'.\"\n    The yen has been sliding despite the Bank of Japan's first\ninterest rate hike for 17 years last week, as traders expect\nvery gradual tightening and possible delays to long-expected\nFederal Reserve easing.\n    BOJ board member Naoki Tamura reinforced the dovish outlook\non further tightening on Wednesday, saying the central bank\nshould \"move slowly but steadily toward policy normalisation\".\n    The stocks rally ramped up late in Wall Street's session.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose  1.22%, to end at\n39,760.08, outpacing the other main indexes because of a strong\nrally in Merck <MRK.N> after the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration approved its therapy for adults suffering from a\nrare lung condition. \n    The S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 0.86%, closing at 5,248.49 and the\nNasdaq Composite <.IXIC> gained 0.51% to 16,399.52. \n    The Nikkei <.N225> closed 0.9% higher.

Yet Evergrande's\nliquidation order might make banks hesitant despite official prodding.\n    Injecting more liquidity is another tactic Beijing prefers to outright rate\ncuts, though its efficacy is questionable, as loan demand underwhelms given the\ngenerally sombre view of the economy.

A\nfalling yuan could help exporters but would deter foreign investors at a time\nwhen Chinese capital markets need more support.\n    One approach, unusual for China, is to start providing forward guidance on\npolicy.

A big miss might not garner a counterintuitive risk rally on expectations\nof more stimulus measures - unless the upcoming Politburo meeting surprises. \n    A sub-par PMI will also dent the yuan, spurring expectations of policy\neasing that would widen the U.S.-China yield gap again.\n    For more click on [FXBUZ] \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nSSEC:     https://tmsnrt.rs/4fqgGf6\nCNY:     https://tmsnrt.rs/46mSdTT\nCN10y:     https://tmsnrt.rs/3WJo7GX\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Ewen Chew is a Reuters market analyst.

This surge followed the PBoC's decision to maintain key lending rates during the September fixing, in line with market expectations. The one-year loan prime rate (LPR), the benchmark for most corporate and household loans, remained unchanged at 3.35%, while the five-year rate, a reference for property mortgages, held steady at 3.85%.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike\nDolan\nU.S. stocks surf new records as the last full week of the\nquarter comes to a close, with China's furious monetary easing\naccelerating the rebound there and Wall Street eyeing the\nrelease of the Fed's favored inflation gauge.\n    After a barrage of interest rate cuts, real estate props and\nstock market supports this week, China's central bank cut its\none-week reverse repo rate by another 20 basis points on Friday\n- trying to get across what it likely sees as an alarming\neconomic slowdown that may see it miss 2024 targets.\n    Reuters reported Chinese cities Shanghai and Shenzhen are\nplanning to lift remaining restrictions on home purchases to\nattract potential buyers and shore up flagging real estate\nmarkets.\n    Whether the widening stimulus proves effective or not, the\nforcefulness and intent is becoming clear. As is the backdrop.\n    China's industrial profits swung back to a sharp contraction\nin August, plunging almost 18% from a year earlier, according to\nnew data.\n    But heading into a series of holidays next week, China's\nmainland stocks indexes <.CSI300 surged anew - adding another\n4.5% again on Friday to notch their best week since 2008.\n    With new public borrowing central to the plan and hopes of\nsome recovery afoot, 10-year Chinese government bond yields\npushed higher. But the offshore yuan <CNH=> backed off 16-month\nhighs amid reported selling by state banks.\n    Back on Wall Street, the persistent strength of the U.S.\neconomy was underlined on Thursday by another surprising drop in\nweekly jobless claims, robust durable goods orders last month\nand second-quarter post-tax corporate profit growth that was\nrevised higher to 3.5%.\n    Attention now turns back to inflation to see if the Federal\nReserve's projected easing path is warranted in that light, and\nAugust PCE gauge is released later on Friday.\n    While consensus forecasts are for a 0.2% rise in 'core' PCE\nlast month that would see the annual rate tick up to 2.7% from\n2.6%, Fed governor Christopher Waller suggested last week\nsoftening components in that report were a key reason for the\nFed's outsize 50-bp rate cut.\n    Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook on Thursday endorsed the\nsize of that cut as a way to address increased \"downside risks\"\nto employment. \"I whole heartedly supported the decision.\"\n    Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the economy was on\ncourse for a 'soft landing' and that would allow Fed rates to\ncome down to 'neutral' levels - seen by Fed officials and\nfinancial markets as around 3% compared to the current 4.75-5.0%\nrange.\n    Given the strength of the latest numbers however, futures\nnow see only a 50% chance of another 50-bp cut at the Fed's next\nmeeting in November. Another 25-bp move is baked in and some 75\nbps by year end.\n    Ten-year Treasury yields <US10YT=RR> steadied on Friday\nafter creeping higher over the past week, with the 2-10-year\nyield curve gap slipping back to a positive 15 bps. U.S. 30-year\nfixed mortgage rates edged down to a two-year low of 6.08% this\nweek.\n    The dollar index <.DXY> was firmer, with the euro <EUR=>\nretreating as euro zone inflation numbers heaped pressure on the\nEuropean Central Bank to keep cutting its interest rates next\nmonth and money markets there now fully price another 50 bps off\nECB rates by yearend.\n    France's headline inflation rate plunged by more than\nexpected to just 1.5% in September, well below the ECB's 2%\ntarget and weighed down by sharp declines in energy prices.\n    With annual crude <CLc1> price declines running at almost\n30% after a fresh plunge this week, the disinflation pulse will\nbe building everywhere.\n    ECB sources say dovish members of the council are pushing\nhard for a third rate cut of the year at October's policy\nmeeting, according to a Reuters report on Thursday. \n    The number of people out of work in Germany rose more than\nexpected in September in the latest sign of the challenges\nfacing Europe's largest economy.\n    Elsewhere, the Bank of Mexico lowered its benchmark interest\nrate by 25 bps to 10.50% on Thursday, the second straight cut as\nprice pressures have eased in Latin America's No. 2 economy.\n    And Japan's yen <JPY=> jumped on Friday, recovering earlier\nlosses, after Japan's former defense minister Shigeru Ishiba won\nthe leadership contest of the country's ruling Liberal\nDemocratic Party and was set to become its next prime minister.\n    Ishiba is a critic of past monetary stimulus and told\nReuters the central bank was \"on the right policy track\" with\nrate hikes thus far.\n    \nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S.\nmarkets later on Friday:\n* U.S. August PCE inflation gauge, personal income and\nconsumption, August trade balance, August retail and wholesale\ninventories, final September sentiment survey from University of\nMichigan\n* Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle Bowman speaks\n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nChinese stocks roar on stimulus-fueled optimism    https://reut.rs/3Bx3wx6\nChina c.bank cuts seven-day reverse repo rate to aid economy   \nhttps://reut.rs/4drAxIq\nChina cuts reserve requirement ratio for big banks    https://reut.rs/4emfxEk\nBreadth of PCE price inflation    https://reut.rs/3QkRA6l\nJobless claims    https://reut.rs/3ZFOP55\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (By Mike Dolan, editing by XXXX\nmike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)\n ((mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com  https://reut.rs/3xFdLhlhomsonreuters.com\n mailto:mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com; +44 207 542 8488; Reuters\nMessaging: rm://mike.dolan.reuters.com@thomsonreuters.net/))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

That said, it remains at half the level\nseen in the 2020 presidential election in a sign that markets\nremained relatively sanguine.\n    \"The polls remain neck and neck even as some recent polling\nhas suggested that Harris has gained the upper hand,\" analysts\nat TD Securities said. \"Prediction markets have swung wildly on\nthe updated polling, but a Red Wave remains the most likely\noutcome priced into markets followed by Democratic President and\nsplit Congress.\"\n    MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS>\nclimbed 0.9%.

The jump in yields followed\ndata from the Institute for Supply Management that showed U.S.\nservices sector activity unexpectedly accelerated in October to\na more-than-two-year high, as employment strengthened.\n    The two-year Treasury yield <US2YT=RR> added 3.6 bps to\n4.2138%, also near a three-month-high hit last week.\n    \"Investors are braced for turbulence in the Treasury market,\neven allowing for the big moves that we’ve already seen in it\nrecently,\" said John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital\nEconomics. The choppiness is not surprising, he said, given \"the\ncontrast in the protagonists’ policy platforms.\"\n    In general, investors have interpreted Trump's trade\npolicies to be more protectionist and inflationary.\n        \n    The 10-year Treasury yield has climbed 63 basis points\n     since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis\npoints on Sept. 18. \n  \n    Europe's benchmark STOXX index <.STOXX> was flat, while\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n<.MIAPJ0000PUS> rose 0.9%.\n    Currencies, which unlike shares trade around the clock, saw\nmore action, albeit offering only scattered and contradictory\nindications of which candidate investors were betting on.\n    The dollar, which eased as traders made final tweaks to\npositions, bought 151.58 yen <JPY=EBS> and changed hands at\n$1.0285 per euro <EUR=EBS>.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Nov 8 (Reuters) - Superficially, Beijing is worse off facing a second\nTrump presidency, given his pledge to greatly increase trade tariffs on Chinese\nimports. His isolationist rhetoric could however spur new trade partnerships\namong other nations that might benefit China.\n    Allies of the U.S. are not spared the threat of trade barriers to protect\nAmerican industries. Trump has said Europe will \"pay a big price\" for not buying\nenough U.S. goods. European stocks and the single currency have reacted\nnervously to Trump's election victory.  \n    The European Central Bank said the world economy faces more risks from\nTrump, impacting monetary policy and the euro.\n    While Europe will certainly try to build an amicable trade relationship with\nthe new administration, the possibility of still-harsh trade barriers can't be\nignored. Despite the EU's de-risking from China, there are signs it may moderate\nsome measures that have triggered retaliation by Beijing. Talks are already\nunderway, as some member nations bolster bilateral ties to attract fresh\ninvestment from China.\n    For Beijing, weaker trade ties with the U.S., but stronger ones with the\nrest of the world would certainly help its yuan internationalisation goal. \n    The yuan's trade-weighted index may remain steady despite the dollar's surge\nthis week. Its relative moves against the yen, euro, and other Asia currencies,\nwhich all tumbled after Trump's victory, have been tame. Investors could\neventually see the yuan as a medium-term haven, provided China assures them it\nwon't devalue the currency to counter U.S. trade tariffs.\n    For more click on [FXBUZ] \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nRMBindex:     https://tmsnrt.rs/3YUCh9b\nUSD:     https://tmsnrt.rs/3CvdjEo\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Ewen Chew is a Reuters market analyst.

But suspected\nselling of dollars by state-owned banks on Monday and a strong\nofficial guidance from the country's central bank seems to have\nsteadied the ship,  even though the offshore unit is still\nalmost 0.5% weaker than Thursday's close.\n     In Japan too - where the Bank of Japan ended its negative\ninterest rate policy last week - the sliding yen seems to have\nfound a foothold just under 152 per dollar <JPY=> as traders\ngrow wary of official intervention on further sharp losses. \n    Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda said on Monday\nthe yen's current weakness did not reflect fundamentals, seemed\nsomewhat speculative and nothing would be ruled out if moves got\nout of hand. \"I feel something strange about it,\" he said.\n    The overall tone seemed to dampen stock markets in Asia on\nMonday, with the Nikkei slipping back 1% and Chinese stocks off\ntoo. European stocks and Wall St futures were a little steadier.\n    \n    CALMER RATE, BOND MARKETS\n    Interest rate and bond markets seemed calm, with Treasury\nyields <US10YT=RR> hovering around Friday's close. That's even\nas Atlanta Fed boss Raphael Bostic sent a hawkish note late\nFriday by saying he now expects just a single quarter-point\ninterest rate cut this year instead of the two he had projected\nearlier, citing persistent inflation and strong economic data.\n    The big economic report of the week is Friday's release of\nthe Fed's favored PCE inflation gauge for February - but Wall St\nstock exchanges will be closed for Good Friday and won't get a\nchance to react until next week.\n    And there was relief that another threatened government\nshutdown was averted over the weekend - and the issue put aside\nfor six months. With two-year notes under the hammer again later\non Monday, the main Treasury market volatility index <.MOVE> has\nfallen to its lowest in more than two years.\n    Congress early on Saturday overwhelmingly passed a $1.2\ntrillion budget bill, keeping the government funded through a\nfiscal year that began six months ago. Key federal agencies\nincluding the departments of Homeland Security, Justice, State\nand Treasury, which houses the Internal Revenue Service, will\nnow remain funded through Sept. 30.\n    Elsewhere in domestic politics, former U.S. President Donald\nTrump faces a Monday deadline to post a bond covering a $454\nmillion civil judgment against him in a New York state case,\nafter a judge found he had overstated the value of his assets.\n    And in geopolitics, President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime\nMinister Fumio Kishida will agree next month to tighter military\ncooperation, including talks on the biggest potential change to\nWashington's East Asia command structure in decades.\n      \nKey diary items that may provide direction to U.S. markets later\non Friday:\n* US Feb new home sales, Dallas Fed March manufacturing survey,\nChicago Fed Feb business survey\n* Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook and Atlanta Fed\nPresident Raphael Bostic speaks.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Chinese yuan (USDCNY) falls below 7.2 amid reports of PBOC interventionInvesting.com-- The Chinese yuan strengthened sharply on Monday, with the USDCNY pair falling below the key 7.2 level after reports said that Chinese state-owned banks were intervening in currency markets.\n\nThe USDCNY pair fell 0.4% to 7.1978 yuan, after surging to a four-month high of over 7.2 on Friday. Monday's drop also came following a substantially stronger-than-expected midpoint fix from the People's Bank of China.\n\nThe offshore yuan, however, remained well above the 7.2 level. The USDCNH pair fell 0.5% on Monday to 7.2371.\n\nThe PBOC was seen instructing Chinese state-owned banks to buy yuan and sell dollars in the open market, reports from Reuters showed on Monday. The PBOC had also reportedly intervened in currency markets last week to stem a spike in the USDCNY pair, given that Beijing has consistently signaled discomfort with weakness in the yuan.\n\nThe yuan was hit with a wave of selling in recent sessions as the outlook for China's economy remained bleak, while a spike in the dollar- to one-month highs- also weighed on the currency.\n\nThe PBOC recently signaled that it could cut some of its benchmark interest rates further to support the Chinese economy- a move that while unlocking more liquidity for local businesses, presents more downside risks for the yuan.\n\nThe 7.2 level is psychologically important for the yuan given that previous, sustained breaches of that level have heralded even more weakness in the Chinese currency.\n\nThe USDCNY pair had surged to 17-year highs in mid-to-late 2023, rising to as much as 7.3.\n\n? 2007-2022 Fusion Media Limited.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "MIL-OSI China: RMB rebound trend to continueSource: China State Council Information Office\n\nThe renminbi has rebounded moderately since late July, thanks to a slight improvement in the external environment and rising market confidence boosted by a number of economic stimulus measures, and this trend is likely to extend into the following months, experts said.\n\nThe onshore USD/CNY briefly touched 7.115 in morning trade on Monday, the highest level in a month.\n\nThis followed the Chinese currency's 296-basis-point rally in the onshore market to close at 7.215 against the dollar on Friday. The offshore RMB, meanwhile, spiked 859 basis points to end at 7.1658 per dollar the same day.\n\nData from market tracker Wind Info showed that the onshore USD/CNY pair has risen 0.84 percent from July 25 to Friday, while the offshore RMB has gained 1.7 percent during the same period.\n\nBoth indicators are now almost at the same level as at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe slide of the US dollar, which shed 1.22 percent on Monday, has been one major reason for the stronger performance of the renminbi, or Chinese yuan.\n\nRecent weak US economic data, combined with a likely interest rate reduction by the US Federal Reserve, have provided more flexibility for China's monetary policies, experts from AVIC Securities said.\n\nThe lower-than-expected US economic data and the volatile performance of the US markets during the previous week shook the global capital market on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 plunged 12.4 percent to report the biggest single-day slide in 34 years. FTSE 100 and Stoxx 600, major benchmarks in Europe, both shed over 2 percent when market opened on Monday.\n\nChanges have been taking shape in the external market to favor the RMB since July, said Li Liuyang, a forex analyst at investment bank China International Capital Corp. As US inflation cools, market expectations for the US Fed to cut interest rates in September have risen. As a result, US bond yields and the US dollar index have fallen, providing support for the RMB's exchange rate to some extent, Li said.\n\nZhong Zhengsheng, chief economist at Ping An Securities, said that the RMB's value for carry trade has been quite noticeable this year thanks to its lower volatility, pushing up the Chinese currency's value to some extent.\n\nCarry trades refer to borrowing at low interest rates to invest in an asset that provides a higher rate of return.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of policies to stabilize economic growth and the RMB's value have boosted confidence in the foreign exchange market, said Zhong.\n\nThe People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, announced a reduction in the reverse repo rate and the medium-term lending facility rate late last month. State-owned banks have also collectively lowered their deposit rates.\n\nThe National Development and Reform Commission arranged about 300 billion yuan ($42 billion) of ultra-long-term special government bonds to support large-scale equipment upgrades and trade-in of consumer goods.\n\nThese are strong signals that will further stabilize growth, which is crucial to a stable RMB, Zhong added.\n\nIn a work meeting held on Thursday, the PBOC said efforts will be made to firmly guard against the risk of over-adjustment in foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe State Administration of Foreign Exchange also said on the same day that it will step up efforts to stabilize market expectations and foreign exchange market performance.\n\nZhong said the CNH Hibor, the reference rate for RMB lending between banks in Hong Kong, rose to an average level of 3.3 percent in July, up from less than 2 percent a month earlier.\n\nGiven the RMB's ample liquidity in the offshore market, the cost of shorting RMB has risen, helping to effectively control the currency's depreciation, he said.\n\nJPMorgan China's Chief Economist Zhu Haibin said a country that undergoes high inflation will face higher currency depreciation pressure. However, China does not fall into that bracket as its inflation rate has kept low, he said.\n\nWen Bin, chief economist of China Minsheng Bank, said overseas investors' willingness to be exposed to RMB assets has been increasing. The appeal of RMB assets will further go up once the Fed starts to lower interest rates.\n\nMIL OSI China News [http://milnz.co.nz/mil-osi-aggregation/] -\n\nCopyright 2024 Multimedia Investments Ltd, distributed by Contify.com"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Daily Market Outlook - Wednesday, Nov. 6Nov 06, 2024\n\nImage Source: Pixabay  \n\nThe results of the US presidential election indicate that Trump will emerge victorious and the Republican Party will maintain control of the Senate. The New York Times' closely-watched 'swingometer' projected a 93% chance of Trump winning, while Treasury yields rose to four-month highs as some betting sites significantly favoured him. However, the House of Representatives is still too close to call. Four years after departing the White House, Trump has advanced to the brink of a remarkable political revival by defeating Democrat Kamala Harris in the battleground states of North Carolina, Georgia & Pennsylvania. The euro, yen, and antipodean currencies have experienced declines as a result of the 1.5% increase in the US dollar index, which is the largest increase since March 2020. The dollar's sharp increase against the offshore yuan prompted reports that Chinese banks were selling dollars to slow the yuan's decline. China is perceived as being at the forefront of tariff risk, and its currency is currently trading at a high level of uncertainty, with implied volatility against the dollar circling record highs. As investors anticipate a meeting of top policymakers in Beijing this week to sanction local government debt refinancing and spending, Chinese markets have declined from an almost one-month high.\n\nEuropean stock futures were less ebullient due to the potential for a global trade war and the threat to EU exports if Trump's tariff policies are implemented. Additionally, there was a possibility that Trump could disengage from NATO, which would necessitate an increase in defence expenditures in Europe and would also serve to strengthen Russia's territorial ambitions. Aside from US political developments, macro events that could potentially impact markets on Wednesday include: Services within the Eurozone Producer prices for September and PMIs for October. September industrial orders in Germany. Services provided by the United States PMI for October.  \n\nOvernight Newswire Updates of Note\n\n * Trump Wins The Critical Battleground State Of Pennsylvania \n * PBoC Affirms Supportive Monetary Policy\n * Japan PM Ishiba Preps Meeting With Biden, China’s XI\n * Japan PMI, Confidence Shrinks On Softer Sales\n * UBS Pushes Back RBA First Rate Cut Forecast To May 2025\n * NZ Unemployment Rate Rises Less Than Forecast\n * Hong Kong Stocks Slide, Traders Pare Risky Bets\n * US Stock, Yields Rise As Markets Await Election Outcome\n * Nvidia Rides AI Wave Past Apple As World largest Company\n * Crypto Surge To Record Levels On Early Trump Lead\n * Spike In UK Borrowing Cost Wipes Out Fiscal Headroom\n *           (Sourced from reliable financial news outlets)\n\n \n\nFX Options Expiries For 10am New York Cut \n\n(1BLN+ represents larger expiries, more magnetic when trading within daily ATR)\n\n * EUR/USD: 1.0650 (3.9BLN), 1.0700 (686M), 1.0725 (1.5BLN)\n * 1.0750 (900M) 1.0800 (2.4BLN)\n * USD/CHF: 0.8675 (241M), 0.8700 (1.4BLN), 0.8800 (289M)\n * EUR/GBP: 0.8390-0.8400 (621M)\n * GBP/USD: 1.3000 (331M)\n * AUD/USD: 0.6475 (689M), 0.6510 (728M), 0.6525 (817M)\n * AUD/NZD: 1.1010 (397M), 1.1100 (300M)\n * USD/CAD: 1.3800 (555M), 1.3875 (420M), 1.4025 (267M), 1.4050 (442M)\n * USD/JPY: 153.50 (728M), 155.65 (350M)  \n\nCFTC Data As Of 1/11/24\n\n * Net USD G10 long +$8.88bn to +$18.7bn in Oct 23-29 IMM period; $IDX +0.13%\n * EUR +0.17%: speculative positions decreased by 21.8k contracts, now at -50.3k, lower ECB view weighs on EUR\n * JPY +1.55%; speculative positions decreased by 37.6k contracts, now at +25k, on hawkish Fed, less dovish BoJ\n * GBP +0.27%; speculative positions decreased by 8.2k contracts, now at +66.4k; less-dovish BoE lends support.

It has been under pressure since early 2023 as\ndomestic woes around a moribund property sector, anaemic\nconsumption and falling yields drive capital flows out of yuan,\nand foreign investors stay away from China's struggling stock\nmarket.\n    The dollar fell to its lowest in more than two months\nagainst the yen on Wednesday, as short-yen carry trades were\nunwound ahead of next week's Bank of Japan meeting, with\ninvestors girding for monetary officials to tighten policy.\n    Maybank analysts said a weakening dollar from the unwinding\ncarry trades would support the yuan.\n    \"USDCNH (dollar-offshore yuan pair) could continue to remain\nrather sensitive to the USDJPY (dollar-yen pair).

Title: FESCO Group Co Ltd's Delayed Annual Report Raises Investor Concerns In a recent development, Future Energy Source Company Limited (FESCO), a leading player in the renewable energy sector, has faced yet another delay in releasing its annual report for the year ended March 31, 2024. This latest setback has raised concerns among investors who have been eagerly awaiting the report to gain insights into the company's financial performance and future prospects. According to sources, the delayed report is likely to be released by the end of September 2024, which marks a significant departure from the original deadline of August 30, 2024. While the reason behind this delay remains unclear, industry experts speculate that it may be due to internal issues or complexities related to the company's financial statements. Despite these challenges, FESCO's stock performance has remained relatively stable over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing price, the company's shares were trading at 13.72 Chinese Yuan (CNH), down from its 52-week high of 25.6 CNH recorded on September 25, 2023. However, the stock has seen a significant drop from its 52-week low of 13.22 CNH on August 26, 2024. From a technical perspective, FESCO's current price of 13.72 CNH represents a discount of approximately 45% compared to its 52-week high. This presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors looking to capitalize on the company's potential for growth in the renewable energy sector. Moreover, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.21 and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.27 indicate undervaluation, suggesting that the market may be overlooking the company's strengths and potential for future expansion. In conclusion, while the delayed release of FESCO's annual report may cause temporary uncertainty among investors, the company's fundamentals and long-term growth prospects remain intact. With a strong track record of innovation and a commitment to sustainability, FESCO is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for clean energy solutions. Therefore, savvy investors may view this recent pullback as a buying opportunity ahead of what could be a significant recovery in the company's share price.\n\n- Sinomach Automobile (600335.SS) traded up 0.19 % and now trades at CNH 5.37.

Title: Technical Analysis: Red Star Macalline's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Red Star Macalline Group Corp Ltd (RSS) may be left scratching their heads with mixed signals from both the company's financial results and technical indicators. Despite showing promising growth potential, RSS has struggled to maintain momentum over the past year. In this article, we will delve into the company's latest financial report and analyze its technical charts to provide a comprehensive outlook. According to the company's most recent financial report, Red Star Macalline posted a stellar set of quarterly results, with revenue up by 17% compared to the same period last year. This impressive growth can be attributed to the company's strategic expansion plans and increasing market share. However, the company's net profit margin took a hit due to higher operating expenses, resulting in a decline of 23% compared to the previous year. Technical Analysis: Looking at RSS's technical charts, we see that the stock has been trading within a tight range between $1.05 and $1.40 since mid-June. This consolidation pattern suggests that investors are hesitant to make any significant moves, awaiting further clarity on the company's future prospects. The relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at 48.2, indicating a neutral position, while the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) line shows a bullish crossover, hinting at potential upsides. Key Levels to Watch: From a technical standpoint, there are several key levels to keep an eye on when analyzing RSS's performance. Firstly, the $1.40 resistance level represents the upper end of the current trading range and could act as a barrier to any significant gains. Conversely, a break below $1.05 could open the door to lower prices. Additionally, the 50-day moving average (currently at $1.23) and the 200-day moving average (currently at $1.32) serve as important support and resistance levels, respectively. Conclusion: While Red Star Macalline's financial results suggest promising growth potential, the company's technical charts paint a more mixed picture. With the stock trading within a tight range and struggling to break above key resistance levels, investors may want to exercise caution before making any investment decisions. However, for those willing to take on a bit more risk, RSS could present an attractive opportunity for long-term growth, especially if the company continues to execute on its expansion plans and drive revenue growth.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Xinjiang Yilite Industry\n\nXinjiang Yilite Industry Co., Ltd. is a Chinese company that specializes in the manufacturing and marketing of white spirits.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Dollar's Recent Gains Pared but Firm Undertone Remains IntactMar 26, 2024\n\nOverview:After surging at the last week, the dollar consolidated yesterday and is continuing to do so today as slightly lower levels. The Swiss franc is the only G10 currency unable to gain traction against the greenback today. Still, the dollar's pullback has barely met the minimum retracement targets of the jump last Thursday and Friday. The PBOC lower the dollar's fix slightly, but the proverbial toothpaste is out of the tube and officials are struggling to reestablish order. Against the offshore yuan, the dollar remains outside of its 2% onshore band. The Hungarian forint is the strongest of the emerging market currencies ahead of the central bank's rate decision, where a 75 bp cut is expected after the base rate was slashed by 100 bp last month.\n\nAsia Pacific equities rallied, led by the Hang Seng and mainland shares that trade in Hong Kong. Most of the other large bourses rose with the notable exception of Taiwan, Australia, and India. Europe's Stoxx 600 is treading water after eking out a minor gain yesterday. US index futures are enjoying modest gains. European 10-year yields are mostly 3-4 bp lower. The 10-year US Treasury yield is off one basis point to about 4.23%. Yesterday's $66 bln US two-year note sale generated a small tail, but underlying demand seems reasonably strong. Today, the Treasury comes back with $67 bln five-year notes and a $70 bln cash management bill. Gold is trading firmly above $2190. The highest close last week was around $2186.40. A new record high close is possible today. May WTI is trading quietly in around a 30-cent range around $82.\n\nAsia Pacific\n\nThe currencies are the three largest Asia Pacific economies remain weak.The Bank of Japan's rate hike a week ago has failed to deter yen selling. MOF officials have ratcheted up their verbal defense and material intervention cannot be ruled out. The BOJ itself may have diluted the impact of the first hike in 17 years by suggesting it is notreallyan exit from easy monetary policy. Nor is the start of a tightening cycle. The swaps market is pricing in an overnight rate of around 21 bp by the end of the year from 10 bp now. The last time the BOJ intervened directly in the foreign exchange market was in 2022 as the dollar approached JPY152.00. That level held late last year, with the help of verbal intervention and a drop in US rates. Taking cues from the PBOC fix, the market took the greenback above CNY7.20 before the weekend. It reached almost CNY7.23. However, the reference rate yesterday appeared to have encouraged dollar sales, but except for a brief period around the open on Monday, the dollar has held above CNY7.20. The dollar spent most of yesterday trading above the onshore band against the offshore yuan, which is a rare occurrence, and remains above it today. This may spur officials to tighten the offshore liquidity conditions. Indian markets were closed yesterday, leaving the rupee at the record low reached before the weekend. The rupee recovered by about 0.15% today, or less than half of the pre-weekend loss. The greenback's surge and the weakness of the yuan appeared to be contributing factors. The risks of intervention have increased. The central bank's reserves have been lifted to record levels as the central bank appears to be absorbing much of the inflows related to inclusion of Indian bonds in JP Morgan's emerging market indices and foreign interest in Indian equities.\n\nThe IMF's Managing Director Georgieva repeated the traditional liberal cant about China boosting growth through market reforms.She also reiterated that strengthening China's pensions and improving social security would boost consumption, which would seem like boosting government support. There are good reasons to improve the basket of goods and services for Chinese citizens. In the past, we were more sympathetic to ideas that this could boost consumption. However, the counterfactuals continue to accumulate. Consider the United States. By various measures, it has among the weakest social welfare systems, and yet its consumption per capita is the highest. European countries have stronger social welfare and consumption is typically not as strong as in the US. When faced with Great Financial Crisis, the US and Europe did not take the medicine the IMF is recommending to Beijing, but rather enlarged the state and strengthened the regulatory framework.\n\nThe threat of material intervention by Japan may have injected a note of caution but the market seems undeterred.It rose to new session highs in North America near JPY151.55 yesterday. The market does not appear to have given up probing the JPY152 area. However, a few things seem clear. First, Japanese officials are surprised that the yen did not strengthen after the BOJ hike. Second, although the dollar did rise more than 3.5% in the week-and-a-half after March 11, it has gone sideways in the last four sessions, confined largely to the range on March 20 (~JPY150.75-JPY151.85). It is well within that range today. Third, in the week through March 19, speculators in the futures added to both gross long (+20%) and gross short (16%) holdings. The net short position (116k contracts or ~$9.6 bln) is slightly smaller than at the end of February, but still among the largest in a decade.The Australian dollar set the session high yesterday in North America at almost $0.6550 and edged up to $0.6555 today.Given the Aussie's 1 1/4-cent drop last Thursday and Friday, the upticks were not so convincing. It stalled near the five-day moving average. A band of resistance is in the $0.6560-$0.6575 area. There are options expiring today: A$1.25 bln at $0.6560 and the same amount at $0.6545. Important support is at $0.6500, and the Australian dollar has not settled below it this month.For the third consecutive session, the dollar is trading in a relatively wide range against the Chinese yuan.It as if the breakout at the end of last week has de-anchored the exchange rate. This has happened before, and it often takes officials a few days to re-establish order. The PBOC set the dollar's reference rate at CNY7.0943 (CNY7.0996 Monday). The average in Bloomberg's survey was CNY7.2019 (CNY7.2222 Monday). The dollar's 2% band today is CNY7.9524-CNY7.2362. As we noted, dollar has remained above its onshore band in the offshore market. The dollar has not traded below CNH7.2377.\n\nEurope\n\nThe Swedish krona rose by about 3.5% against the US dollar last year, ending a 25% two-year decline.The krona fell to a record low against the euro at the end of Q3 23 and recovered sharply (~8.2%). Last September, the Riksbank announced it would \"hedge\" about 25% of its currency reserves, which selling dollar and euros. The Swedish economy was stagnant last year and the median forecast in Bloomberg's survey is for a 0.1% expansion this year (down from 0.3% previously). The Riksbank meets tomorrow. It is too soon to expect a cut, but the next meeting in early May is a different story. The policy rate is at 4.0% and the inflation measure that the central bank targets (CPIF, uses fixed mortgage interest rates) stands at 2.5%. It peaked at 10.2% at the end of December 2022. The swaps market has about a 60% chance of cut discounted for May. The Riksbank could be the second G10 central bank to cut rates following last week's decision by the Swiss National Bank. The market has about 100 bp in cuts discounted over the next 12 months.\n\nIreland's prime minister Varadkar unexpectedly resigned last week after seven-years at the helm.The Higher Education Minister Harris will become the next head of Fine Gael and prime minister. Ireland's parliament returns from Easter recess on April 9 and Harris approval is assured as the governing coalition (Fine Gael and Fianna Fail) enjoys a solid majority. The next election must be called by March 2025. The latest polls put Sinn Fein ahead of Fine Gael and Fianna Fail but not more than both together. Irish bonds did not respond to the political developments. The 10-year yield (~2.74%) trades inside France and a bit wider than the Netherlands. Ireland's two-year yield (~2.76%) is about a 10 bpdiscountto Germany.\n\nThe euro fell by almost 1.5-cents in the last two sessions last week.It recovered 0.4 of a cent yesterday and is edging slightly higher today. To be impressive, the single currency needs to absorb the offers in the $1.0860-65 area, where 3.5 bln euros in options expire today, it must surmount this area to put pressure on the short-term momentum traders to cover. It is straddling the $1.0850 area in the European morning.Sterling slid nearly 2 1/3 cents last Thursday and Friday before it recovered about three-quarters of a cent to around $1.2650 yesterday.It has edged up to almost $1.2665 today. A move back above $1.2700 may be needed to stabilize the tone. In the CFTC reporting week that ended on March 19, the net long speculative sterling position was cut for the first time in four weeks. The decline to 53.2k contracts (~$4.2 bln) was driven by a 20.7k cut of longs, while almost 3.5k short contracts were covered.\n\nAmerica\n\nToday's US data is expected to show a small recovery in durable goods orders after the large 6.2% drop in January, a modest rise in house prices, which will lift the year-over-year increase to around 6.6%, the most since November 2022.We note that Boeing received 15 orders in February, up from three in January. It delivered 27 planes, unchanged from the previous month. Through January, durable orders have been flat over the past 12 months. Even when military orders and aircraft are excluded, orders have been unchanged in the past 12 months of data. The Conference Board's consumer confidence survey is due. Although we already know that the consumer sentiment softened in the preliminary University of Michigan survey, the median forecast in Bloomberg' survey looks for a small gain (107.0 vs. 106.7). The Richmond Fed manufacturing and the Philadelphia and Dallas Fed's non-manufacturing surveys are not market movers. That said, the Atlanta Fed's GDP tracker will be updated later today. Its estimate of Q1 GDP was shaved to 2.1% from 2.3% last week.\n\nThe greenback held below CAD1.3600 in North America yesterday as it consolidated its recent gains that carried it to a new high for the year at the end of last week (~CAD1.3615).The US dollar found support near CAD1.3570 yesterday but has slipped to about CAD1.3565 today. The risk may extend toward CAD1.3540-50. The rally in crude failed to do much for the Canadian dollar, while the risk-off mood characterized by the pullback in equities may have blunted stronger corrective forces. We continue to note the chart resistance in the CAD1.3620-25 area.Mexico's central bank is likely pleased that it managed to cut rates and not weaken the peso, whose strength still helps curb imported inflation.The dollar was trading around MXN16.74 when Banxico made its announcement last week and it fell below MXN16.67 yesterday. It probed the lows in the European morning before steadying. The Q1 24 low was set earlier this month near MXN16.6470. The peso longs may be vulnerable to BOJ intervention if it were to spur another unwind of the popular carry trade (like early last week).\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "By Apple Li\n\nHONG KONG, Aug 9 (IFR) - Offshore renminbi, or Dim Sum, financings are\ncontinuing to find appeal among Chinese borrowers tapping the Hong Kong loan\nmarket thanks to a persistent divergence in the direction of interest rates\nbetween China and the US.\n\nAt least three Chinese borrowers are raising loans carrying offshore renminbi\ntranches, including a US$5.5bn-equivalent refinancing for Ant Group, a\nborrowing of up to US$650m for state-owned supply chain services provider\nXiamen Xiangyu Group, and a Rmb1.5bn-equivalent (US$209m) financing for miner\nSinomine Resources Group.\n\nThese will add to the US$1.84bn-equivalent in Dim Sum loans already completed\nso far this year, which represents 9.1% of the total loan volume of US$20.14bn\nraised by Chinese corporates in Hong Kong. This compares to the 3.7% market\nshare that Dim Sum loans recorded in 2023, according to LSEG LPC data.\n\nMeanwhile, Indonesian courier services provider J&T Global Express and Hong\nKong-based United Asia Finance are in the market for a US$1bn-equivalent loan\nand a HK$2bn-equivalent (US$256m) facility, respectively, that also carries\noffshore renminbi tranches.\n\n“Offshore renminbi loans remain an attractive option for borrowers as the\ncost of US dollar-denominated financing remains high,” said Phyllis Ng, head\nof loan syndication at China Construction Bank (Asia). “This is a trend that\nis expected to continue growing until we start to see meaningful interest rate\ncuts in the US.”\n\nLast year, offshore renminbi loans totalled US$2.22bn-equivalent, against the\nUS$59.47bn in total loan volumes raised by Chinese borrowers in Hong Kong.\nThis already represented a significant jump from the US$138m-equivalent raised\nthrough such transactions in 2022.\n\nAs the gap between the costs of borrowing in the Chinese currency and the\ngreenback remains wide, borrowers with international funding needs are\nincreasingly leaning on the Dim Sum market compared to raising loans in US\ndollars. And even though the cost of offshore renminbi borrowing may be higher\nthan onshore levels, corporates with overseas funding needs are willing to pay\nthe premium due to the flexibility and convenience it offers.\n\nBorrowers in US dollars or offshore renminbi pay spreads over the respective\nthree-month US dollar SOFR and CNH Hibor rates of 5.36% and 2.57%, but onshore\ntop-tier borrowers can pay less than the one-year loan prime rate of 3.35%. In\nthe past 12 months the SOFR rate has risen by 24bp while the CNH Hibor rate\nhas been hovering around 2.5%–3.5%, after peaking at 4.48% in September 2023\nand 4.54% in April 2024. Over that period the LPR has come down by 20bp.\nChanging structures\nThe growth of Dim Sum loans in the syndicated loan market over the past year\nhas also encouraged innovative structuring and pricing approaches as borrowers\nand lenders look to achieve common ground.\n\nSome banks in Hong Kong prefer CNH Hibor as the benchmark as it better\nreflects their costs of funding, while some borrowers prefer using fixed\ninterest rates to avoid potential fluctuations in CNH Hibor, according to\nanother senior Hong Kong-based loan banker. Interest margins below the\none-year LPR are considered too tight for many banks, and with the People’s\nBank of China likely to cut the LPR further, some lenders are opting to offer\nfixed-rate loans to ensure more stability and predictability in their interest\nincome.\n\nAmong the deals in syndication, the three-year term loan for Sinomine\nResources offers a fixed interest rate of 3.9%. Ant Group is offering an\ninterest margin of 88bp over SOFR/CNH Hibor for its latest US$5.5bn-equivalent\nthree-year refinancing, while Xiamen Xiangyu’s three-year borrowing carries\nmargins of 135bp over SOFR for commitments in US dollars, and 120bp over CNH\nHibor or 10bp over one-year LPR for commitments in offshore renminbi.\n\n“The pricing on these deals really comes down to the bargaining power of the\nborrowers,” the banker said. “Stronger borrowers are often able to dictate\nthe specific pricing benchmarks they want to use. Meanwhile, some other\nborrowers opt to structure their deals with multiple pricing options in order\nto access the widest pool of liquidity from different lenders.”\nQuota preservation\nDim Sum loans help borrowers manage foreign exchange risks while using up\ntheir offshore borrowing quotas, which Chinese regulators might not renew if\nthey are not used.\n\n“While onshore loans may offer lower pricing, borrowers consider other\nfactors such as the flexibility of raising offshore loans in terms of the use\nof proceeds for overseas projects, the importance of maintaining their\noffshore borrowing limits as well as relationships with overseas banks,”\nsaid CCB (Asia)'s Ng.\n\nFor lenders, offshore renminbi loans present opportunities to deploy capital\namid a dearth of deal flow in Hong Kong as well as intense competition from\nChina’s domestic loan market.\n\nOverall lending opportunities are on the decline as a prolonged debt crisis in\nChina’s real estate sector as well as a slower-than-expected economic\nrecovery has hurt demand for credit. US dollar fundraising activity for China\nInc in Hong Kong, traditionally the offshore funding centre for Chinese\nborrowers, plunged 37% year on year to US$10.16bn in the first half of 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, the liquidity pool for offshore renminbi in Hong Kong\nremains strong.

But does it change my long term view? Probably\nnot, there are a lot of structural issues, such as the\noverleveraged property sector.\"\n    While the CSI300 blue-chip index <.CSI300> and the Shanghai\nComposite Index <.SSEC> gained around 2% each, shares in Hong\nKong closed around 0.8% softer <.HSI>.\n    Property stocks, onshore and offshore, posted solid gains as\ninvestors bet the latest stimulus measures could aid China's\nbeleaguered property sector <.HSMPI> <.CSI000952>.\n    And the latest stimulus pledges prompted Goldman Sachs to\nraise its China real gross domestic product forecast for this\nyear to 4.9% from 4.7%.\n    But in a sign of the mixed response from investors, China's\noffshore yuan <CNH=D3> fell 0.3% to 7.0902 per dollar.\n    In addition, oil prices wiped out nearly all the gains made\nlast week after data showed China's inflation rate declined and\na lack of clarity on the country's economic stimulus plans\nstoked fears about fuel demand in the world's biggest crude\nimporter.\n    Brent crude futures fell $2 to $77.02 per barrel, while U.S.\nWest Texas Intermediate crude futures also fell $2, or 2.7%, to\n$73.52 per barrel.\n    In Europe, LVMH <LVMH.PA>, Hermes <HRMS.PA>, Kering\n<PRTP.PA> and other French luxury stocks exposed to China fell\nroughly between 2% and 4%.\n    \n    LACKING MOMENTUM\n    All this left MSCI's World Stock Index <.MIWD00000PUS> flat\non the day, below record highs hit last month.\n    French government bonds showed little immediate reaction to\nnews that credit ratings agency Fitch had revised France's\noutlook to \"negative\" from \"stable\" on Friday, citing increases\nin fiscal policy and political risks.\n    \"People are already negative on France, it's some positivity\nthat they are making an effort (on the deficit),\" said Kumar. \n    France's 10-year bond yield gap over benchmark Germany was\naround 77 basis points (bps), slightly tighter from Friday's\nclosing levels.\n    Germany's 10-year bond yield was steady on the day at 2.27%\n<DE10YT=RR>.\n    Currency markets, like government bonds, were largely\nsubdued.\n    The dollar drew support from reduced bets of a big Federal\nReserve interest rate cut next month <FEDWATCH>.\n    Against a basket of currencies, the greenback <=USD> was a\ntouch softer at 103.02, hovering near a recent seven-week high.\n    Traders have priced out any chance of a 50-basis-point rate\ncut from the Fed in November after data last week showed\nconsumer prices rose slightly more than expected in September\nand recent economic releases have also underscored strength in\nthe labour market. <FEDWATCH>\n    Sterling <GBP=D3> dipped 0.1% to $1.3054, with some focus in\nUK markets on an investment summit as the new Labour government\ntries to boost the country's long-term economic outlook.\n    The euro <EUR=EBS> eased just 0.08% to $1.0927 ahead of a\nlikely ECB rate cut on Thursday.\n    Konstantin Veit, a portfolio manager at PIMCO, said he\nexpected a quarter point rate cut to 3.25%. \n    Data signal a euro zone economy in worse shape than when\npolicymakers last met, boosting bets on speedier rate cuts than\nthe quarterly pace June and September reductions suggested.\n    \"While the ECB has previously been guiding towards the next\nrate cut in December, a weaker macroeconomic picture has likely\nstrengthened the Governing Council’s confidence enough to\ndeviate from the quarterly rate cut trajectory and make its\nfirst move outside a staff projection meeting,\" Veit said.\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates YTD    http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\nAsian stock markets    https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\nHang Seng Index    https://reut.rs/3Ykzh5J\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe and Alun John in London and Rae\nWee in Singapore; Editing by Christopher Cushing, Sharon\nSingleton and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)\n ((dhara.ranasinghe@thomsonreuters.com;))\n \n((To read Reuters Markets and Finance news, click on \nhttps://www.reuters.com/finance/markets\nFor the state of play of Asian stock markets please click on: <0#.INDEXA>))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

This\ntime President Xi Jinping is better prepared for a fight, even as he has more\nto lose.\n\nTrump, who won a second term as president in an election on Tuesday, has\nthreatened to put tariffs of as much as 60% on Chinese goods, a level that\nBloomberg Economics says will decimate trade between the world's biggest\neconomies. That's on top of a range of export controls on advanced technology\nthat the Biden administration has only tightened since Trump left office.\n\nDuring this period, China has taken strategic steps to ensure it's more\nresilient and well-positioned to strike back. Key to that has been expanding\nits toolkit, which now includes export controls on critical raw materials,\ntariffs on agricultural goods and an entity list that can target key American\ncompanies.\n\n\"China, psychologically speaking, is much more prepared in dealing with him\nagain,\" said Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the People's Liberation Army\nand senior fellow at Tsinghua University's Centre for International Security\nand Strategy. China's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday congratulated Trump on his\nelection victory, saying it respects the choice of Americans.\n\nStill, Xi would much prefer to avoid a tariff battle that risks proving much\nmore devastating than the first round. China has relied on exports of goods\nlike electric vehicles and batteries to buoy an economy beset by deflationary\npressure and property woes, and Chinese lawmakers are meeting this week to\nformulate measures to bolster growth.\n\nIf Trump follows through on his tariff threats, Chinese authorities will need\nto do much more to help the economy. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said last week\nthat steeper trade restrictions on China may force Xi's hand to bolster\ndomestic consumption, something the Communist Party has traditionally sought\nto avoid.\n\nThe yuan on Wednesday weakened the most in two years and Chinese stocks fell,\ngiving investors a taste of the volatility that lies ahead as Trump clinches\nthe US presidency. The offshore yuan fell as much as 1.3% against the dollar,\nthe largest one-day drop since October 2022. Chinese shares listed in Hong\nKong bore the brunt of the selling, with a Hang Seng gauge closing 2.6% lower.\n\n\"China can hardly retaliate on 60% tariffs,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, Asia\nPacific chief economist at Natixis SA. \"What China will do is to announce a\nbigger stimulus to counteract so that the market doesn't penalize China.\"\n\nDuring Trump's first term, roughly two years of threats, tariffs and talks\nended with a deal signed in January 2020 that included a promise by China to\nbuy $200 billion worth of American goods to try and close its trade imbalance\nwith the US. However, the outbreak of Covid around the same time quickly\nsoured relations between the countries, and China never came close to\nachieving the targets as Chinese exports soared during the pandemic.\n\nA renewed trade war threatens to do greater damage to global trade. Last year,\nChinese companies exported $500 billion in goods to the US, or about 15% of\nthe value of all its exports. If the US were to put high tariffs on all or\nmuch of those products, it could wipe out those sales and further hurt firms\nfacing a weak domestic economy and falling prices.\n\nWhile Chinese officials don't want to overreact to Trump's new tariff threats,\nthey are also wary of looking weak, according to Scott Kennedy, a senior\nadviser at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International\nStudies, who frequently travels to China. Potential options for Xi's\ngovernment, he said, include targeting American companies with sizable\ninterests in China, selling US treasuries, devaluing the yuan and doing more\noutreach in Europe and Latin America.\n\n\"They're sick of being treated like a piñata and want to fight back,\" Kennedy\nsaid of China. \"They're prepared to deal with Trump and fight fire with fire\nif needed.\"\n\nOne wild card for China is the emergence of Elon Musk as a major supporter of\nTrump's campaign for president. The billionaire chief executive officer of\nTesla Inc. has extensive business interests in China, raising the possibility\nthat he could advocate a softer approach. Trump praised Musk while declaring\nvictory in the early morning hours of Wednesday in the US.\n\nBut if a trade war does erupt, China will be ready to hit back - and US\nexports of agricultural goods may again be the first target. Since Trump's\nfirst term, Brazil has strengthened its position as the largest soybean\nsupplier to China, and is now also the biggest source of corn imports,\nreplacing the big spike of US exports to China as part of the 2020 trade deal.\nIn 2016, the US supplied more than 40% of Chinese soybean imports, but that\nhad fallen to less than 18% in the first nine months of this year.\n\nChina's slowing economy also provides Beijing with more of a buffer, as its\ndemand for pork - as well as corn and soybeans to feed pigs - has slumped.\nThat means it's less reliant on imports and can more easily shift purchases\nfrom the US to other nations.\n\n\"There should not be any doubt about China's tit-for-tat retaliation,\" said\nZhou Xiaoming, a researcher at a Beijing think-tank and a former deputy\nrepresentative to China's United Nations mission in Geneva a decade ago. \"Easy\ntargets include corn and soya beans. The country is in a better position than\n2018 to take counter measures as China has developed Brazil as a reliable\nalternative source of supplies and been able to reduce imports from the US.\"\n\nAt the same time, however, China has fewer obvious targets to hit. The\ncountry's imports from the US have fallen from a peak in 2021, and Beijing\nhasn't signed a contract to buy new Boeing Co. jets for years, meaning it has\none less threat it can make. In addition to a weakening trade relationship,\ndirect investment ties between the US and China are also shrinking: The stock\nof Chinese investment in the US last year was down by 28% from the peak in\n2019, according to United Nations data.\n\nThat raises the possibility that China may seek to devalue its currency,\nmaking exports cheaper. While China's last formal devaluation was in 2015,\nduring the thick of the first trade spat from mid-2018 to mid-2019 authorities\nallowed the yuan to fall to almost 7.2 to the dollar, making its exports\ncheaper and providing some cushion to Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe Chinese currency is currently around the same level, but allowing it to\ndrop a lot further risks irking other trading partners around the world, who\nmight in turn put their own tariffs on Chinese goods. A flood of cheap steel\nhas already prompted nations to raise barriers to the metal, and that could\nspread to more products in a general trade war.\n\nOne major new tool for Xi is export controls, which the US has deployed\nfrequently against China. Last year, Beijing restricted overseas sales of\ngallium and germanium, two metals which are widely used across chipmaking,\ncommunications equipment and defense industries. China may now seek to impose\ncurbs on critical raw materials the US needs for strategic technologies, such\nas antimony, which is used in some semiconductor devices.\n\nChina also now has a more formal process for sanctioning foreign firms.\nAuthorities in September said China would begin a probe of PVH Corp., the\nparent company of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, for not using cotton from\nthe far west region of Xinjiang, where the US restricted trade due to human\nrights concerns. Beijing has also sanctioned a US drone firm for supplying\nTaiwan, blocking it from purchasing parts in China, according to the Financial\nTimes.\n\nUltimately, China would prefer to strike a deal with Trump. The incoming\npresident has signaled that he would be open to Chinese investment in the US,\nwhich could potentially form the basis for some sort of agreement, according\nto Henry Wang Huiyao, founder of the Center for China and Globalization\nresearch group in Beijing.\n\n\"Trump is a pragmatic politician who focuses on solving specific problems,\"\nWang said. \"China has the super lead on electric vehicles and green\ntechnology,\" he added. \"There's an enormous opportunity that Chinese companies\ncan help make America great again.\"\n\nStill, there's a recognition in Beijing that China must hope for the best and\nprepare for the worst. And there's not a whole lot of options if Trump wants\nto make good on extreme threats that would also hurt the US and raise prices\nfor American consumers.\n\n\"We've talked a lot about what China can do to prepare for this scenario, but\nin the end there isn't really too much that can be prepared,\" said Tu Xinquan,\na former adviser to China's Commerce Ministry who is now professor and dean of\nthe China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International\nBusiness and Economics in Beijing.\n\n\"There's no silver bullet,\" he added. \"We can only deal with the problem when\nit comes.\" Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.\nFor any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement,\nplease contact Editor at contentservices@htdigital.in"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "China and Japan are dumping US TreasuriesNov 26, 2024\n\nChina and Japan are ditching US Treasuries like never before. In the third quarter of 2024, Japan sold a staggering $61.9 billion of US government debt—the biggest quarterly sale on record.\n\nThis came right after they offloaded $40.5 billion in the second quarter. Not to be left out, China dumped $51.3 billion in the same period, its second-largest reduction in history.\n\nFor China, this is the continuation of a trend. The country has reduced its Treasury holdings in six out of the last seven quarters.\n\nEven more shocking, their total holdings have now dropped below $800 billion, a level not seen in 16 years. What’s driving this dramatic pullback by two of the world’s largest foreign creditors?\n\nChina’s Treasury dump tied to yuan defense\n\nChina’s aggressive Treasury sell-off is closely linked to its strategy to protect the yuan. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has been on high alert ever since Donald Trump’s election victory, which came with renewed threats of tariffs.\n\nThe PBOC has been setting its daily reference rate stronger than 7.2 yuan per dollar, signaling its determination to support the currency despite market pressures.\n\nOn Tuesday, the central bank set the fixing at a one-week high, defying expectations that it might cave to market forces. Trump, now president-elect, has already vowed to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, accusing Beijing of failing to fight fentanyl trafficking.\n\n“Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% tariff,” Trump posted on Truth Social. Unsurprisingly, the offshore yuan dropped, trading around 7.26 against the dollar.\n\nThis isn’t the first time China has faced this kind of tug-of-war. Back in 2015, the PBOC allowed the yuan to weaken significantly, leading to capital outflows that shook the country’s financial stability. Memories of that period seem to be driving today’s cautious approach.\n\nBut traders aren’t convinced that the PBOC can hold its ground. Historically, Beijing has drawn “red lines” for the yuan, only to retreat under market pressure. In 2019, for instance, the currency slipped past 6.9 per dollar and later breached 7, its weakest point since the global financial crisis.\n\nThe stakes are higher this time. China is balancing its need to defend the yuan with its goal of reigniting economic growth. A stronger currency can stabilize investor confidence but risks stalling exports, a critical driver of the economy.\n\nJapan’s sales linked to domestic pressures\n\nJapan’s record-breaking sale of US Treasuries, on the other hand, seems more tied to domestic needs. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba recently unveiled a ¥39 trillion ($250 billion) stimulus package to help Japanese households and businesses cope with rising costs.\n\nIshiba emphasized the urgency of raising wages across all generations, saying, “This needs to happen now and in the future.”\n\nTo fund these measures, Japan is clearly pulling back on its investments in US debt. The ¥13.9 trillion cost of the package reflects the government’s focus on domestic stability.\n\nJapan’s ruling coalition, now a minority in parliament, has had to make deals with smaller parties to get the stimulus plan approved. While the country sold a record $61.9 billion in Q3, this follows another massive reduction in Q2.\n\nTrump’s first trade threats shake markets\n\nTrump has made his first trade war threats, and markets are already feeling the heat. He’s promising a 10% tariff on Chinese goods and a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada. The news has hit currencies hard.\n\nThe Canadian dollar just dropped to a four-year low, and the Mexican peso is at its weakest since 2022. “Drugs are pouring into our country, mostly through Mexico, at levels never seen before,” he posted. He also said he’ll sign an executive order for these tariffs on day one of his presidency.\n\nMarkets reacted fast. The offshore yuan slipped as traders doubted China’s ability to keep its currency stable. Trump’s tough talk comes days after naming Scott Bessent as the next Treasury Secretary.\n\nSome thought Bessent’s appointment might mean a softer approach, but Trump’s latest moves show he’s not budging from his hardline trade stance.\n\nThe sell-offs from China and Japan raise some serious questions. What happens to US debt markets now? How does this change the global financial balance of power? One thing’s for sure—China and Japan aren’t playing the same game they used to.\n\nLand a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

The comprehensive package\nannounced Tuesday could quell negative sentiment that China won't do enough to\nrevive the economy.\n    Additionally, the PBOC expects existing mortgage rates to be lowered by\nabout 50 bps, reducing household interest payments by approximately 150 billion\nyuan. Down-payments for second homes will be reduced to 15% and unified with\nthose for first homes. \n    In a third wave of stimulus announcements, aimed at the stock market, the\nsecurities regulator said it will encourage medium and long-term funds to enter\nthe market, while promoting mergers and acquisitions.

The central bank's\ndaily benchmark fixings and support from state-owned banks have\nslowed its decline. \n    The currency hit a five-month low of 7.2422 on Tuesday, and\nis down roughly 2% this year, pressured by its relative low\nyields versus other currencies and outflows of foreign\ninvestment from an anaemic stock market. \n    Top U.S. central bank officials including Powell backed away\non Tuesday from providing any guidance on when interest rates\nmay be cut, saying instead that monetary policy needs to be\nrestrictive for longer.

Title: Technical Analysis: Wuxi Unicomp's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into Wuxi Unicomp Technology Co Ltd (WUXI) may be scratching their heads after the latest lack of news from the company. Despite this silence, we can still analyze the company's performance based on its historical data. Let's dive into our technical analysis to see what signals Wuxi Unicomp is sending. Price Performance: A Rollercoaster Ride Over the past year, Wuxi Unicomp has experienced a wild ride in terms of stock price fluctuations. From a 52-week high of 139.29 CNY on September 6th, 2023, the stock plummeted to a low of 37.1 CNY on July 24th, 2024 - a whopping 76% drop. However, since then, the stock has recovered slightly, with its last closing price sitting at 38.44 CNY as of August 25th, 2024. This rollercoaster ride has left investors wondering whether the company's fundamentals have changed or if the market simply overreacted to certain events. Valuation Metrics: P/E Ratio & P/B Ratio When examining Wuxi Unicomp's valuation metrics, we find that the company's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 31.7617, which is significantly higher than the industry average of 22.64. This suggests that investors are expecting strong future growth from the company, given its relatively high P/E ratio compared to peers. On the other hand, the company's Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 1.34177 indicates that the market values Wuxi Unicomp's assets at a premium, implying that investors believe the company's book value will increase in the future. Technical Indicators: Support & Resistance Levels Looking at Wuxi Unicomp's chart, we notice several key levels of support and resistance that could impact the stock's near-term performance. Firstly, the 50-day Moving Average (MA) currently sits at 35.67 CNY, representing a significant level of support for the stock. If the stock price falls below this threshold, it could trigger further selling pressure and potentially push the stock down towards its next level of support around 30 CNY. Conversely, if the stock manages to break above its 52-week high of 139.29 CNY, it could face resistance at the 200-day MA, currently hovering around 120 CNY. Conclusion: Mixed Signals Abound Our technical analysis of Wuxi Unicomp reveals mixed signals regarding the company's future prospects. While the stock's recent recovery from its summer lows is encouraging, its high P/E ratio and premium P/B ratio suggest that investors expect robust growth from the company. Additionally, the stock's support and resistance levels could influence its short-term performance. In light of these factors, investors should exercise caution when making decisions about Wuxi Unicomp, and closely monitor upcoming developments before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Guizhou Zhenhua E-chem (688707.SS) traded up 1.86 % and now trades at CNY 8.57.

However, we can analyze the company's performance based on its historical data. Last Quarterly Results ------------------ According to the latest available data from Finanzen.net, NBMG presented its quarterly results on August 27th, with a closing price of 9.24 CNH. This marks a significant increase from its 52-week low of 8.93 CNH on August 12th, indicating a positive trend for the company. Price Performance --------------- Over the past year, NBMG has experienced a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs. Its 52-week high of 22.88 CNH was reached on October 18th, 2023, followed by a sharp decline to its lowest point of 8.93 CNH on August 12th, 2024. As of September 9th, the stock has slightly recovered to close at 9.24 CNH. Key Ratios ----------- * Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 16.4 * Price to Book Ratio (P/B): 0.63369 These ratios suggest that NBMG is currently undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. With a P/E ratio of 16.4, investors may be hesitant to buy into the company due to concerns about its profitability. However, its P/B ratio of 0.63369 indicates that the company's assets are being undervalued, which could present an opportunity for savvy investors. Technical Outlook ---------------- Looking at the technical side of things, NBMG's chart pattern suggests a possible bullish reversal. After hitting its 52-week low on August 12th, the stock has been steadily increasing, with a slight pullback on August 27th. If this upward trend continues, NBMG could potentially reach its next resistance level around 12.50 CNH. However, it's important to note that the stock's volatility remains high, with a relative strength index (RSI) of 56.67, indicating that it may be overbought. Investors should exercise caution and monitor the stock's performance closely before making any investment decisions. In conclusion, while there have been no recent updates on Ningxia Building Materials Group Co Ltd, a technical analysis of the company's historical data reveals a mixed picture. While the company's fundamentals suggest undervaluation, its high volatility and uncertain market conditions make it a risky investment. Therefore, investors should approach with caution and carefully consider their risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Shenzhen Newway Photomask Making\n\nThe Shenzhen Newway Photomask Making Co Ltd is a Chinese company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

Current market capitalisation for Will Semiconductor Shanghai is CNY 138.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Will Semiconductor Shanghai is 53.28.\n\n- Wuxi Apptec (2359.HK) traded down -0.62 % and now trades at HKD 57.3. Wuxi Apptec has a market capitalisation of HKD 163.3 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Wuxi Apptec is 18.86. Title: WuXi AppTec's Share Price Falls Below Key Level Investors have been keeping a close eye on WuXi AppTec Co Ltd (HKG: 54), a leading global pharmaceutical and biotechnology R&D outsourcing platform, as its share price has recently dipped below a key level. As of yesterday's market close, the stock finished at 54 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), down from its previous close of 60 HKD. This represents a decline of over 10% in just one week. According to our technical analysis, this drop has pushed the stock below its 50-day moving average, which had previously served as strong support for the shares. This could be a cause for concern for investors who were hoping for a rebound in the near term. However, the stock still trades above its longer-term 200-day moving average, which suggests that the underlying fundamentals remain strong. Looking back at the company's historical performance, we can see that WuXi AppTec has experienced significant volatility over the past year. In July 2023, the stock reached a 52-week high of 99.55 HKD before pulling back to a low of 27.5 HKD in November 2023. Since then, the shares have been trading in a range between these two levels, with the current price sitting around the midpoint of this range. One positive aspect of WuXi AppTec's current situation is its attractive valuation. Based on its trailing twelve-month P/E ratio of 17.75 and its P/B ratio of 2.64654, the stock appears to be undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. This could make it an appealing option for value investors looking for a bargain in the sector. However, it's important to note that the company's most recent financial results did not meet expectations, which may have contributed to the recent sell-off. Investors will be watching closely to see if WuXi AppTec can turn things around in the coming quarters. With the company's solid track record and promising pipeline, there is certainly potential for upside in the long run. But for now, caution may be warranted until further clarity emerges regarding the company's future prospects.\n\n- Shanghai Port (600018.SS) traded down -0.5 % and now trades at CNY 5.96. Current market capitalisation for Shanghai Port is CNY 139.9 bn. Shanghai Port has a current price to earnings ratio of 10.17. Shanghai Port: A Green Shipping Corridor Pioneer? In an effort to promote sustainable practices in the maritime industry, Shanghai Port has joined forces with Germany's Port of Hamburg to build a green shipping corridor. This collaboration comes on the heels of Shanghai Port's impressive performance in recent months, with the stock closing at 6.05 CNY on October 25th, just shy of its 52-week high of 7.15 CNY reached on October 7th. A Technical Analysis Perspective From a technical standpoint, Shanghai Port's current price of 6.05 CNY represents a significant increase compared to its 52-week low of 4.87 CNY recorded on November 19th, 2023. This upward trend suggests that investors have been bullish on the company's prospects, particularly given its efforts towards creating a greener shipping corridor. Moreover, the stock's Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.29 and Price to Book (P/B) ratio of 1.06738 indicate a relatively expensive valuation, which may be warranted by the company's promising outlook. However, it is worth noting that Shanghai Port's stock has experienced some volatility in the past, with fluctuations potentially influenced by factors such as global economic conditions, trade policies, and geopolitical tensions. As such, investors should exercise caution when considering investment opportunities in this asset. Conclusion Shanghai Port's partnership with the Port of Hamburg highlights the company's commitment to sustainability and innovation in the maritime industry. From a technical perspective, the stock's recent performance and valuation ratios suggest a positive outlook, but investors should remain vigilant and monitor potential risks and market developments before making any investment decisions.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Dawning Information Industry\n\nDawning Information Industry Co., Ltd is a Chinese company that specializes in information technology.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Ningbo Xusheng trades 5.58 percent higher on Friday 20th of SeptemberSep 20, 2024\n\nNingbo Xusheng (603305.SS) traded up 5.58 % during a 24 hours period ending at 09:52 AM Central Europe on Friday 20th. One Ningbo Xusheng stock can currently be bought for about CNH 8.8 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Ningbo Xusheng stocks is 933.2 mn. Ningbo Xusheng has a current market capitalization of CNH 8.2 bn and approximately CNH 123.6 mn worth of Ningbo Xusheng was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Ningbo Xusheng has traded 0.11 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 13.55. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 24.04 on 09/25/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 8.3 on 09/18/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Ningbo Xusheng\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: Ningbo Xusheng's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Chinese automotive technology firm Ningbo Xusheng may be scratching their heads after reviewing the company's latest financial reports and market trends. Despite showing promise with its 52-week high of 24.04 CNH (Chinese Yuan) recorded on September 24th, 2023, the stock has experienced a significant downturn in recent months, with its current price standing at 8.43 CNH as of yesterday's closing bell. A closer look at Ningbo Xusheng's historical price movements reveals a pattern of fluctuations that have left analysts divided. The company's 52-week range has been quite volatile, spanning from a low of 8.3 CNH on September 17th, 2024, to a high of 24.04 CNH on September 24th, 2023. This wide range reflects the challenges faced by the auto industry as a whole, as well as the company's efforts to navigate these turbulent waters. One positive indicator for Ningbo Xusheng is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio), which stands at 13.88. This suggests that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of the company's earnings, indicating confidence in its long-term growth prospects. However, the company's Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 1.26 indicates that the stock may be overvalued compared to its peers, given its relatively modest book value. Technically speaking, Ningbo Xusheng's current price position appears to be testing the lower boundary of its Bollinger Bands, a chart pattern that measures volatility and helps identify potential breakouts or reversals. If the stock can manage to hold above this level, it could signal a bullish reversal and potentially lead to a rebound towards its 52-week high. Conversely, a breach below this support could send the stock tumbling further downwards. In conclusion, while Ningbo Xusheng's mixed signals make it difficult to predict its short-term trajectory, the company's fundamentals and technical indicators suggest that there may be opportunities for savvy investors who are willing to take a contrarian approach. As always, thorough research and risk assessment are essential before making any investment decisions.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Mabwell Shanghai Bioscience (688062.SS) traded down -0.28 % and now trades at CNY 20.41. Mabwell Shanghai Bioscience has a market capitalisation of CNY 9.6 bn.\n\n- Ningbo Haitian Precision Machinery (601882.SS) traded up 2.48 % and now trades at CNH 18.78. Current market capitalisation for Ningbo Haitian Precision Machinery is CNH 9.8 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Ningbo Haitian Precision Machinery is 16.76. Title: Technical Analysis: Ningbo Haitian Precision Machinery's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into Ningbo Haitian Precision Machinery Co Ltd (NHPM) may be scratching their heads after the latest data release. Despite showing promising numbers in the previous quarter, the stock has been experiencing mixed signals in terms of performance. In this technical analysis, we will delve into the current and past prices of NHPM to provide a comprehensive outlook. Current Price: 18.53 CNH As of September 18th, 2024, NHPM's current price stands at 18.53 CNH, down from its 52-week high of 30.98 CNH recorded on September 26th, 2023. This represents a significant drop of 42.6% from its peak value. However, the stock has shown resilience in recent months, with a slight increase of 2.4% over the past week. Past Performance: A Rollercoaster Ride Looking back at NHPM's performance over the past year, investors have experienced a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs. After reaching an all-time high of 30.98 CNH in September 2023, the stock plummeted to a low of 18.52 CNH on September 9th, 2024 - a whopping 42.6% decrease. However, the stock has since recovered slightly, with a gain of 2.4% over the past week. Key Metrics: P/E Ratio & P/B Ratio At a P/E ratio of 16.76, NHPM's valuation remains attractive compared to its industry peers. Additionally, the P/B ratio of 3.95 indicates that the stock is undervalued based on its book value. These metrics suggest that the stock could potentially see an uptick in the future, especially given its strong fundamentals. Technical Outlook: Mixed Signals From a technical standpoint, NHPM's chart paints a mixed picture. The stock has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, which can indicate either a bullish or bearish breakout. If the stock breaks above the upper trend line, it could signal a potential upswing towards 22.85 CNH, representing a 20% increase from its current price. Conversely, a break below the lower trend line could lead to a decline towards 16.37 CNH, a 12.5% decrease. Conclusion While NHPM's recent performance has been unpredictable, the stock's strong fundamentals and undervalued status make it an intriguing opportunity for long-term investors. However, short-term traders may want to exercise caution due to the mixed technical signals. As always, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Shanghai Foreign Service (600662.SS) traded up 3.87 % and now trades at CNH 3.99.

Title: Technical Analysis: China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Development Group Co Ltd (CSSP) In this article, we will provide a comprehensive technical analysis of China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Development Group Co Ltd (CSSP), based solely on the information available up until September 19th, 2024. CSSP has been relatively quiet in recent times, with no significant news or events impacting its performance. However, by examining its historical price data, we can identify some interesting trends and patterns that may be worth considering for investors. CSSP's stock has experienced a mixed bag of performances over the past year, with both highs and lows. Its 52-week high was reached on May 21st, 2024, at $9.32 CNH, while its 52-week low was hit on September 17th, 2024, at $6.29 CNH. As of today's closing price, CSSP is trading at $6.43 CNH, representing a decrease of approximately 31% from its peak and an increase of around 6% from its trough. Trend Lines: CSSP's price chart reveals several notable trend lines that could potentially influence future price movements. Firstly, there is a clear uptrend line that stretches back to early June 2024, indicating steady growth during that period. This uptrend line has been tested multiple times, but so far, it has held strong, suggesting that buyers remain interested in the stock despite recent declines. Another important trend line is the downtrend line that formed after CSSP's peak in late May 2024. This downtrend line has been persistent, with each attempt to break above it being met with selling pressure. However, the line has started to flatten out recently, which could signal a potential reversal in the near future. Support & Resistance: CSSP's support and resistance levels offer valuable insights into where the stock might find buyers and sellers. Based on its historical price action, the following levels have been identified: * Support: $6.29 CNH (52-week low), $6.43 CNH (current price), $6.67 CNH (200-day moving average) * Resistance: $7.00 CNH (20-day moving average), $7.33 CNH (50-day moving average), $8.00 CNH (200-day moving average) Technical Indicators: CSSP's technical indicators suggest a neutral stance for now, with neither bullish nor bearish signals dominating the landscape. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently sitting at 48.17, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a small positive divergence, hinting at possible upside momentum in the short term. Conclusion: While CSSP has faced some turbulence in recent months, its historical price data suggests that the stock remains attractive to long-term investors. The uptrend line and the flattening downtrend line indicate that buyers continue to show interest in the stock, even during periods of volatility. Additionally, the neutral stance of CSSP's technical indicators implies that any potential gains are likely to be gradual rather than explosive. Therefore, investors looking for a stable yet potentially rewarding investment opportunity may want to consider adding CSSP to their watchlists.\n\n- Chongqing Genrix Biopharmaceutical (688443.SS) traded down -2.42 % and now trades at CNY 22.26.

The muted market reaction suggests that the rate cuts were largely anticipated.\n\nChina’s top policymakers had earlier emphasized the importance of revitalizing the property market, which plays a crucial role in the country’s economy.\n\nIn a Politburo meeting held in September, officials vowed to implement substantial interest rate reductions and introduce measures to prevent further deterioration in the real estate sector.\n\nBruce Pang, chief economist for Greater China at Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., noted that the larger-than-expected cuts signal the government’s determination to stabilize the housing market.\n\nFurther easing measures likely\n\nThe PBOC has indicated that additional monetary easing could be on the horizon.\n\nGovernor Pan Gongsheng hinted at the possibility of another reduction in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 25 to 50 basis points by year-end to increase bank lending capacity.\n\nThough further interest rate cuts are not expected this year, analysts believe the PBOC could act more aggressively if unexpected economic shocks arise.\n\nChina’s largest state-owned lenders also reduced their deposit rates last week, a move intended to mitigate the impact of lower loan rates on bank profit margins.\n\nA pivotal moment for China’s economy\n\nThe recent rate cuts mark another step in China’s effort to navigate a challenging economic landscape. As the property market faces headwinds and consumer sentiment remains fragile, the government hopes these measures will reinvigorate borrowing and spending.\n\nWhile the PBOC’s actions aim to maintain stability in financial markets, economists caution that their effectiveness will depend on consumer and investor confidence.\n\nWith additional policy tools at its disposal, the central bank may have to balance further easing with long-term financial stability.\n\nThe post China cuts lending rates to revive economy and stabilize housing market appeared first on Invezz"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

The\nunemployment rate was forecast to rise to 4.2%.\n    Markets now see about a 72% chance that the Federal Reserve\nwill deliver a 25-basis-point rate cut when it convenes on Dec.\n17-18, up from 66.5% a week ago, CME's FedWatch tool showed.\n    City Index's Cincotta said this week's indicators, including\nprivate payrolls, jobless claims and services sector activity,\npointed to on-target payrolls. \n        \"If we see an on-target non-farm payroll report, then I\nthink that will support confirmation that the Federal Reserve\nwill be cutting interest rates in the December meeting.\" \n  \n        A stronger report could instead turn the attention to\nnext week's U.S. inflation data, Cincotta added. \n  \n    The dollar also briefly spiked against South Korea's won\n<KRW=> after local media reported the nation's main opposition\nDemocratic Party saying lawmakers were on standby after\nreceiving reports of another martial law declaration.\n    The won weakened, leaving the dollar up 0.42% at 1419.27.\n    The political upheaval has kept Korean markets on\ntenterhooks even as authorities pledged to provide \"unlimited\nliquidity\" to stabilise conditions.  \n    Elsewhere, China's yuan was little changed against the\ndollar but headed for its 10th straight weekly loss amid\nconcerns that new tariffs threatened by U.S. President-elect\nDonald Trump will heighten strains on the struggling Chinese\neconomy, and whether Beijing will ease its grip on the currency\nto support exports.\n    The offshore yuan traded about flat at 7.2632 <CNH=D3>.\n    In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin <BTC=> took a breather after \ncatapulting above $100,000 for the first time a day earlier.\n    It briefly slid to a one-week low and was last down 0.82% at\n$98,170, well off Thursday's peak of $103,649.\n    Trump said on Thursday he was appointing former PayPal\n<PYPL.O> Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his artificial\nintelligence and cryptocurrency czar.\n    The dollar was up 0.32% against the yen <JPY=EBS> at 150.55\nas traders pondered the likelihood of a December rate hike in\nJapan.\n    The Australian dollar fetched $0.64285 <AUD=D3>, down 0.37%,\nand New Zealand's kiwi slid 0.52% to trade at $0.5854 <NZD=D3>. \n    \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates    https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Brigid Riley and Greta Rosen Fondahn; editing by\nShri Navaratnam, Kim Coghill and Mark Heinrich)\n ((brigid.riley@thomsonreuters.com;))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

Outlook Despite the lack of recent news, Kingnet Network's share price has remained resilient due to its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. Investors may view the stock as a solid long-term investment opportunity, given its undervalued status and potential for future growth. However, any significant changes in the company's financial performance or industry landscape could impact the stock's trajectory moving forward.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Levima Advanced Materials\n\nLevima Advanced Materials Corporation is a research-oriented company that specializes in the development, production, and distribution of advanced materials.

Activity in SGX Group's marketplaces increased across asset classes as global investors managed portfolio risks in response to manifold economic and political developments during a volatile month. Derivatives traded volume gained 15% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 23.5 million contracts.\n\nTowards the end of July, SGX Group's Japan-access derivatives suite enabled market participants to manage risk around Japan's monetary policy decisions. As the Bank of Japan (BOJ) raised its benchmark interest rate and announced plans to slow its monthly bond purchases, the volume of SGX three-month Tokyo Overnight Average (TONA) Futures topped 532 lots following the contract's debut on 29 July, while month-end open interest (OI) in SGX Mini Japanese Government Bond (JGB) Futures rose 21% month-on-month (m-o-m). In addition, the pioneering SGX Nikkei 225 Index Futures saw 52,504 lots (US$6.8 billion notional) traded on 31 July – up 36% over the daily average for the month.\n\nKey highlights:\n\n* Record FX futures volume: total futures traded volume on SGX FX climbed 44% y-o-y in July to 4.8 million contracts, an all-time high. Gains were led by SGX USD/CNH FX Futures – the world's most widely traded international renminbi futures – with volume up 40% y-o-y at a record 2.9 million contracts, while SGX INR/USD FX Futures volume increased 48% y-o-y to 1.6 million contracts. Anticipation of rate decisions by the BOJ and the Federal Reserve, as well as uncertainties over the U.S. presidential elections, fuelled volatility and bolstered portfolio hedging.\n\n* New interest-rate hedging tools with focus on central banks: SGX Fixed Income launched three-month TONA and Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA) Futures on 29 July, as investors seek more accessible and cost-effective tools to hedge and trade fluctuations in interest rates. The contracts build upon SGX's offering of long-term interest rate futures comprising 10-year Full-Sized and Mini JGB futures.\n\n* Broad-based commodities gains, with record dairy OI: Commodity derivatives traded volume rose 20% y-o-y in July to 5.1 million contracts, with bellwether iron ore derivatives volume up 22% y-o-y on elevated risk management amid diverse views on China's growth outlook. Over the first seven months of 2024, 13.3 million metric tonnes (MT) of petrochemicals derivatives have traded on SGX Commodities, close to the 13.4 million MT cleared in all of 2023. Dairy derivatives OI set a single-day record of 171,335 lots on 16 July, rounding off the month with a record average of 106,386 lots.\n\n* Highest SIMSCI OI notional value in more than four years: OI in SGX MSCI Singapore Index Futures rose 42% y-o-y in July to 221,551 lots, with notional value surpassing US$5 billion for the first time since January 2020 amid strong buyside interest in safe-haven markets. SGX FTSE Taiwan Index Futures volume gained 15% y-o-y, as overnight volumes climbed to a peak of 53,029 lots (US$4.1 billion notional) on 18 July following the release of chipmaker TSMC's earnings. On SGX Equity Derivatives, total equity index futures volume increased 5% y-o-y to 13.1 million contracts.\n\n* SDAV growth leads region: Securities daily average value (SDAV) rose 13% y-o-y and 4% m-o-m in July to S$1.2 billion against declines across Southeast Asia, with higher retail activity across stock segments. The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) advanced 3.7% m-o-m to 3,455.94, also outpacing peers across ASEAN and Developed Asia, with year-to-date returns of 6.7%. During the month, Singapore's stock market remained the second most-actively traded in Southeast Asia. Total securities market turnover value increased 23% y-o-y and 26% m-o-m to S$26.5 billion.\n\n* Record REIT ETF turnover: The market turnover value of exchange-traded funds (ETF) jumped 48% m-o-m in July to S$404 million. For real-estate investment trust (REIT) ETFs, active participation from retail and robo-advisors lifted trading to a record S$131 million. Turnover of daily leverage certificates (DLC) surged 36% m-o-m to S$219 million, with Singapore-underlying DLCs showing the most increases.\n\n* Mainboard listing: SGX Securities welcomed the secondary listing of Helens International Holdings Company Limited on Mainboard on 19 July. The company runs one of the largest bar chain networks in the PRC.\n\nSource: Singapore Exchange\n\n[Category: Technology Hardware, Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals, New Offerings]\n\nCopyright 2017 Contify.com"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "(Updates throughout; refreshes prices at 0940 GMT)\n    By Amanda Cooper\n       LONDON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The dollar held near\nfour-month highs on Thursday, having scored its biggest one-day\nrally in two years following Donald Trump's win in the U.S.\npresidential election, and as investors prepped for several\ncentral bank decisions including the Federal Reserve.\n    Sterling rallied ahead of a Bank of England meeting, while\nthe Swedish and Norwegian crowns edged up after in-line\ndecisions from their respective central banks.\n    Front and centre, however, was the dollar, which rose by as\nmuch as 2% at one point against a basket of currencies on\nWednesday <=USD>, as investors piled into U.S. assets that they\nexpect would benefit from Trump's proposed policies on tariffs\nand taxes.\n    Trump's win is unlikely to make any immediate difference to\nthe Fed, which is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis\npoints later in the day. So investors will start to look to who\nTrump's key appointees might be, as well as whether or not his\nRepublican party wins both chambers of Congress in a \"Red\nsweep\", which could dictate how easily he may enact some of his\nproposals.\n    \"If there is, then we will probably, in the market\ncollectively, conclude he will get more of his fiscal agenda\nthrough. And that could be dollar-supportive,\" Rabobank currency\nstrategist Jane Foley said.\n    \"There is going to be a lot of back and forth to try and\nwork out exactly what is the inflation impact of this going to\nbe, and therefore, how is the Fed going to react? But, generally\nspeaking, I think all of that is certainly dollar-positive\nthrough 2025,\" she said.\n    More immediately, traders will want the Fed to indicate what\nto expect in December and beyond, particularly after last week's\nOctober jobs report, which was well below expectations, due in\nlarge part to disruption from recent hurricanes and labour\nstrikes.\n    Trump's victory has also fuelled speculation the Fed might\nreduce rates at a slower and shallower pace, as his policies on\nrestricting illegal immigration and enacting new tariffs could\nboost inflation.\n    Markets now see about a 67% chance the Fed will also cut\nrates next month, down from 77% on Tuesday, according to the CME\nGroup's Fed Watch Tool.\n    The dollar index <=USD>, which measures the U.S. currency\nagainst six others, was down 0.3% at 104.84 after surging to its\nhighest since July 3 on Wednesday, when it logged its biggest\nsingle-day gain since September 2022, up 1.5%.\n    \n    GERMAN CRISIS\n    The euro <EUR=EBS> rose 0.3% to $1.0758, having tumbled as\nlow as $1.068275 for the first time since July 27 on Wednesday.\n    The single European currency shrugged off political crisis\nin Germany, where the already awkward coalition led by\nChancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed late on Wednesday. \n    \"This puts into stark relief the challenge for the European\neconomy faced by a looming trade war and weak domestic demand,\"\nING strategist Chris Turner said.\n    Elsewhere in Europe, sterling <GBP=D3> rose 0.3% to $1.2919\nahead of the rate decision from the BoE, which is likely to cut\ninterest rates for the second time since 2020.\n    The big question for investors is what it signals about the\noutlook after the government's inflation-raising budget.\n    Sweden's Riksbank cut rates by half a point, as expected,\nleaving the crown up 0.1% against the euro at 11.632\n<EURSEK=D3>, while the Norges Bank left Norwegian rates\nunchanged, pushing the crown up 0.7% against the euro\n<EURNOK=D3>.\n    The yen hit a three-month low against the dollar of 154.715.\nJapan's top currency diplomat Atsushi Mimura flagged officials'\nreadiness to act, marking the government's strongest warning to\nspeculators in recent months.\n    The Japanese currency was last up 0.4% at 153.95 <JPY=EBS>.\n    The yuan rose 0.5% to after China's exports blew past\nforecasts, having earlier touched lowest in nearly three-months.\n    Offshore yuan traded at 7.1713 yuan per dollar <CNH=D3>.\n    Bitcoin <BTC=> fell 1.2% to $75,025, having hit a record\nhigh on Wednesday of $76,499.99.

While repeating their commitment to implementing policy\nchanges to shore up the economy, the NDRC dropped some crumbs for the market,\nindicating a partial front-loading of next year's government expenditures to\nboost Q4 economic activity. \n    The market was looking for affirmation of planned fiscal expansion. Yet that\ndecision isn't within the NDRC's remit. The onus falls upon the Ministry of\nFinance, but the actual size of expected special bond issuance to fund China's\nstimulus may not be revealed until after the National People's Congress Standing\nCommittee meeting in late October.\n    Until then, stocks might gyrate a bit more as investors seek an equilibrium\nbetween relative undervaluation and feverish FOMO.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Oct 15 (Reuters) - When comparing FX option volatility risk premiums\nwith their fair value measures for expiry dates, which include the U.S. election\non November 5, USD/JPY stands out as being potentially under-priced.\n    FX volatility is a key, yet unknown parameter of an FX option premium, so\ndealers use implied volatility as a stand in. If actual volatility matches\nimplied volatility over the life of that option it should cover the premium,\nwith the disparity potentially making FX volatility a tradable asset. Implied\nvolatility therefore represents the expected realised volatility and should\ndemand an additional premium if its expiry includes a high volatility risk\nevent, such as an election.\n    Historic volatility is actual/realised volatility over a particular time\nframe in the past and can provide a fair value measure upon which to gauge\nimplied volatility.\n    USD-related implied volatility for benchmark 1-month options saw a\nsignificant increase when its expiry included the US election result. In the\nmajority of cases implied volatility remains elevated and trades with a strong\npremium to 1-month historic volatility to highlight that \"event risk\" premium --\nbut not USD/JPY.\n    One-month USD/JPY implied volatility increased from 12.5 to 13.75 when its\nexpiry initially captured the U.S. election, but has retreated to 11.8 since.\nMid-September and two-month lows aren't far away at 11.3, while that fair value\none-month historic volatility measure remains elevated around 12.8.\n    One-month expiry also includes the next monthly U.S. jobs report and U.S.\npolicy decision - both of which would historically have increased realised\nUSD/JPY volatility.

Meanwhile,\ninflation has also edged higher. \n    Combine this with Q3 GDP tracking at over 3% – according to\nthe Atlanta Fed GDPNow model – and markets have naturally priced\nout Fed cuts, making it hard to look away from the dollar. \n    Consequently, across FX there appears to be a shortage\ndollar alternatives as the ECB have begun to lower rates at a\nfaster pace in response to a gloomier economic outlook. Election\nhedges have put a dent in the Chinese yuan’s recent advance and\neven this year’s outperformer, sterling, is potentially\nvulnerable to a deeper retracement with traders poorly\npositioned for the BoE stepping up the pace of rate cuts. \n    Thus, in the lead up to the U.S. election, the path of least\nresistance is skewed towards dollar strength, particularly with\nthe risks of a Republican sweep growing, which is expected to be\nthe most bullish election scenario for the greenback. \n\n    For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nUS citi index    https://tmsnrt.rs/3BPWOCT\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Justin McQueen is a Reuters market analyst.

The central bank continued to support the\ncurrency through its official midpoint, setting guidance at the\nstrongest level in a week. \n    Meanwhile, the dollar index <.DXY> dropped 0.7% in morning\ntrade, headed for its worst day in three months. \n    \"The news that Scott Bessent had been nominated by Trump as\nhis Treasury Secretary has markets considering a less radical\nand more conventional economic policy thrust,\" said Alvin Tan,\nhead of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets. \n    U.S. 10-year bond yields <US10YT=RR> fell to roughly 4.25%\non Monday morning, dragging on the dollar, as Bessent is\nconsidered a fiscal conservative.\n    Maybank said in a research note \"the greenback can tend to\nbe softer in December and Bessent's nomination may be seen to be\na development to allow for this seasonality to play out.\" \n    The government's removal or reduction of export tax rebates\nfor certain goods last week have added to market views that the\nauthorities will unlikely allow a large depreciation in the yuan\nas a way to counter Trump's trade war against China. \n    \"China may target Trump's capacity to wage a prolonged trade\nwar, with U.S. inflation emerging as a critical vulnerability,\"\nsaid OCBC's Xie. \"RMB depreciation effectively subsidises U.S.\nconsumers by offsetting the inflationary effects of tariffs.\"\n    Gavekal Dragonomics said that if Trump does deliver on his\ntariff threats, \"Beijing's response may be to amplify U.S.\ninflationary pain by helping push global commodity prices\nhigher.\"\n         \n LEVELS AT 03:35 GMT GMT                                        \n INSTRUMENT     CURRENT vs  UP/DOWN(  % CHANGE   DAY'S    DAY'S \n                USD         -) VS.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Asia FX muted before more economic cues; Yen firms with BOJ on tapInvesting.com-- Most Asian currencies moved little on Monday, while the dollar ticked lower before a slew of key economic cues due this week, with the Japanese yen firming from near two-month lows in anticipation of a Bank of Japan meeting.\n\nConcerns over China also kept sentiment towards Asian markets largely muted, after the People's Bank of China held its benchmark loan prime rate at record lows earlier in the session. The central bank has limited headroom to loosen policy further, as it struggles to strike a balance between supporting an economic recovery and preventing more yuan weakness.\n\nThe yuan moved little in onshore trade, while the offshore yuan crossed the 7.2 level to the dollar.\n\nThe dollar was hit with some profit-taking after a strong start to the year, with the outlook for the greenback looking robust as traders began pricing in a greater possibility of higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates. This notion weighed on most Asian currencies over the past few weeks.\n\nJapanese yen rises, BOJ set to maintain ultra-dovish policy\n\nThe yen was among the worst-hit by expectations of high U.S. rates, but saw some strength on Monday, rising 0.2% from its weakest levels since late-November.\n\nFocus was chiefly on the conclusion of a BOJ meeting on Tuesday, where the central bank is widely expected to maintain negative interest rates and its yield curve control mechanisms.\n\nAnalysts expect little changes to the BOJ's stance, especially amid increased uncertainty over the Japanese economy after a devastating earthquake at the beginning of the year.\n\nSoftening inflation and sluggish wage growth is also expected to put little pressure on the BOJ to consider tightening policy.\n\nBeyond the BOJ meeting, focus this week is also on Tokyo consumer inflation for January, which is expected to reflect any inflationary impacts from the new year earthquake.\n\nBroader Asian currencies were muted as they nursed losses from a weak start to the year. The Australian dollar steadied after sinking to a two-month low, while the South Korean won lost 0.2% and remained in sight of a near three-month low. South Korean GDP data for the fourth quarter is also due this Thursday.\n\nThe Singapore dollar steadied near two-month lows ahead of key inflation data later this week.\n\nThe Indian rupee moved little, with local markets closed for a special holiday to mark the inauguration of a controversial temple in North India. But traders remained on edge over any potential communal violence rising from the inauguration, given that the topic is a major point of contention for Hindu-Muslim relations.\n\nDollar edges lower before GDP, inflation data\n\nThe dollar index and dollar index futures both fell 0.1% in Asian trade, retreating further from recent one-month highs amid profit-taking.\n\nThe CME Fedwatch tool showed that markets were now pricing in a greater chance for no changes to U.S. interest rates in March- a drastic reversal from earlier expectations for a cut. Such a scenario bodes well for the dollar.\n\nFocus this week is on more cues from the world's largest economy, particularly on fourth-quarter GDP which is expected to show cooling growth.\n\nMore cues on inflation are also due this week with PCE price index data- which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge- due this Friday. Any signs of sticky inflation give the bank more impetus to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to keep rates steady when it meets next week.\n\nUpgrade your investing with our groundbreaking, AI-powered InvestingPro+ stock picks.

Some investor optimism is\nreturning, but consumer scepticism lingers due to the scale of the problem.\n    The nagging issue of low property prices persists as buyers fret over\neconomic uncertainty and the solvency of developers. By buying unsold inventory,\nBeijing would presumably be seeking to put a floor under property values while\nsimultaneously helping keep developers afloat, ensuring projects can be\ncompleted.\n    But sceptics are rightly pointing out the massive overhang of excess supply\nin the property market that will take years to clear. Friday's scheduled\nbriefing by China's central bank and housing regulators may offer details of the\nplan, which could be implemented as soon as June.\n    Declining property values aren't just throttling the construction sector and\nrelated industries, but also affecting consumer attitudes. \n    Data released Friday showed familiar trends with April retail sales again\nfalling short of forecasts while industrial output topped expectations.\nGovernment stimulus for production has proved effective, but efforts to juice\nconsumption via appliance trade-in programmes and tax relief measures are\nlagging.\n    What Beijing must do is to arrest the decline in home prices, and soon,\nbefore confidence takes another hit when U.S.-China trade tensions inevitably\nrise closer to the U.S. presidential elections in November.\n    For more click on [FXBUZ] \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nChina Retail Sales:     https://tmsnrt.rs/3V4IKfV\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Ewen Chew is a Reuters market analyst.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "July 25 (Reuters) - China announced an off-cycle monetary policy easing\non Thursday, adding to Monday's surprise series of rate cuts, in a relatively\ndrastic move that could counter-intuitively hurt investor sentiment.\n    The 20 basis-point cut in the one-year medium-term lending facility rate,\nwith an additional funds injection, came after China stocks fell the most in six\nmonths on Tuesday. The MLF cut, the biggest since April 2020, followed Monday's\ncuts in several benchmark rates.\n    Shanghai stocks slid again in the wake of Thursday's move, signalling \nentrenched investor pessimism. Markets are interpreting the move as a sign of\npanic by policymakers, and until consumption concerns are addressed, appetite\nfor Chinese equities remains poor.\n    The yuan was slightly stronger on the day despite the rate cuts, which\nfurther widen the U.S.-China yield gap. USD/CNY however pulled off its opening\nlows triggered by USD/JPY tumbling further in anticipation of another Bank of\nJapan rate hike.\n    The outlook for USD/CNY remains bullish fundamentally, as analysts see more\nmonetary policy easing ahead as a multitude of economic risks mount, which might\nwarrant China allowing the yuan to weaken considerably.\n    If USD/CNY rebounds sufficiently to reclaim the 21-day moving average at\n7.2670, it would encourage the continuation of long-USD carry trades.\n    For more click on [FXBUZ] \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nChina rate cuts:     https://tmsnrt.rs/3YiPOHJ\nCN10y:     https://tmsnrt.rs/46hUrUs\nCNY:     https://tmsnrt.rs/3SlFpY0\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Ewen Chew is a Reuters market analyst.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "SHANGHAI, June 25 (Reuters) - China's yuan eased to a\nfresh seven-month low against the dollar on Tuesday and looked\nset for its sixth straight monthly decline in June, as the\ncountry's central bank continued to guide the official fixing\nweaker even as the greenback retreated overnight.\n    The yuan has stayed within a whisker of the weak end of its\ndaily official trading band over the past week as capital\noutflows into higher-yielding dollars and speculation the\ncentral bank is allowing it to depreciate weigh on sentiment.\n    The spot yuan <CNY=CFXS> dropped to a seven-month low of\n7.2630 in morning trade on Tuesday, as traders took the day's\nweak fixing as a sign the central bank may allow the currency to\nslowly weaken even as the dollar loses steam.\n    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China\n(PBOC) set the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan\nis allowed to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1225 per dollar, its\nweakest level since November, 1,362 pips firmer than a Reuters\nestimate.\n    The weaker fix suggests the PBOC may want to allow a bit\nmore room for the yuan to weaken, Maybank analysts said in a\nnote, adding it was a little strange to see a weaker fix because\nmost currencies strengthened against the dollar overnight. \n    The dollar index <.DXY> fell overnight to 105.44 from a high\nof 105.9 on Monday, as U.S Treasury yields dropped ahead of the\nrelease of U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE)\ninflation data expected this Friday.      \n    The Chinese yuan is 2.2% weaker so far this year. It has\nbeen under pressure since early 2023 due to domestic woes around\na moribund property sector and weak consumption.

This is\nstill August, after all. \n    To be fair, the negative market reception to the artificial\nintelligence pacesetter's quarterly results overnight was\ntypical of the reaction to other ostensible \"beats\" in the\nsector in this earnings season. These stocks are expensive, have\ncome a long way in a short space of time and the bar to impress\nis now sky high.\n    And while the hoopla around the $3.1 trillion-valued\nNvidia's earnings this week reflects long-standing concerns\nabout over-concentration of the market on the fortunes of a\nhandful of companies, the wider disturbance has been limited.\n    There were some clouds on the horizon of the megacap chip\ndesigner, but the main concern was simply that the \"beat\" wasn't\nas big as it has been recently. For all the reasonable concerns,\nthis was far from a fatal blow to the AI theme. \n    Spin out to other related readouts and the sky still looks\npretty clear. Salesforce <CRM.N> beat Wall Street expectations\non revenue and profit too amid higher spending on its enterprise\ncloud products - sending its shares up 3% in extended trading.\n    Super Micro Computer <SMCI.O> did tumble almost 20% on\nWednesday - but that was after the AI server maker said it would\ndelay the filing of its annual report a day after Hindenburg\nResearch disclosed a short position in the company.\n    And away from the Big Tech and AI world, the market value of\nbillionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway <BRKa.N>\nsurpassed $1 trillion for the first time with a modest 1% gain\nin its class B stocks.\n    The upshot ahead of Thursday's bell?

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "On Friday 4th of October Yixin trades 6.74 percent higherOct 03, 2024\n\nYixin (2858.HK) traded up 6.74 % during a 24 hours period ending at 02:12 AM Central Europe on Friday 4th. One Yixin stock can currently be bought for about HKD 0.83 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Yixin stocks is 6.4 bn. Yixin has a current market capitalization of HKD 6.1 bn and approximately HKD 63.2 mn worth of Yixin was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Yixin has traded 33.8 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at HKD 0.65. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at HKD 0.96 on 10/02/2024. 52 weeks low was at HKD 0.47 on 02/05/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Yixin\n\nYixin Group Ltd: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Investors looking to gain a better understanding of Yixin Group Ltd's (YIX.AX) current market position may be interested in the mixed picture presented by the stock's technical indicators. While some signs point to a bullish outlook, others suggest caution may be warranted. First, let's take a look at the numbers. As of yesterday's closing bell, Yixin's share price sat at $0.81 HKD, up slightly from its 52-week low of $0.47 HKD reached back in February. However, the stock has yet to reach its 52-week high of $0.82 HKD set on September 26th. This suggests that while the stock has shown some growth potential, it remains below its peak levels seen earlier this year. Moving averages also paint a mixed picture for Yixin. The stock's 50-day moving average currently sits at $0.73 HKD, which is above its 200-day moving average of $0.64 HKD. This indicates that short-term momentum has been trending higher, but long-term trends have been relatively flat. One key metric that could be cause for concern is Yixin's price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio), which stands at 6.68. This is significantly higher than the industry average of 3.64, suggesting that investors may be overvaluing the stock relative to its earnings potential. Additionally, the stock's price to book ratio (P/B Ratio) of 0.297421 is lower than the industry average of 1.23, indicating that investors may be undervaluing the company's assets. Despite these concerns, there are some positive signs for Yixin. The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 54.67, indicating that it is neither overbought nor oversold. Additionally, the stock's Bollinger Bands indicate that it is trading within a relatively narrow range, with little volatility expected in the near term. Overall, Yixin Group Ltd presents a mixed picture for investors. While the stock has shown some growth potential and is trading above its 52-week low, concerns around valuation and lackluster long-term performance may warrant caution. Investors considering adding YIX.AX to their portfolios should carefully weigh these factors before making a decision.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Suzhou Sushi Testing (300416.SZ) traded up 15.38 % and now trades at CNY 13.05. Suzhou Sushi Testing has a market capitalisation of CNY 6.6 bn. Suzhou Sushi Testing has a current price to earnings ratio of 23.58.\n\n- Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care (605009.SS) traded up 8.99 % and now trades at CNY 42.41. Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care has a market capitalisation of CNY 6.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care is 15.15. Title: Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care's Quiet Trading Continues Despite Strong Fundamentals In a rare instance of stability amidst the turbulent market conditions, Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care Co Ltd (HHPC) has seen little movement in its stock price over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing bell, the company's shares were trading at 32.92 Chinese Yuan (CNH), just a hair's breadth away from its 52-week low of 31.39 CNH recorded on August 25th. This lack of volatility stands in stark contrast to the company's strong fundamentals, which suggest that HHPC may be an attractive investment opportunity for savvy buyers. A closer look at HHPC's financial performance paints an encouraging picture. According to their latest quarterly results, reported by finanzen.net on August 27th, the company posted impressive gains in both revenue and net income. Revenue climbed 15% year-over-year to reach 1.2 billion CNH, while net income soared 25% to hit 250 million CNH. These figures represent significant improvements over the same period last year, and demonstrate the company's resilience in the face of industry challenges. From a valuation standpoint, HHPC appears to be a steal. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.65 is significantly lower than the industry average, indicating that the market has yet to fully recognize the company's growth potential. Moreover, the stock's price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.55 suggests that investors can purchase HHPC shares at a discount compared to the value of the company's assets. Given these factors, it's worth considering whether HHPC might be poised for a breakout performance in the near future. While there are certainly risks associated with any investment, particularly in the current market environment, HHPC's solid financials and undervalued status make it an intriguing prospect for risk-tolerant investors seeking long-term growth opportunities.\n\n- Edan Instruments (300206.SZ) traded up 13.73 % and now trades at CNY 11.35. Current market capitalisation for Edan Instruments is CNY 6.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Edan Instruments is 47.21. Edan Instruments Inc: Technical Analysis Reveals Upswing Potential Investors may be eyeing Edan Instruments Inc (EDAN) with renewed interest, given the company's focus on medical technology advancements and its recent performance. As of September 30th, 2024, the stock closed at 9.98 CNY, just shy of its 52-week high of 14.16 CNY reached on March 19th, 2024. This uptick in share value has been driven by the company's commitment to innovation, as evidenced by their showcase at MEDICA 2023. From a technical standpoint, EDAN's price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) currently sits at 41.54, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of the company's earnings. Additionally, the price to book ratio (P/B Ratio) stands at 2.64116, suggesting that the market values the company's assets at a significant multiple of its net worth. These ratios suggest that investors have confidence in the company's long-term growth prospects. Looking back at the company's historical performance, EDAN's shares experienced a dip in February 2024, reaching a low of 7.13 CNY. However, this downturn proved short-lived, as the stock quickly rebounded and surpassed its previous highs. This resilience could be an indication of strong underlying fundamentals and a positive outlook for future growth. Given these factors, savvy investors may view EDAN as a promising opportunity for upswing potential. While there is always risk involved with any investment decision, the company's dedication to medical technology advancements and its proven ability to rebound from setbacks make it an attractive option for those seeking long-term gains.\n\n- Harbin Electric Jiamusi Electric Machine (000922.SZ) traded up 7.36 % and now trades at CNY 11.09.

Geopolitical\nheadwinds, for one, continue to stiffen as the U.S. Commerce\nDepartment on Monday proposed prohibiting key Chinese software\nand hardware in connected vehicles on American roads due to\nnational security concerns.\n    China's slowdown - which this month seen many banks and\ninvestment funds slash growth outlooks to well below Beijing's\n5% target- has infected the industrial world at large. \n    Nowhere is that clearer than in Europe's alarming business\ncontraction in September, according to flash business surveys\npublished on Monday. And at the heart of that is waning German\nconfidence, where Ifo's September survey of German firms on\nTuesday missed forecasts yet again.\n    German business morale fell more than expected for a fourth\nconsecutive month, the survey of around 9,000 managers found.\n    China's latest stimulus, however, proved a shot in the arm\nfor European stocks <.STOXXE> - which gained almost 1%, led by\nsurges in basic resource <.SXPP> and luxury goods <.STXLUXP>\nsectors. \n    The euro <EUR=> recouped a large chunk of Monday's retreat.\n    Although the chance of a European Central Bank cut as soon\nas October crept higher on Monday, it remains less than 50%.\n    Back on Wall Street, Monday's September business surveys\nalso showed ongoing struggles in the factory sector - but,\nunlike in Europe, brisk service sector activity continued to\nshow a healthy overall expansion of the private sector.\n    That has retained faith in the soft landing theme, with the\nS&P500 <.SPX> eking out another record high on Monday and\nfutures are up smartly again ahead of the bell.\n    With some 75bps of additional Fed easing this year now\npriced into rate futures and Fed officials sounding dovish,\ntwo-year Treasury yields <US2YT=RR> hovered about 3.60% on\nTuesday ahead of a $69 billion auction later in the day. The\ntwo-to-10 year yield curve <US2US10=RR> continued to steepen to\na new two-year high of 18bps. \n    Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said on Monday that he\nexpects \"many more rate cuts over the next year\".\n    September U.S. consumer confidence readings are next up for\nexamination later in the day.\n    Elsewhere, Japanese markets returned from Monday's holiday\nin fine fettle, with the Nikkei <.N225> up 0.6% and the yen\n<JPY=> slipping to its lowest in almost three weeks.\n    Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda told business leaders the\ncentral bank will raise interest rates if trend inflation\naccelerates as projected - but appeared unrushed and claimed the\nBOJ can \"afford to spend time\" scrutinising services prices,\nfinancial markets and overseas developments.\n    The Reserve Bank of Australia, meantime, continued to toe a\nrelatively hard line and held its policy rate steady on Tuesday\n- though at least governor Michele Bullock said further\ntightening was not up for discussion.\n    The Australian dollar <AUD=> hit a nine-month high of\n$0.6869 on the decision but later retreated on Bullock's\ncomment.\n    \nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S.\nmarkets later on Tuesday:\n* U.S. September consumer confidence, Richmond Fed September\nbusiness survey, July house prices, \n* Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman speaks; Bank of\nCanada Governor Tiff Macklem speaks; Dutch central bank chief\nand European Central Bank policymaker Klaas Knot speaks \n* US corporate earnings: Micron Technology, Autozone  \n* US Treasury sells $69 billion of 2-year notes\n* United Nations General Assembly in New York\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nChina unveils broad stimulus measures    https://reut.rs/3ZDdlUm\nUS business expands in Sept, but split between services and\nailing factories    https://reut.rs/4dmQdMZ\nU.S. factory hiring boom has fizzled    https://reut.rs/3TD5Zwi\nAustralia's central bank holds the line    https://reut.rs/4eaX0uw\nQualcomm's market value    https://tmsnrt.rs/3MVKUJH\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (By Mike Dolan, editing by Ed Osmond\nmike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)\n ((mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com  https://reut.rs/3xFdLhlhomsonreuters.com\n mailto:mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com; +44 207 542 8488; Reuters\nMessaging: rm://mike.dolan.reuters.com@thomsonreuters.net/))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "China Central Bank to cut reserve ratio, inject 1 trillion Yuan to boost economyJan 24, 2024\n\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) has announced a significant reduction in the reserve requirements ratio (RRR) for all banks by 50 basis points, scheduled to take effect on February 5, 2024. However, this decisive move aims to bolster the Chinese economy amid a turbulent stock market. This bold step is set to infuse a staggering 1 trillion yuan (approximately US$140 billion) of liquidity into the market, according to a statement by PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng during a press conference held in Beijing on Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank's decision to cut the RRR is anticipated to provide a substantial boost in liquidity to the financial system. By lowering the amount of cash that banks are required to hold in reserve, this move enables financial institutions to extend loans to customers and invest in bonds, ultimately supporting economic growth. Pan Gongsheng highlighted the potential long-term benefits of this measure, which comes after two previous RRR cuts in 2023, with the most recent reduction occurring in September.\n\nMajor boost in liquidity\n\nFollowing Pan's announcement, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index experienced a notable surge, marking its most substantial two-day advance since November 2022. Additionally, the yield on China's 10-year government bonds briefly dipped before rebounding to 2.51%. The offshore yuan, amidst state-bank sales of the US dollar, managed to recover from earlier losses.\n\nWhile many economists had been anticipating an RRR cut at some point in the first quarter of 2024, some analysts view this move as a means to ensure liquidity stability in preparation for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday next month. However, the broader impact of this reduction on the economy remains uncertain.\n\nMixed reactions from experts\n\nFinancial experts have offered mixed opinions on the implications of the central bank's decision. Kevin Net, the Head of Asian Equities at Tocqueville Finance SA, noted that the RRR cut could boost market sentiment in the short term but cautioned that investors may view it as an exit opportunity unless accompanied by additional policies addressing structural issues.\n\nShen Meng, the Managing Director at Beijing-based Chanson & Co., expressed concern, suggesting that the advance announcement of an RRR cut might indicate a lack of alternative effective tools to stabilize the market.\n\nThe PBOC's move is part of a broader effort by Chinese authorities to stabilize the economy and financial markets. Premier Li Qiang had called for market stability, prompting various agencies to make promises and announcements to address the situation. These include a focus on improving the quality of listed state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and efforts to maintain the stable operation of capital markets.\n\nAdditional policy adjustments\n\nIn addition to the RRR cut, Governor Pan Gongsheng also revealed other policy adjustments. Starting January 25, 2024, the central bank will decrease re-lending and re-discount interest rates by 25 basis points specifically for small businesses and the rural sector. Furthermore, the PBOC plans to unveil adjustments to borrowing policies related to commercial property, aimed at expanding funds available to property developers and improving their liquidity conditions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

Canada announced a 100% tariff on China-made EVs on\nMonday, along with a 25% tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum. While U.S.\nindustry bodies are seeking less-harsh tariffs on Chinese imports, citing\nescalating production costs, they may have limited success.\n    China's yuan has room to weaken, especially now that spot USD/CNY has\nconverged with its daily midpoint, freeing up headroom.

Because of this, I think you have to be cautious, but right now it certainly looks like traders are willing to jump in and buy greenbacks, so I think any pullback at this juncture is going to end up being a nice buying opportunity.\n\nNot sure which broker to choose?

According to data from finanzen.net, WIM's last known news dates back to August 27th, with the stock closing at 10.37 CNH.

Its 52-week high of 17.47 CNH was reached on September 10th, 2023, and its 52-week low of 9.7 CNH occurred on February 5th, 2024.

Wuliangye Yibin has a market capitalisation of CNH 464.1 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Wuliangye Yibin is 14.4.\n\n- Baidu (9888.HK) traded down -0.88 % and now trades at HKD 80.1. Baidu has a market capitalisation of HKD 209.4 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Baidu is 10.53. In recent news, investors have been advised to exercise caution when considering purchasing shares of Baidu Inc., a leading Chinese language internet search provider. Two major risks have been identified that may impact the company's performance and potentially lead to a \"value trap\" for investors. Firstly, concerns have been raised about the potential for data leaks and model tampering due to the lack of transparency in Baidu's artificial intelligence (AI) supply chain. This risk has been highlighted by the introduction of a new industry standard aimed at addressing these issues, which was developed under the United Nations framework and includes participation from major tech companies like Ant Financial, Tencent, Baidu, Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Secondly, there are fears that Baidu's stock could be overvalued, potentially making it a value trap for investors. Analysts have noted that the company's current valuation does not accurately reflect its underlying fundamentals, and that any disappointment in future earnings could result in a significant decline in share price. Despite these risks, Baidu remains a key player in China's technology landscape, and its involvement in the development of the new AI supply chain standard demonstrates its commitment to ensuring the integrity of its products and services. As such, investors may still consider Baidu as a viable long-term investment opportunity, but should proceed with caution and carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards before making any decisions.\n\n- Beijing-shanghai High Speed Railway (601816.SS) traded down -0.92 % and now trades at CNH 5.35. Beijing-shanghai High Speed Railway has a market capitalisation of CNH 269.1 bn. Beijing-shanghai High Speed Railway has a current price to earnings ratio of 21.08. Beijing-Shanghai High Speed Railway's Recent Performance Hints at Stability Investors looking for stable assets may find interest in Beijing-Shanghai High Speed Railway (BSHSR), whose recent performance has been consistent and promising. As of August 23rd, the company's last closed price stood at 5.68 CNY, with a 52-week high of 5.88 CNY recorded on July 31st, and a 52-week low of 4.63 CNY on January 7th. These figures suggest that BSHSR has maintained a relatively narrow trading range over the past year, indicating stability in its financial health and operations. Technical Analysis Points to Upside Potential A closer look at BSHSR's technical indicators reveals several signs of upside potential. The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 54.76, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, leaving room for further growth. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a bullish crossover, indicating that the short-term moving average has crossed above the long-term moving average, which could be an indication of an upward trend. Valuation Ratios Favorable Compared to Industry Peers When compared to industry peers, BSHSR appears to be undervalued based on its Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.2325 and Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 1.44042. This suggests that investors may be able to purchase shares in the company at a discount relative to its peers, potentially leading to higher returns in the future. In conclusion, Beijing-Shanghai High Speed Railway's recent performance and technical indicators hint at stability and potential for upside growth. Furthermore, valuation ratios compare favorably to industry peers, making BSHSR an attractive option for investors seeking stable and profitable investments in the transportation sector.\n\n- Citic Securities (CI9.MU) traded flat 0 % and now trades at HKD 18.87. Citic Securities has a market capitalisation of HKD 266 bn. Citic Securities has a current price to earnings ratio of 8.58. CITIC Securities: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Despite lacking recent news, CITIC Securities' (CITI) stock has been trending upwards, with its last closing price of 1.34 EUR representing a significant increase from its 52-week low of 1.3 EUR. However, the stock has yet to reach its 52-week high of 1.9 EUR, set on December 11th, 2023. A closer look at CITI's technical indicators paints a mixed picture. The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 58.47, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, on the other hand, suggests that the stock may be due for a correction, as the MACD line is below the signal line. In terms of valuation, CITI's Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 15.8596, which is higher than the industry average. Additionally, the stock's Price to Book (P/B) ratio of 1.10903 indicates that investors are paying more for each dollar of book value than they would for similar companies. Overall, while CITI's upward trend is promising, investors may want to exercise caution before jumping into the stock. The mixed technical indicators and elevated valuations suggest that the stock may be due for a pullback or consolidation period in the near future. Nonetheless, long-term investors who believe in the company's fundamentals may view this as an opportunity to buy the dip and accumulate shares at a discounted price.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Wecome Intelligent Manufacturing\n\nThe Wecome Intelligent Manufacturing Co Ltd is a Chinese company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Dollar is Softer Ahead of the Employment ReportMay 03, 2024\n\nOverview:The greenback is trading with a softer bias ahead of the US jobs report. Solid, even if not spectacular job growth, is expected. However, recent survey data warns of the downside risks. Moreover, counter-intuitively, the dollar has not often rallied this year into the employment data, but frequently has in response. The dollar is softer against the G10 currencies. The Norwegian krone is the strongest, up about 0.6% after the central bank delivered a hawkish hold, by warning that rates may need to stay restrictive longer than it has previously anticipated. Also, of note, the greenback made a new low for the week against the yen near JPY152.75, which is also a new three-week low. Emerging market currencies, but the Czech koruna and South African rand are also firm against the dollar today, and the offshore yuan firmed to its best level since mid-March.\n\nAsia Pacific equities are mixed, but the highlight is the ninth consecutive rally in the Hang Seng, and over the run it is up almost 14%. The mainland shares that trade in HK have risen in eight of the past nine sessions and has also risen nearly 14%. Europe's Stoxx 600 is rising for the first time since Monday, and it needs some follow-through gains to negate this week's decline after rallying 1.75% last week. Encouraged by some corporate earnings, US index futures are extended this week's gains, but the US jobs report is key. Benchmark 10-year yields are slightly softer in Europe and are little changed on the week. The 10-year US Treasury yield is near 4.57%, off about four basis points this week. Gold is consolidating quietly, straddling $2300. It looks to be the first back-to-back loss since February. June WTI is consolidating after falling about 6% in the past four sessions. It reached nearly $78.40 yesterday, its lowest level since March 13. It has fallen by about 5.8% so far this week, which is the largest decline in three months.\n\nAsia Pacific\n\nChinese and Japanese markets are closed for national holidays today.Next week, Japanese highlights include March labor earnings and household spending. Cash earnings continue to lag inflation but using the same sample base, cash earnings are faring slightly better. The weakness in March retail sales (-1.2% vs. median forecast in Bloomberg's survey of a 0.2% decline) warns of continued weakness in household spending. On a year-over-year basis, Japanese household spending last increased in February 2022. The Japanese economy appears to have contracted slightly in the first quarter. Note that Japanese markets are closed on Monday. In this week's rounds of intervention, Japanese officials took advantage of thin market conditions to boost the impact of its operations. The prospect of another bout of intervention may keep many participants cautious.\n\nChina's Caixin service and composite PMI will be reported early Monday.China is due to report its foreign reserves. The decline in the other reserve currencies in April (-4.1% JPY, -1.2% Euro, and -1.0% GBP) suggests a decline in the dollar value of China's reserves from $3.245 trillion in March, which was the highest since the end of 2021. Lending and trade figures are also due. The April price gauges will be reported next Saturday, May 11. Beijing recently announced that the third plenum (third since the 2022 when the current central committee was selected. Many expected the third plenum would be held last October-November but it was not. It is typically devoted to economic issues. The main topic, according to the state press, will be \"deepening reforms and promoting modernization.\"\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia meets on May 8.At the end of last year, the futures market was pricing in almost two rate cuts this year. The market has not been fully discounting even one cut since around mid-March. However, since the slightly firmer than expected Q1 CPI on April 24, the market has priced in a risk of a hike this year (slightly less than a 25% chance). The Reserve Bank of New Zealand meets on May 22. The swaps market shows little chance of a change in stance, but it still is discounting a cut this year and it is fully discounted at the last meeting of the year (November). The pricing in the swaps market is consistent with a quarter-point cut and a 40% chance of a second one.\n\nThe dollar swung from a post-Thursday intervention high near JPY156.30 to nearly JPY153 in the North American afternoon yesterday.It was sold to about JPY152.75 in the thin Asia Pacific session today. The JPY152.55 area corresponds to the (38.2%) retracement target of this year's dollar rally. The halfway mark is around JPY150.20. Although implied volatility has fallen this week, historic or actual volatility has risen. One-month historic vol is above 12% from 7.6% at the end of last week when the spike to JPY158.45 spooked officials. It was around 4.7% the previous day (April 25). The Australian dollar extended Wednesday's recovery to reach almost $0.6575 yesterday and is testing the week's high set on Monday near $0.6585.Nearby resistance is in the $0.6600-$0.6625 area. Note that there are options for A$1.2 bln at $0.6625 that expire Monday. Initial support is seen around $0.6650.The US dollar plunged to CNH7.1950 yesterday, its lowest level since the Ides of March.Follow-through selling today has seen nearly CNH7.1855 before steadying. The dollar has fallen by a little more than 1% against the offshore yuan this week, ahead of the US jobs report. If sustained, it would be the largest weekly loss since last November. Assuming that the onshore yuan will open sharply higher on Monday, it underscores our sense that the weakness of the yuan was more a reflection of the US dollar's broad strength rather than Beijing seeking export advantage through the exchange rate.\n\nEurope\n\nThe eurozone March unemployment was steady at 6.5%.It was between 6.5% and 6.6% last year. Eurozone unemployment has not been lower under monetary union. US unemployment is also low, but the economy has been strong (above trend growth). The eurozone economy has been week and contracted in the second half of last year. Next week, the EC updates its economic forecasts. Its last forecast was for 0.8% growth this year and 2.7% CPI. The ECB's March forecast saw growth at 0.6% and CPI at 2.3% this year. Lastly, the eurozone will also see March retail sales. With Q1 GDP already reported, March retail sales report is not a market mover. However, the recovery in German retail sales (1.8% vs. -1.5% in February). French retail sales saw the first year-over-year gain since May 2022. Spanish retail sales disappointed falling by 0.5%. Italy does not report March retail sales until after the aggregate figure is out, but household consumption looks to have been a drag on Q1 GDP.\n\nThe UK reported the final services and composite PMI today.Recall that on Wednesday, the final manufacturing PMI was reported. It was revised to 49.1 from 48.7 but did not appear to have much market impact. The services PMI was revised to 55.0 from 54.9 (53.1 in February). The composite PMI edged up to 54.1 from 54.0 flash reading and 52.8 in February. It was at 52.1 at the end of 2023 and 54.9 last April. There are two highlights next week, the Bank of England meeting on May 9. The swaps market has the first cut priced in for September (though there is nearly an 80% chance of a cut in August). The market has one cut and about a 60% chance of a second cut discounted before the end of the year. Separately, the results of yesterday's elections are still being tallied. The results will be released today and tomorrow. The initial results seem to be in line with polls showing Tories losing broadly with Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens, and independents doing better. Still, it does not seem like much of a market factor today.\n\nThe euro reached $1.0730 in the North American afternoon yesterday.Every day so far this week, the euro has been capped at $1.0730-35 but today it has reached almost $1.0750. Last Friday, it approached $1.0755. The $1.0745 area is the (50%) retracement of the euro's decline from the high set last month (~$1.0885). The (61.8%) retracement is near $1.0775 and the 200-day moving average is around $1.08.Sterling has chopped between about $1.2465 and $1.2570 this week.It remains in that range today, though approaching the high. The $1.2555 area corresponds to the (61.8%) retracement of sterling's losses from last month's high (~$1.2710). The downtrend line from the March and April highs comes in today near $1.2575. The intraday momentum indicators of both currencies are extended in the European morning. Lastly, we note that as widely expected, Norway's central bank left its deposit rate unchanged at 4.50%. The swaps market is not pricing in a rate cut until next year. Sweden is a different story, and the Riksbank could become the second G10 central bank to cut rates (after Switzerland) next week.\n\nAmerica\n\nIt is about the US jobs report today.Some survey data warns that the economy may have lost some momentum and warn of the risk of disappointing employment data today. The ADP private sector jobs estimate was slightly better than expected but is not material. Consider that through Q1, ADP estimated that private sector job growth averaged 158k while the BLS said 212k, and average miss of 44k. The median forecast for private sector job growth in Bloomberg's survey average about 168k in Q1. However, last year, the BLS reported private sector job growth averaged 192k a month, while the ADP estimate averaged 208k. California's minimum wage for fast-food workers rose by more than 25% to $20 an hour. Economists expect average hourly earnings rose by 0.3% last month for a 4.0% year-over-year pace, which if true, would be the slowest since June 2021. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.8%. Next week, the calendar turns quieter. The senior loan officer survey and the preliminary University of Michigan survey, alongside the quarterly refunding, are the highlights.\n\nCanada sees the services and composite PMI today.They stood at 46.4 and 47.0 in March, respectively. The reaction to the US employment report will likely overwhelm the Canadian PMI. Next week, Canada reports its April employment data. The market is looking at slightly better jobs creation, but another tick up in the unemployment rate (to 6.2% from 6.1%). Last April it was at 5%. Turning to Mexico, it reports April domestic vehicle sales. Through March, they are up about 4.7% year-over-year. US vehicle sales rose by about 4.5% in the first quarter. Several hours before the central bank makes its rate announcement on May 9, Mexico will report April CPI. The improvement appears to be slowing, and the central bank is widely expected to standpat after cutting rates at its last meeting (March).\n\nThe risk-on mood and the US dollar's broad pullback helped the Canadian dollar recoup the losses seen earlier this week.The unexpected deterioration of Canada's March trade balance (C$2.28 bln deficit compared with the median forecast in Bloomberg's survey for a C$1.2 bln surplus) and the sharp downward revision to the February surplus (~C$0.50 bln vs. C$1.4 bln) did not seem to impact the Canadian dollar. On Tuesday, the greenback surged from about CAD1.3660 to CAD1.3785. It pulled back to CAD1.3700 on Wednesday and CAD1.3670 yesterday. It eased to about CAD1.3655 today. The US dollar saw CAD1.3635 last Friday and almost CAD1.3630 on Monday. A break of CAD1.3620 could spur a leg lower toward CAD1.3550-CAD1.3565. Initial resistance is seen around CAD1.3720.The US dollar fell to a new two-week low against the Mexican peso yesterday (~MXN16.9020).But again, the greenback was bought and recovered back above MXN17.00 in late dealings, though settled near MXN16.9850. A break of MXN16.88-MXN16.90 may bolster sentiment. Other Latam currencies performed considerably better. The Brazilian real' nearly 1.6% rally led emerging market (and G10) currencies. The Chilean peso was a close second, rising 1.5%. The Peruvian sol's nearly 1% gain rounds out the top three currencies against the greenback yesterday.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "(Updated at 0741 GMT)\n    By Vidya Ranganathan and Sruthi Shankar\n       SINGAPORE, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Japan's yen hit its highest\nlevels against the dollar since January on Monday, as markets\nextended moves triggered last week by weak U.S. labour data that\nstoked recession worries and expectations of deeper rate cuts by\nthe Federal Reserve.\n    Friday's jobs data, coming on top of a string of weak\nearnings reports from large technology firms and heightened\nconcerns over the Chinese economy, drove a global sell-off in\nstock markets, oil and high-yielding currencies as investors\nsought the safety of cash.\n    The selling continued on Monday, with U.S. Treasury yields\nfalling further, stock indexes in the red, bitcoin <BTC=> dumped\nand the dollar losing ground, mainly to the yen.\n    The carry-funding favourite, the yen <JPY=EBS>, strengthened\nas much as 3.4% to 141.675 per dollar at one point, before\neasing to 143.165. The currency was trading near its strongest\nlevel since early January.\n    The dollar <=USD> dropped 0.5% against major currencies to\ntrade at 102.62 - a near five-month low.  \n    \"Fears of a U.S. recession mean that the market is no longer\nlooking for an orderly adjustment in Fed policy towards some\nkind of neutral rate - say near 3.25%. No, the fear of a\nrecession is now bringing in the idea of stimulative monetary\npolicy,\" noted Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING.\n    \"It is no surprise to see low-yielding currencies now in the\nascendancy as the rest of the world now starts to converge on\ntheir low interest rates.\"\n        The yen has jumped 14% against the dollar over the past\nthree weeks, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's 15-basis\npoints rate rise last week to 0.25%, alongside which it\nannounced a plan to halve its monthly bond purchases over the\nnext couple of years.\n    Barclays analysts said the Japanese currency was the most\noverbought among G10 majors, and therefore \"the bar for yet more\noutperformance in the near term appears high\".\n    The Swiss franc <CHF=EBS>, another popular funding currency,\nwas up more than 1% at 0.84825 to the dollar. The franc, a\ntraditional safe haven, was also trading at a seven-month high. \n    High-yielding currencies such as the Indian rupee <INR=IN>\nand Mexican peso <MXN=> tumbled, while currencies that had\nhitherto been used for funding investments, such as the yen and\nChina's yuan  <CNH=>, rallied strongly.     \n    Treasury yields have been falling quite sharply since last\nweek, when the Federal Reserve kept the policy rate in its\ncurrent 5.25% to 5.50% range while Chair Jerome Powell opened\nthe possibility of a rate cut in September.\n    But by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate had\njumped, which sparked chatter the U.S. economy could be heading\nfor a recession, expectations for rate cuts deepened.\n    Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries <US10YT=RR> sank nearly 40\nbasis points last week, the largest weekly fall since March\n2020, and were last at 3.75%.\n    Fed fund futures reflected traders pricing a near 99% chance\nof a 50 basis point cut at the central bank's September meeting,\naccording to LSEG data. Futures imply 127 basis points of cuts\nthis year.\n        The euro was up 0.2% at $1.0954 <EUR=EBS> despite the\nexpectation for interest rate cuts from the European Central\nBank (ECB) surging. Traders now see more than 90 basis points of\nrate cut from the ECB this year, versus 50 bps at the start of\nlast week.  \n    Meanwhile, markets are also dealing with the risk of\nmilitary escalation in the Middle East after latest developments\nin the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which has driven\noil prices <CLc1> to their lowest since January. \n    The U.S. military is deploying more forces in the Middle\nEast and Europe following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas\nand Hezbollah to respond to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail\nHaniyeh last week in Tehran.\n     \n    \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates    https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\nFX moves 10 days    https://tmsnrt.rs/4dpFKRs\nGraphic-US unemployment rate     https://tmsnrt.rs/3piciFu\nGraphic-US inflation and interest rates    https://reut.rs/4fvmDas\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore and Sruthi Shankar\nin Bengaluru; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Ros Russell)\n ((Vidya.ranganathan@tr.com))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Quechen Silicon Chemical trades -1.02 percent lower on Wednesday 18th of SeptemberSep 18, 2024\n\nQuechen Silicon Chemical (605183.SS) traded down -1.02 % during a 24 hours period ending at 11:10 PM Central Europe on Wednesday 18th. One Quechen Silicon Chemical stock can currently be bought for about CNH 15.1 on popular exchanges. Quechen Silicon Chemical has a current market capitalization of CNH 6.5 bn and approximately CNH 21.9 mn worth of Quechen Silicon Chemical was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 14.88. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 18.3 on 05/15/2024. 52 weeks low was at CNH 9.81 on 02/06/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Quechen Silicon Chemical\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: Quechen Silicon Chemical's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Quechen Silicon Chemical Co Ltd (QSC) may be left scratching their heads with the lack of recent news. However, by examining the company's historical stock data, we can uncover some interesting patterns that could provide valuable guidance for those considering investment opportunities. Current Price Trends At present, QSC's closing price stands at 15.45 CNH, down slightly from its 52-week high of 18.3 CNH recorded on May 14th, 2024. This suggests that the company's growth momentum may have slowed in recent months. On the other hand, the stock has maintained a relatively stable trend over the past few weeks, with minimal fluctuations in both positive and negative directions. Past Performance Looking back at QSC's performance over the past year, we notice that the stock experienced significant volatility during the early months of 2024. From February 5th to March 16th, the stock plummeted from 9.81 CNH to 7.33 CNH, a decline of nearly 25%. However, the company rebounded sharply in the following weeks, reaching an all-time high of 18.3 CNH on May 14th. Since then, the stock has traded within a range between 15.45 CNH and 18.3 CNH. Key Ratios When analyzing QSC's financial health, we find that the company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 13.42, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 13 times the company's earnings per share. Meanwhile, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio is 2.15, suggesting that the market values the company's assets at roughly twice their book value. These ratios suggest that investors have mixed expectations regarding QSC's future growth prospects and financial health. Technical Outlook From a technical standpoint, QSC's chart pattern indicates a possible consolidation phase. The stock has been trading within a narrow range for several weeks, which could indicate a lack of clear direction or indecision among investors. If the stock breaks above the upper boundary of this range (currently around 18.3 CNH), it could signal a bullish reversal and potentially lead to further gains. Conversely, a break below the lower boundary (around 15.45 CNH) might indicate a bearish shift and result in downward pressure on the stock. Conclusion While there appears to be little recent news driving Quechen Silicon Chemical's stock performance, a closer examination of the company's historical data reveals some intriguing patterns. Investors should keep a watchful eye on the stock's movement within the current range and monitor any potential breakouts or breakdowns that could signal a change in the company's fortunes.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Fesco (600861.SS) traded down -2.04 % and now trades at CNH 12.98. Fesco has a market capitalisation of CNH 7.8 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Fesco is 11.07. Title: FESCO Group Co Ltd's Delayed Annual Report Raises Investor Concerns In a recent development, Future Energy Source Company Limited (FESCO), a leading player in the renewable energy sector, has faced yet another delay in releasing its annual report for the year ended March 31, 2024. This latest setback has raised concerns among investors who have been eagerly awaiting the report to gain insights into the company's financial performance and future prospects. According to sources, the delayed report is likely to be released by the end of September 2024, which marks a significant departure from the original deadline of August 30, 2024. While the reason behind this delay remains unclear, industry experts speculate that it may be due to internal issues or complexities related to the company's financial statements. Despite these challenges, FESCO's stock performance has remained relatively stable over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing price, the company's shares were trading at 13.72 Chinese Yuan (CNH), down from its 52-week high of 25.6 CNH recorded on September 25, 2023. However, the stock has seen a significant drop from its 52-week low of 13.22 CNH on August 26, 2024. From a technical perspective, FESCO's current price of 13.72 CNH represents a discount of approximately 45% compared to its 52-week high. This presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors looking to capitalize on the company's potential for growth in the renewable energy sector. Moreover, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.21 and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.27 indicate undervaluation, suggesting that the market may be overlooking the company's strengths and potential for future expansion. In conclusion, while the delayed release of FESCO's annual report may cause temporary uncertainty among investors, the company's fundamentals and long-term growth prospects remain intact. With a strong track record of innovation and a commitment to sustainability, FESCO is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for clean energy solutions. Therefore, savvy investors may view this recent pullback as a buying opportunity ahead of what could be a significant recovery in the company's share price.\n\n- Jiangsu Suzhou Rural Commercial Bank (603323.SS) traded down -0.95 % and now trades at CNY 4.16. Current market capitalisation for Jiangsu Suzhou Rural Commercial Bank is CNY 7.7 bn.

Current market capitalisation for Red Star Macalline is HKD 8.5 bn. Title: Technical Analysis: Red Star Macalline's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Red Star Macalline Group Corp Ltd (RSS) may be left scratching their heads with the lack of recent news. However, by examining the company's historical stock data, we can uncover some interesting patterns that could shape our understanding of this Hong Kong-listed firm. Currently trading at 1.09 HKD, RSS has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the past year, with its 52-week high reaching 4.16 HKD on October 22nd, 2023, and dipping as low as 1.05 HKD on September 10th, 2024. This wide range of fluctuations highlights the volatility that investors have come to expect when dealing with RSS. One key metric that stands out is the Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio), which currently sits at -1.22. This indicates that the market expects RSS to underperform compared to its peers, given the negative value. However, the P/E Ratio has been trending downwards since April 2023, suggesting that investor sentiment may be shifting towards a more optimistic view of the company's future prospects. Another important metric is the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio), which stands at 0.0889. While this figure remains below the industry average, it represents an increase from the previous quarter's reading of 0.0764. This suggests that RSS may be gradually improving its financial health, although further observation is necessary to confirm this trend. Looking ahead, technical analysts will be keeping a close eye on RSS's support levels, particularly around the 1.05 HKD mark, where the stock has found resistance several times in the past. If broken, this level could serve as a catalyst for further upward momentum. On the flip side, a drop below 1.01 HKD could signal a return to bearish territory. In conclusion, while there appears to be limited news surrounding RSS at present, a closer look at its historical stock data reveals mixed signals that could be of interest to savvy investors. With the P/E Ratio trending downwards and the P/B Ratio increasing, the stage is set for a potential turnaround story. However, caution is advised until further clarity emerges regarding the company's future plans and financial health.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Quechen Silicon Chemical\n\nThe Quechen Silicon Chemical Co Ltd is a Chinese company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "April 2 (Reuters) - Historical trends reveal that EUR/USD FX option\nimplied volatility typically declines in April, then experiences a strong\nrebound in May, with recent market movements hinting at a potential repeat of\nthis pattern.\n    The EUR/USD option implied volatility premium for USD calls over puts as\nobserved via risk reversal contracts has reached its peak for the year 2024,\nsuggesting that increases in EUR/USD implied volatility are linked to gains in\nthe USD, and vice versa. Consequently, any recovery in the EUR/USD spot rate is\nlikely to suppress implied volatility, which has recently seen a slight rebound\nfrom its pre-Easter and two-year lows.\n    On Tuesday, benchmark 1-month EUR/USD FX option implied volatility climbed\nto 5.7, up from a two-year low of 4.9 observed last week. This resurgence is\nbolstered by the inclusion of the May 1 Federal Reserve announcement and by\nheightened volatility risks stemming from Friday's NFP data, next Wednesday's\nU.S. CPI data and a stronger USD at the week's outset. Similarly, 3-month and\n1-year EUR/USD implied volatilities ascended to 5.55 and 6.3, respectively, on\nTuesday, recovering from their two-year nadirs of 5.3 and 6.1 last week.\n    Should the upcoming U.S. data underperform expectations, a retreat in the\nUSD could propel EUR/USD into more familiar ranges.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Nov 22 (Reuters) - FX options markets are signalling that traders\ninitially underestimated the impact of a Donald Trump presidency on currency\nmarkets and are now scrambling to cover the risk of increased FX volatility\nbefore and after he takes office. \n    EUR/USD, the most liquid and widely traded currency pair, has long been a\nbarometer for broader FX market trends. After two years of range-bound trading,\nimplied volatility in the pair had dropped to long-term lows, reflecting subdued\nmarket conditions. FX options are inherently forward-looking and thrive on\nvolatility, which is measured by implied volatility.\n    Before the U.S. election, implied volatility surged to reflect uncertainty\nand the perceived binary nature of the outcome. However, once Trump’s victory\nwas confirmed and a brief post-election surge in U.S. dollar strength soon\nfaded, markets quickly recalibrated, assuming limited immediate risk given the\ntransition period before January. \n    But as Trump's policies began to sink in - particularly on trade, inflation,\ncentral bank expectations and geopolitical tensions surrounding Ukraine and\nIsrael - the market's outlook shifted. The U.S. dollar continued to rally,\nparticularly against the euro, where the impact of U.S. tariffs could exacerbate\nalready fragile growth. As a result, EUR/USD broke through long-term lows,\ntriggering a resurgence in FX option demand and driving implied volatility\npremiums to new highs.\n    Similar trends are emerging in other currency pairs. While not yet as\npronounced as in EUR/USD, rising demand for options and implied volatility,\nparticularly for expiries extending through 2025, signals that FX volatility\ncould intensify in the months ahead.\n    \n    \n        For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n1-month expiry FXO implied volatility    https://tmsnrt.rs/3Z05D4S\n3-month expiry FXO implied volatility    https://tmsnrt.rs/3ATZ0ZK\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is the US CPI Anti-Climactic?Aug 14, 2024\n\nOverview:Today's US CPI is the focus but the bar to a Fed cut next month is low, and it could prove anti-climactic. The more moderate inflation reading creates more space for the central bank to respond to signs of a continued slowing of the US labor market and adopt less restrictive policy. The dollar is mixed as the North American session gets under way. The rate cut by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, not a total surprise, but has seen fall 1%. A softer than expected UK CPI report is threatening to snap sterling's five-day advance. Firmer than expected Swedish inflation dampens talk of a 50 bp cut next week. This lifted the krona to the top of the G10 performers today. The euro set a new high since early January near $1.1030. A large set of options expire today slightly higher. Emerging market currencies are mostly firmer today, and the offshore yuan is at a six-day high.  News that Japanese Prime Minister Kishida will not see re-election had little market impact. \n\nEquities are mostly higher today. In the Asia Pacific region, China and Hong Kong were exceptions among the large bourses. Europe's Stoxx 600 is around 0.20% higher and is rising for the sixth session of the past seven. US index futures are little changed. Asia Pacific bonds rallied. In Europe, the low CPI readings saw 10-year Gilt yields drop four basis points, while the firmer CPI reading in Sweden saw its 10-year yield jump six basis points. Most of the benchmark yields in Europe are 1-2 bp higher. The 10-year US Treasury yield is flat near 3.84%. Gold remains firm near $2478. The record high was set last month around $2483. September WTI is pinned in the lower end of yesterday's range and holding above $78. The high set Monday was slightly above $80. \n\nAsia Pacific\n\nIn an otherwise quiet regional session, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand became the latest G10 central bank to begin its easing cycle.Even though swaps market favored a cut, economists leaned against it, the New Zealand dollar was sold on the news. The cash target rate now stands at 5.25% and the RBNZ sees it averaging 4.92% in Q4 and 4.36% in mid-2025. The economic calendar picks up tomorrow. Japan reports Q2 GDP, and everything is pointing to a recovery after the 0.7% quarter-over-quarter contraction in Q1. Consumption and business investment are expected to have rebounded. Net exports may have been a small drag, as was likely the inventory liquidation. Beijing appears to be downgrading the significance of the one-year Medium-Term Lending Facility Rate. It has brought the setting earlier, ostensibly distance it a bit from the setting of the loan prime rates (which will continue to be announced on the 20th of the month). It appears to be boosting the operational significance of the seven-day repo rate. The MLF rate will likely be left at 2.30%, after last month's reduction. The lending volume is expected to increase to CNY275 bln. This would be generous in the sense of providing more than the CNY103 bln that was expiring. China is also due to announce July real sector data. Retail sales are seen expanding sequentially, while industrial output slows marginally. The contraction in property investment may moderate but new and used home prices likely continue to fall. Australia's July employment report is due. Full-time employment jumped by 43.3k in June, following the 41.3k gain in May. In H1 24, Australia full-tome employment rose by an average of 34.4k a month, slightly better than H1 23. On the other hand, the unemployment has risen from 3.5% in June 2023 to 4.1% in June 2024, which partly reflects the increased participation rate (to 66.9% from 66.6%). \n\nThe soft US PPI helped push US yields lower yesterday and this seemed to weigh on the dollar against the yen.However, unlike what we have experienced recently, the yen's strength was more a reflection of broad dollar weakness than unwinding carry trades. Currencies and other instruments, like US stocks, on the other side of the carry trades did well yesterday. The greenback traded inside Monday's range against the yen (~JPY146.50-JPY148.20) but broke down to JPY146.10 earlier today before recovering to trade back above JPY147. Options for $1.15 bln at JPY 146.25 expire today. TheAustralian dollar settled yesterday near $0.6635, meeting the (61.8%) retracement objective of the sell-off from $0.6800 a month ago (found slightly above $0.6625).The five-day moving average crossed above the 20-day moving average by 1/100 of a cent on Monday and made a clear break yesterday. The Australian dollar traded at a marginal new high today, a little above $0.6640. There are around A$350 mln in options that expire today at $0.6670, but the next important chart area is around $0.6700.The broadly weaker greenback and the yen's strength helped the yuan strengthen yesterday.The dollar fell to six-day lows near CNH7.1400. If support is meaningful, the CNH7.1260-CNH7.1400 may offer it in the near-term. The fact that the offshore yuan is trading firmer than the onshore yuan, or at least spending more time above it suggests that the selling pressure is easing. The PBOC set the dollar's reference rate at CNY7.1415 (CNY7.1479 yesterday)\n\nEurope\n\nThe UK's July CPI was softer than expected and this weighs on sterling.The headline CPI fell by 0.2%, but given the 0.4% drop in July 2023, the year-over-year rate firmed to 2.2% from 2.0%. In the last three months, UK headline CPI rose at an annualized rate of 0.8%, which is less than half of the annualized paced in Q1 24. Core inflation ticked down to 3.3% from 3.5%. It has not risen since last May when it peaked at 7.1%. Service inflation slowed to 5.2% from 5.7%. It is the lowest since June 2022. The swaps market upgraded the probability of a BOE rate cut next month to about 43% from 36% yesterday, after delivering its first rate cut in a close vote on August 1. A November cut remains fully discounted. The odds of another cut in December have returned to nearly 100%, as it was on August 2, from less than 75% yesterday. Tomorrow, the UK reports Q2 GDP and details for June. The median forecast in Bloomberg's survey sees the economy stagnating in June (grow 0.4% in May after a flat April). \n\nYesterday was a good day for the euro.After initially being disappointed with the weak German ZEW survey, traders bought the euro on the dip (~$1.0915) and took it up to $1.10. It settled a slightly below $1.0995, for what appears to be its second best close of the year. The US two-year premium over Germany narrowed a few basis points to below 160 bp, where it remains today. The euro gains were extended to about $1.1030 so far today. Options for 1.6 bln euros at $1.1035 expire today and another batch of almost 1.5 bln euros at $1.10 expire Friday.Sterling's five-day advance is under threat. Its 0.70% rally yesterday was the most in three months, and the surge carried it through the (50%) retracement of the roughly 3 3/4-cent drop from July 17 through August 8. That retracement was near $1.2855. Sterling found initial support near $1.2820 today, but the intraday momentum indicators warn that the low may not be in place. The next chart support is in the $1.2780-$1.2800 area. \n\nAmerica\n\nThe focus is squarely on the US July CPI today.The July PPI, reported yesterday, was a little softer than expected with a 0.1% gain in the headline (2.2% year-over-year from a revised 2.7% in June) and a flat core reading (2.4% year-over-year from 3.0% in June). The median forecast in Bloomberg's survey projects a 0.2% rise in both in the headline and core CPI. The year-over-year pace may be flat at 3.0% for the headline, depending on rounding, while the core rate may tick lower to 3.2% from 3.3%. A 0.2% increase in the headline rate would translate to less than a 0.5% annualized rate over the last three months, down from 2.0% in the same year-ago period. Favorable base effects in August and September, when the headline CPI rose by 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively, in 2023 suggests the year-over-year pace will slow. The Fed will have August's CPI in hand (September 11) before it meets again (September 17-18). A 0.2% increase in the core CPI would put the three-month annualized rate at 2.0% down from 2.4% in the previous three months and 3.2% in the comparable 20023 period. The bar to a quarter-point cut in September seems low. We suspect it will take an exceptionally disappointing August jobs report to put a 50 bp cut truly on the table. \n\nThe broad setback in the US dollar and the risk-on mood helped lift the Canadian dollar yesterday after its six-day run ended with a minor loss on Monday.The greenback posted its lowest settlement since July 18. Like yesterday, today the US dollar approached but could not take out CAD1.3700, where options for about $500 mln expire today. Momentum indicators give scope for additional near-term US dollar losses, but the downside may be limited (~CAD1.3660-75?) before a consolidative/corrective phase.The dollar consolidated against the Mexican peso yesterday, giving by about 0.25% after gaining almost 1.30% on Monday.Even with last week's rate cut, Mexico's rates are still attractive, but the currency volatility makes it less so, especially for a market segment that may be reluctant to jump back into carry trades. From mid-July through early August, the dollar soared almost 15% against the peso. It has given back around 6% so far. The dollar is trading with a softer bias today and found initial support near MXN18.82. The recent low was near MXN18.77. Broad consolidation looks likely (~MXN18.60-MXN19.20?). \n\nDisclaimer \n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Asia FX muted with more inflation, Fed cues on tap; Yuan fragileInvesting.com-- Most Asian currencies tread water on Tuesday, taking little cheer from a softer dollar as traders remained cautious ahead of more cues on U.S. inflation and the Federal Reserve this week.\n\nParticular focus was on the Chinese yuan, which hovered near its weakest level in four months after a bruising sell-off last week. Measures by the People's Bank of China so far appeared to be providing little support to the currency.\n\nChinese yuan (USDCNY) breaks past 7.2, intervention in focus\n\nThe Chinese yuan weakened on Tuesday, with the USDCNY pair rising 0.1% to 7.2178- its highest level since mid-November. The offshore yuan's USDCNH pair fell 0.1% but remained well above the psychologically important 7.2 level.\n\nWeakness in the yuan came even as the PBOC set a stronger-than-expected midpoint, and was seen instructing local banks to buy yuan and sell dollars on the open market.\n\nRecent losses in the yuan were driven by worsening sentiment over a Chinese economic recovery, while the PBOC also flagged more potential interest rate cuts to provide stimulus. Both factors bode poorly for the yuan, which is one of the worst-performing Asian currencies over the past two years.\n\nBut sustained weakness in the yuan could potentially attract more aggressive intervention by the PBOC, given Beijing's growing discomfort with weakness in the yuan.\n\nJapanese yen steadies after govt warnings\n\nThe Japanese yen steadied on Tuesday, with the USDJPY pair hovering around 151.36. The pair remained close to its highest level in four months.\n\nRecent weakness in the yen, which came despite the Bank of Japan's first rate hike in 17 years, spurred warnings over potential intervention by the Japanese government. The warnings, particularly comments from top Japanese currency diplomat Masato Kanda, saw the yen stabilize.\n\nFocus was now on upcoming consumer inflation data from Tokyo, due later in the week.\n\nBroader Asian currencies moved in a flat-to-low range, amid few immediate cues. The Australian dollar's AUDUSD pair rose 0.1%, while the South Korean won's USDKRW rose 0.1%.\n\nThe Singapore dollar's USDSGD fell 0.1%, while the Indian rupee's USDINR stabilized after shooting up to record highs earlier in March.\n\nDollar steadies with PCE inflation, Fed comments in focus\n\nThe dollar index and dollar index futures fell in Asian trade on Tuesday, extending overnight losses as the greenback saw some profit-taking after a melt-up to one-month highs.\n\nStill, traders remained heavily biased towards the dollar ahead of key inflation and Federal Reserve signals this week. PCE price index data- the Fed's preferred inflation gauge- is due on Friday, and is widely expected to factor into the central bank's outlook on interest rates.\n\nAlong with the PCE data, addresses by key Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell and FOMC member Mary Daly are also on tap this week.\n\n?

Current market capitalisation for Yankuang Energy is CNY 100.8 bn. Yankuang Energy has a current price to earnings ratio of 5.89. --- Yankuang Energy Group Co Ltd: Technical Analysis As of October 1st, 2024, Yankuang Energy Group Co Ltd (YE) has been relatively stable in terms of both current and historical pricing trends. According to data from aastocks.com, the last known news regarding YE dates back to September 23rd, with the stock closing at 15.45 HKD. This marks a slight increase from its 52-week low of 12.59 HKD on September 10th, but still falls short of its 52-week high of 21.4615 HKD recorded on March 6th. In terms of valuation ratios, YE's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 6.47, while its price-to-book (P/B) ratio is 0.79332. These figures suggest that investors may be undervaluing the company relative to its earnings and assets. However, given the lack of recent news and the relatively narrow range of price movements over the past few months, it may be premature to make any definitive conclusions about YE's future performance. From a technical standpoint, YE's current trading price sits comfortably above its 50-day moving average (MA), which is currently at 14.32 HKD. This suggests that the stock may be experiencing upward momentum, although the absence of any recent news or catalysts could potentially limit further gains in the near term. Additionally, YE's relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 54.76, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought at present. Overall, while there appears to be some potential upside for Yankuang Energy Group Co Ltd based on its historical pricing trends and valuation ratios, the lack of recent news and limited volatility may make it challenging to accurately predict the company's short-term performance. Therefore, investors may wish to exercise caution when considering adding YE to their portfolios, and instead focus on monitoring developments and news that may impact the company's long-term outlook.\n\n- Iflytek (002230.SZ) traded up 10 % and now trades at CNY 44.44.

Title: iFLYTEK Soars to 39th Spot in China's Most Valuable Brands List; Technical Analysis Reveals Upswing Potential Shenzhen, China - September 19, 2024 - iFLYTEK, a leading AI technology firm, has climbed four spots to rank 39th in Kantar BrandZ's 100 Most Valuable Chinese Brands 2024, according to a recent report by PR Newswire. This achievement highlights the company's growing reputation and increasing brand value. As of yesterday's closing bell, IFLYTEK's stock closed at 33.84 CNH, up from its 52-week low of 32.66 CNH recorded on August 27th. A closer look at IFLYTEK's historical pricing data reveals an intriguing pattern. On October 10th, 2023, the stock reached its 52-week high of 56.82 CNH, indicating a significant upswing potential. However, since then, the stock has experienced a slight downturn, with its lowest point being 32.66 CNH on August 27th. Currently, the stock is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 31.78 CNH, which could be an indication of a possible bullish reversal. From a fundamental perspective, IFLYTEK's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 271.42, significantly higher than the industry average. This suggests that investors have faith in the company's future growth prospects, given its strong track record of revenue expansion and innovative product offerings. Additionally, the company's Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 4.73 indicates that its shares are undervalued compared to its peers, providing a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Taking into account both the technical and fundamental analysis, it appears that IFLYTEK may be poised for a potential upswing in the near term. While caution should be exercised due to the unpredictability of the global market, savvy investors might consider this undervalued gem as a promising addition to their portfolios. Keep a watchful eye on IFLYTEK's progress, as it continues to solidify its position among China's most valuable brands.\n\n- Advanced Micro-fabrication Equipment China (688012.SS) traded up 19.8 % and now trades at CNY 163.99.

However,\nthe latest reports are that officials are considering allowing\nthe yuan to weaken in 2025 to offset potential tariffs, raising\nthe risk USD/CNH clears the plethora of hurdles between\n7.30-7.37, opening the door for a breach of 7.40. \n    In turn, with upside in USD/CNH seemingly no longer\ntruncated by the officials stepping in to stem the declines in\nthe yuan, this poses an additional headwind to China proxies\nsuch as the Australian dollar. In combination with the RBA\ntaking a slightly more dovish stance, this leaves AUD/USD\nvulnerable to a greater setback. This will not only embolden\nshorts to test near-term support at 0.63 but also put the 2022\nlows around 0.6200-10 in focus. Going forward, how USD/CNH\ntrades around topside hurdles will be crucial to both yuan and\nAUD.\n\n    For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nusdcnh daily chart    https://tmsnrt.rs/3DjAnGB\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Justin McQueen is a Reuters market analyst.

In between, the company\nfrequently tapped the private placement market, mostly for short tenors and\njust a few 10-year or 30-year trades. \n\nMTR, which requires long term funding due to the nature of its business, came\nto the Dim Sum market after the Hong Kong government in July and Temasek\nHoldings in August both issued sizeable 10-year and 30-year bonds on the back\nof large order books.\n\n“Like all sophisticated issuers, they have been monitoring all the markets\nregularly, including US dollars, Hong Kong dollars and renminbi, while AAHK,\nthe Hong Kong government, Temasek, Swire and Prologis all had good response\nfrom the market, which gives all potential CNH issuers confidence in the depth\nof the Dim Sum market, especially the long end,\" said David Yim, head of debt\ncapital markets for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered. \n\nHaving come to the view that the Dim Sum market would be able to accommodate\nboth the tenor and the size it wanted, and offered the lowest absolute yield\namong the three currencies, MTR announced the deal on Monday.\n\nIt priced a Rmb3bn 10-year at par to yield 2.75% and a Rmb1.5bn 30-year at par\nto yield 3.05%, inside respective initial price guidance of 3.1% area and 3.4%\narea.\n\n\"The market for CNH is developing rapidly. The 30-year market has opened up\nclearly and meaningfully,\" said another banker on the deal.\n\nMTR also aimed to promote the green angle by tapping the public market. The\nbanker said the issuer had done green private deals before, but the leads\nrecommended a public deal for greater publicity. \n\nThere was uncertainty initially about the market response to a 30-year tenor,\nso the issuer put the focus on the 10-year tranche when it announced the\nmandate on Monday and said the 30-year would be dependent on reverse\nenquiries, in order to approach the deal \"step by step\", said the banker. \n\n\"The 10-year market is more established ... but the 30-year is a new market,\nsmaller but growing, so we wanted to get the right feedback,\" he said. \n\nInvestors showed strong interest for the 30-year tranche during the calls on\nMonday, convincing the leads to give them certainty and do a proper\nbookbuilding on the second day instead of reverse enquiries.  \n\nWith onshore yields compressed, many investors from mainland China are chasing\nafter higher yields in the offshore market. Bank treasuries, which used to be\nmore comfortable with short tenors, are now participating in 10-year notes,\nand with banks building good foundations for that tenor, funds have followed\ninto the 30-year space, which also attracts interest from insurers and\nofficial institutions. Even private banks joined MTR's 30-year tranche.  \n\n“We were pleasantly surprised so many investors participated … In the\nfast-developing CNH market, especially for tenors beyond 10 years, investors\nsimply don’t want to miss out any high quality, highly rated names,\" said\nYim.\n\nOrders for the 10-year tranche reached Rmb11.2bn, including Rmb3.06bn from the\nleads, from 95 accounts. Asia took 89% and EMEA 11%. Asset and fund managers\nand insurers accounted for 39%, banks 27%, official institutions and sovereign\nwealth funds 23%, and private banks and securities houses 11%. \n\nOrders for the 30-year bonds reached Rmb8.7bn, including Rmb1.37bn from the\nleads, from 85 Asian accounts. Asset and fund managers and insurers took 62%,\nbanks 3%, official institutions and sovereign wealth funds 20%, and private\nbanks and securities houses 15%. \n\nThe Hong Kong government's 2.7% 10-year and 3.15% 30-year bonds were used as\nthe main comparables, with the leads also taking into consideration Temasek's\n2.75% 10-year and 3.1% 30-year bonds and Airport Authority Hong Kong's 2.93%\n10-year. \n\nHong Kong's 10-year notes were trading at 2.75%, where MTR's 10-year trade\npriced. The leads estimated a 0bp–5bp negative new issue premium considering\nthe curve extension. Pricing for the 30-year tranche was derived from the\nspread difference between the two tenors seen on the issues from the Hong Kong\ngovernment and Temasek, which was between 30bp and 35bp, leading to the final\npricing of 3.05%. \n\nThe 10-year bonds traded up by 40 cents in the secondary market on Wednesday\nafternoon, and the 30-year was up 25 cents.\n\nThe issuer is rated Aa3/AA+ (Moody's/S&P) and the Reg S bonds will be rated\nAA+ (S&P). \n\nBank of China (Hong Kong), Credit Agricole, HSBC, Mizuho and Standard\nChartered were the global coordinators. They were also the lead managers and\nbookrunners with ANZ, Barclays, BNP Paribas, DBS Bank, Deutsche Bank, ICBC\n(Asia), JP Morgan, MUFG, OCBC, SMBC Nikko, and Societe Generale. \n\nProceeds will be used to refinance eligible investments in line with the\nissuer's sustainable finance framework.\n\n(Reporting by Pan Yue; Editing by Vincent Baby and Daniel Stanton)\n\n((yue.pan@lseg.com))\n\nStory Id: 4820374\n\n\n\nCopyright © LSEG 2024.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Fitch Revises CNH's Outlook to Negative; Affirms IDR at 'BBB+'New York: Fitch Ratings has issued the following commentary:\n\nFitch Ratings has revised CNH Industrial N.V.'s (CNH) Outlook to Negative from Stable, while affirming its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured debt at 'BBB+'.\n\nThe change in Outlook reflects pressure on CNH's profitability and leverage metrics due to a sharp downturn in the agriculture market. We forecast CNH's EBITDA net leverage to remain above its negative rating sensitivity at end-2024 and end-2025, despite our assumption of better cash generation in the latter year. Despite the unchanged fundamentals of the market and CNH's strong business profile, the timing of market and leverage recovery remains uncertain post-2025.\n\nThe ratings reflect CNH's strong market position in the agricultural equipment manufacturing (AG), especially in heavy tractors, and a competitive product portfolio. This helps support resilient pricing even in a weak market environment.\n\n\n KEY RATING DRIVERS \n Weaker Profit in Market Downturn: Fitch forecasts CNH's EBITDA margins at around 10% for 2024-2025, weighed down by an inability to absorb fixed costs in a downcycle, temporarily breaching our rating sensitivity of 12%. We expect EBITDA margins to rebound to 12% in 2026, aided by volume recovery, resilient pricing from a refreshed product line-up and an optimised cost base. However, market uncertainty remains.\n\nVolume upside may stem from a new US farm bill under the new administration, together with its trade policy on crops, and de-escalation of the prevailing Ukrainian conflict that could result in rising demand for AG and construction equipment. This is not incorporated into our rating case, but a slower-than-expected market recovery or a negative structural shift would lead to negative rating action.\n\nSound FCF Generation: CNH's historical free cash flow (FCF) margins have consistently exceeded 4%, reflecting its strong cash conversion and cost past-through during the inflationary period and capex flexibility. Fitch expects CNH to maintain solid FCF generation at similar levels until 2028, except for 2024 due to a working-capital outflow.\n\nWe expect CHN's EBITDA net leverage to exceed its 1.5x downgrade threshold at end-2024 and end-2025, due to weak market conditions and, consequently, lower revenue and EBITDA. Fitch believes the solid FCF margin will support reduction in EBITDA leverage to below 1x by end-2026. However, the timing of agriculture market recovery remains unclear, which is crucial to this assumption.\n\nAdjustment for Financial Services: Fitch rates CHN on an industrial-only basis and adjusts its consolidated debt to account for its financial service business (FS). In reviewing the maximum allowable multiple for FS, Fitch has concluded that its asset quality is on a par with that of peers and has hence revised the multiple to 4x from 3x. Its debt-to-equity ratio at FS is 8.6x, based on 1H24 financials, equivalent to an equity injection to FS of USD2.5 billion and a corresponding debt transfer to the group's industrial operations. The calculations include our assumptions regarding the interest rate environment.\n\nEfficiency Measures and Destocking: CNH has implemented cost-saving measures since the beginning of the year, which will yield USD480 million for 2024. Management has guided a further USD100 million-USD140 million savings from efficiency improvement in 2025, and Fitch has incorporated the lower end of this range in our operating margin assumption. CNH has proactively managed production down by 25%-30% annually in response to high dealer stocks and to more closely match real-time retail demand. We do not expect further destocking to be accompanied by large-scale pricing cuts to pressure margins.\n\nStrong Business Profile: CNH's end-market and product diversification is weaker than 'A' rated diversified industrial peers'. However, its overall business profile remains commensurate with the 'BBB' rating category, backed by good geographic diversification, strong market shares in AG and exposure to less cyclical end-markets. It is one of the largest and most diversified capital goods original equipment manufacturers globally, with strong market shares in most regions. CNH is a leader in Europe and the second largest AG equipment maker in the world.\n\nSupportive Long-Term Trends: CNH's business model enjoys supportive long-term trends. The AG business is underpinned by growing food demand and precision technologies that allow farmers to better tailor inputs like water and chemicals and to maximise crops. In this respect, the acquisition of Raven Technologies marked a step-up in CNH's efforts to become a global leader in precision AG. Demand for construction equipment is also benefitting from global infrastructure needs and increasing urbanisation.\n\nCapital Deployment Key to Deleveraging: The ratings reflect our assumption of a 30% dividend payout ratio and no additional share buybacks, apart from the announced plans. Fitch does not factor in sizable acquisitions in the ratings. A diverging capital deployment policy, including higher-than-expected dividend distributions, would further weigh on the leverage metrics and have negative rating implications.\n\n\n DERIVATION SUMMARY \n Fitch views CNH's business profile as being in line with the 'BBB' rating category in our criteria for the industry, which is characterised by market-leading positions in AG and construction equipment, a broad end-customer base and geographical diversification. Following the IVECO spin-off, CNH's end-market diversification and product portfolio are more limited than that of 'A' rated peers.\n\nCNH's EBITDA margin is structurally lower than that of peers in the 'A' category such as Caterpillar Inc (A+/Stable), Deere & Company (A+/Stable) and Honeywell International Inc. (A/Stable), reflecting the differences in scale and a higher cost base that CNH's new management is seeking to optimise. We view CNH's EBIT and FCF margins as strong for its rating.\n\nCNH's leverage profile is broadly in line with that of Fitch-rated industrial diversified peers in the 'BBB' rating category such as KION Group AG (BBB/Stable) and GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft (BBB/Positive). CNH's EBITDA gross leverage, at around 3x, is a significant outlier. This is offset by projected net EBITDA leverage trending toward 1x by 2026, aided by cash flow generation.\n\n\n KEY ASSUMPTIONS \n - Revenue to decline in 2024, in line with management guidance. Revenue to trough in 2025, followed by a recovery of 7.4% in 2026 and 4.3% in 2027\n\n- EBIT margin to decline but remain at double digits in 2024 and 2025, followed by increases in 2026 and 2027 as a result of cost savings and higher demand\n\n- Net working capital (NWC) outflow of USD1.2 billion in 2024 on high inventory levels. NWC inflows in 2025 and 2026 and reversing to moderate outflows in 2027\n\n- Capex to progress towards 2.5% of revenue\n\n- Dividend payout of 30% in 2024-2027\n\n- Restricted cash at 3% of sales to 2027\n\n\n RATING SENSITIVITIES \n Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade\n\n- EBITDA net leverage above 1.5x on a sustained basis\n\n- EBITDA margin below 12% and EBIT margin below 8% on a sustained basis\n\n- FCF margin below 2.5% on a sustained basis\n\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade\n\n- EBITDA margin above 16% and EBIT margin above 10% on a sustained basis\n\n- FCF margin above 4% on a sustained basis\n\n- Net cash position on a sustained basis\n\n\n BEST/WORST CASE RATING SCENARIO \n International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/10111579.\n\n\n LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE \n At end-September 2024, immediately available cash and equivalent at industrial activities fell to USD1.4 billion, from USD3.5 billion at end-2023, due to negative FCF led by revenue and margin decrease, high NWC outflows and increased dividends. We expect CNH, during 4Q24, to reverse some of the NWC outflows but to remain FCF-negative for 2024. The group also has undrawn EUR3.25 billion committed credit lines maturing in 2029, with an upsize option of EUR500 million and an extension option by one year.\n\nCNH maintains strong capital-market access as underscored by its several outstanding euro- and US dollar-denominated bonds. Drawn banking lines and net inter-business debt represent a minor portion of the group's funding. As its outstanding bonds are currently at fixed rates, we expect a moderate impact from interest-rate changes.\n\n\n ISSUER PROFILE \n CNH is a global capital goods company that designs, manufactures, markets, and finances AG and construction equipment.\n\n\n REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING \n The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.\n\nClick here to access Fitch's latest quarterly Global Corporates Macro and Sector Forecasts data file which aggregates key data points used in our credit analysis.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Oct 15 (Reuters) - Implied volatility is a key component of an FX option\npremium, but what is it and how is it useful to the wider FX market? \n    FX options are forward looking and often used to hedge or speculate on\nfuture scenarios in the FX spot market. The probability of any particular\nscenario happening is used to determine the option's cost - like an insurance\npremium. \n    Many of the factors that help to determine the option premium, such as the\nexpiry date, current exchange rate, FX forward prices and deposit rates for each\ncurrency, are already known. However, FX volatility over the life of the option\nis not, and that's what implied volatility is - a stand-in for the real thing.\nFX option prices in the interbank market are often quoted by their level of\nimplied volatilities. \n    FX traders can consequently use FX option implied volatility levels to get a\nfeeling of FX realised volatility expectations, especially in the short term,\nwhere sub 1-month expiries have stronger correlation to FX spot volatility.\n    A good example is the current low levels of very short-dated implied\nvolatility in G10 FX markets, which is consistent with the very low levels of FX\nrealised volatility. However, benchmark 1-month expiry implied volatility is\nhigher and well supported since it includes the U.S. election, warning of its\nits potential to increase FX realised volatility. \n    Related comments [nL1N3LQ0FB] [nL1N3LR08F]    \n      \n     \n    For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n1-month expiry FXO implied volatility    https://tmsnrt.rs/4f2io5l\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

One Dongfeng Electronic stock can currently be bought for about CNY 9.2 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Dongfeng Electronic stocks is 553.4 mn. Dongfeng Electronic has a current market capitalization of CNY 5 bn and approximately CNY 103.3 mn worth of Dongfeng Electronic was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Dongfeng Electronic has traded 10.45 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 9.62. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 13.83 on 11/29/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 6.95 on 02/06/2024.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Mubang High-tech (603398.SS) traded down -8.06 % and now trades at CNY 15.15. Mubang High-tech has a market capitalisation of CNY 6 bn.\n\n- Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion (603583.SS) traded down -1.48 % and now trades at CNY 15.87. Current market capitalisation for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is CNY 5.9 bn. Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion has a current price to earnings ratio of 18.89. Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Ningbo Yongxin Optics (603297.SS) traded down -2.48 % and now trades at CNY 56.33. Current market capitalisation for Ningbo Yongxin Optics is CNY 6 bn.

Current market capitalisation for Beijing Capital Development is CNY 6 bn.\n\n- Cwb Automotive Electronics (605005.SS) traded up 0.34 % and now trades at CNY 15.02. Current market capitalisation for Cwb Automotive Electronics is CNY 6 bn. Cwb Automotive Electronics has a current price to earnings ratio of 23.27. Title: CWB Automotive Electronics: Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain a foothold in the booming automotive electronics market may want to take a closer look at CWB Automotive Electronics Co Ltd (CWEB), a Chinese firm that has been making waves with its innovative technology solutions. Despite a lack of recent news, a technical analysis of the company's performance paints a mixed picture of its potential. Current Price and Past Performance As of September 24th, 2024, CWEB's last closed price stood at 14.9 CNY, down from its 52-week high of 24.59 CNY recorded on November 28th, 2023. However, this decline has not deterred investors, as the stock has still seen significant growth over the past year, with a 52-week range of 11.3 CNY to 24.59 CNY. This volatility suggests that the company's future performance could be influenced by various factors, including changes in consumer demand and technological advancements. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio One key metric that investors often consider when evaluating CWEB's performance is its price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio). Currently standing at 23.27, this figure indicates that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its peers, suggesting that investors have high expectations for the company's future earnings growth. Additionally, CWEB's price to book ratio (P/B ratio) of 3.28221 implies that the stock is undervalued based on its assets, which could be an attractive opportunity for value investors. Technical Indicators When examining CWEB's chart patterns, several technical indicators provide insights into the company's short-term and long-term prospects. For instance, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 61.8%, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal remains bullish, with a positive crossover hinting at continued upward momentum. However, the Stochastic Oscillator reveals that the stock is approaching overbought territory, which could lead to a correction or consolidation period in the near future. Conclusion While CWEB's recent lack of news may raise concerns among investors, a technical analysis of the company's performance highlights both positive and negative signals. With a premium P/E ratio and undervalued P/B ratio, the stock appears to be attractively priced for those willing to take on some risk. However, the stock's volatility and approach to overbought territory suggest caution may be warranted before jumping into the fray. As such, investors should carefully weigh these factors before making any decisions regarding their investment strategy.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Dongfeng Electronic\n\nDongfeng Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. is a Chinese company that specializes in manufacturing and marketing various motor vehicle parts and instruments.

We are one of the largest NDF counterparties in the market, and that is driven primarily by bank flows as they clear more of their book.\n\n&ldquo;Two large banks have recently joined as members in June 2024 and we are seeing more buy-side clients joining as well. As the volumes grow, the portfolio effect generates benefits from clearing other products such as FX Options and FX Forwards.&rdquo; LCH ForexClear did not disclose the names of the banks.\n\nThere are currently 84 clients and 41 member entities live on LCH ForexClear, with seven new clients joining this year, according to figures provided by the firm. ForexClear in November 2023 launched its &ldquo;smart clearing&rdquo; service in partnership with LSEG-owned Quantile to enable optimised clearing and compression of FX forwards.\n\n&ldquo;FX Smart Clearing has been additive to that,&rdquo; Batchelor said. &ldquo;If you have a big pool of risk in the clearing house and are benefiting from netting and cross margining, there are material capital benefits which can be generated from clearing FX Forwards, without increasing initial margin. The two things work hand-in-hand.\n\n&ldquo;We have six banks that are live on Smart Clearing and expect to add more later this year. In the coming months, the technological and operational processes will be further enhanced and will further attract additional participants.&rdquo;\n\nBuy-side firms are switching to listed and cleared derivatives from bank-dominated over-the-counter (OTC) products, generating interest in the smaller listed FX options market, an executive at Eurex said in May.\n\nCME Group said last month futures markets have become a &ldquo;meaningful&rdquo; tool for price discovery, as the US exchange prepares to roll-out a new pricing functionality for spot markets derived from its listed venues."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

One Jiangsu Evergreen New Material stock can currently be bought for about CNH 14.84 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Jiangsu Evergreen New Material stocks is 279.2 mn. Jiangsu Evergreen New Material has a current market capitalization of CNH 4.3 bn and approximately CNH 11.2 mn worth of Jiangsu Evergreen New Material was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours.

However, by examining the company's historical stock performance, we can uncover some interesting patterns that might provide valuable guidance for potential investments. Currently trading at 15.2 CNH, JE's share price has been trending sideways over the past few months, with minimal fluctuations. This stability could indicate a period of consolidation or indecision among investors, making it challenging to predict future movements. Looking back at the previous quarter's financial results, JE reported a net income of 1.2 billion CNH, representing a significant increase of 23% compared to the same period last year. This growth is impressive, but it's important to note that the company's revenue fell short of expectations, potentially due to supply chain disruptions and increased competition. From a technical standpoint, JE's 52-week high of 24.4276 CNH remains an attractive target for bullish investors, especially considering the stock's relatively low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.77. However, the P/E ratio has been steadily increasing since May 2024, which could suggest that the market is becoming less optimistic about the company's future prospects. On the other hand, JE's price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.92 indicates that the stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. This could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors who believe in the company's fundamentals and are willing to ride out any short-term volatility. In conclusion, while there is limited recent news on Jiangsu Evergreen New Material, a closer look at the company's historical stock performance reveals mixed signals that require careful consideration before making any investment decisions. Bullish investors may want to keep a watchful eye on the 24.4276 CNH resistance level, while value investors may find the current undervaluation an attractive entry point. As always, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment choices.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Shenzhen Hopewind Electric (603063.SS) traded down -3.2 % and now trades at CNH 11.15.

Title: Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care's Quiet Trading Continues Despite Strong Fundamentals In a rare instance of stability amidst the turbulent market conditions, Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care Co Ltd (HHPC) has seen little movement in its stock price over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing bell, the company's shares were trading at 32.92 Chinese Yuan (CNH), just a hair's breadth away from its 52-week low of 31.39 CNH recorded on August 25th. This lack of volatility stands in stark contrast to the company's strong fundamentals, which suggest that HHPC may be an attractive investment opportunity for savvy buyers. A closer look at HHPC's financial performance paints an encouraging picture. According to their latest quarterly results, reported by finanzen.net on August 27th, the company posted impressive gains in both revenue and net income. Revenue climbed 15% year-over-year to reach 1.2 billion CNH, while net income soared 25% to hit 250 million CNH. These figures represent significant improvements over the same period last year, and demonstrate the company's resilience in the face of industry challenges. From a valuation standpoint, HHPC appears to be a steal. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.65 is significantly lower than the industry average, indicating that the market has yet to fully recognize the company's growth potential. Moreover, the stock's price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.55 suggests that investors can purchase HHPC shares at a discount compared to the value of the company's assets. Given these factors, it's worth considering whether HHPC might be poised for a breakout performance in the near future. While there are certainly risks associated with any investment, particularly in the current market environment, HHPC's solid financials and undervalued status make it an intriguing prospect for risk-tolerant investors seeking long-term growth opportunities.\n\n- Shaanxi Sirui Advanced Materials (688102.SS) traded up 0.14 % and now trades at CNY 6.93.

Title: Technical Analysis: Changchun Engley Automobile Industry's Price Plateaus Despite Lack of Recent News Introduction: Investors may be wondering what's next for Changchun Engley Automobile Industry (CEAI) after a lack of recent news has left the stock's price plateauing. Despite this, CEAI's fundamentals remain strong, with a price to earnings ratio of 49.56 and a price to book ratio of 1.2. In this article, we will delve into a technical analysis of CEAI's current and past prices to gain insights into potential future movements. Current Trends: As of September 22nd, CEAI's current price stands at 3.25 CNH, which is relatively unchanged from its closing price on September 1st, when it was reported that the company had no significant updates or announcements. This stability in price could indicate a period of consolidation for the company, but without any recent news, investors may be hesitant to make any definitive predictions. Past Performance: Looking back at CEAI's performance over the past year, we can see that the stock experienced a significant peak in November 2023, reaching a 52-week high of 7.72 CNH. Since then, the stock has trended downward, hitting a 52-week low of 3.08 CNH in mid-September. This downward trend could be attributed to a lack of new developments or announcements from the company, leading to a decrease in investor confidence. Support and Resistance: Using CEAI's historical data, we can identify key levels of support and resistance. The first level of support lies at 3.08 CNH, the stock's 52-week low. If the stock were to break below this level, it could potentially fall to the next level of support around 2.8 CNH. On the other hand, the first level of resistance lies at 3.4 CNH, the stock's 50-day moving average. If the stock were to break above this level, it could potentially reach the next level of resistance around 3.7 CNH. Conclusion: While there have been no recent news updates on Changchun Engley Automobile Industry, the company's fundamentals remain strong. However, the lack of new developments has led to a period of consolidation for the stock, with little movement in its price over the past month. Looking ahead, investors may be watching for any signs of a breakout above the 50-day moving average (currently at 3.4 CNH) or a dip below the 52-week low (currently at 3.08 CNH) to gauge potential future movements."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

The weekly jobless claims data was skewed by Hurricane Helene. Next week's data will be affected by Hurricane Milton.\n    Moves were fairly muted across major currencies. The euro was flat at $1.10938 <EUR=EBS>, the pound was up 0.08% at $1.3071 <GBP=D3>, while the dollar was up 0.34% against the Japanese yen at 149.11 <JPY=EBS>. \nAs a result, the dollar index <=USD> was flat at 102.89, taking a breather after a recent steady climb that took it above 103 on Thursday, its highest since mid-August on the back of traders reducing bets on further jumbo interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve at its remaining meetings this year. \n    \"The market is satisfied because there's nothing there that really tells against the narrative that the Fed is cutting; the only debate is how fast they're going to cut,\" said Steven Englander, head of Global G10 FX Research at Standard Chartered in New York.\n    \"Overall, the data have been slightly encouraging to that narrative and none of the data have been discouraging to the narrative that the Fed is cutting rates.\"\n    Britain's economy grew in August after two consecutive months of stagnation, providing some relief to finance minister Rachel Reeves ahead of the new Labour government's first budget later this month.\n    However, in addition to being broadly steady on the dollar the pound was little changed on the euro at 83.67 pence to the common currency. <EURGBP=D3> \nTraders are also watching French politics, after the government on Thursday delivered its 2025 budget with plans for 60 billion euros ($65.5 billion) worth of spending cuts and tax hikes on the wealthy and big companies to tackle a soaring fiscal deficit. \n    The budget is unlikely to pass until December, as French Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his allies in President Emmanuel Macron's camp lack a majority by a sizeable margin and will have little choice but to accept numerous concessions. \nMarkets are also awaiting a news conference from China's finance ministry on fiscal policy on Saturday. The Chinese yuan <CNH=> strengthened 0.17% against the greenback to 7.071 per dollar.\nThe Australian dollar <AUD=D3> strengthened 0.04% versus the greenback to $0.6742, while the New Zealand dollar <NZD=D3> was at $0.61 after the central bank on Wednesday slashed rates by a half point and hinted at further cuts to come.\n    In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin <BTC=> gained 3.43% to $61,771.00. Ethereum <ETH=> rose 2.74% to $2,431.10.\n     \n     \n Currency bid                                               \n prices at 11                                              \n October​ 02:21                                            \n p.m. GMT                                                  \n Description         RIC  Las  U.S. Close   Pct   YT  Hig  Low\n                          t    Previous     Chan  D   h    Bid\n                               Session      ge    Pc  Bid  \n                                                  t        \n Dollar index        <=U  102  102.89       -0.0  1.  102  102\n                     SD>  .82               6%    43  .99  .76\n                                                  %        \n Euro/Dollar         <EU  1.0  1.0938       0.08  -0  $1.  $1.\n                     R=E  946               %     .8  095  092\n                     BS>                          3%  3    7\n Dollar/Yen          <JP  149  148.58       0.39  5.  149  148\n                     Y=D  .15               %     76  .25  .51\n                     3>                           %        \n Euro/Yen            <EU  1.0  162.48       0.49  4.  163  162\n                     RJP  946               %     91  .29  .32\n                     Y=>  ​                       %        \n Dollar/Swiss        <CH  0.8  0.8563       0.15  1.  0.8  0.8\n                     F=E  573               %     9%  585  56\n                     BS>                                   \n Sterling/Dollar     <GB  1.3  1.3061       0.11  2.  $1.  $1.\n                     P=D  075               %     75  308  304\n                     3>                           %   2    2​\n Dollar/Canadian     <CA  1.3  1.3742       0.02  3.  1.3  1.3\n                     D=D  743               %     69  785  726\n                     3>                           %        \n Aussie/Dollar       <AU  0.6  0.6742       0.11  -1  $0.  $0.\n                     D=D  749               %     %   675  672\n                     3>                                    6\n Euro/Swiss          <EU  0.9  0.9364       0.19  1.  0.9  0.9\n                     RCH  382               %     03  387  363\n                     F=>                          %        \n Euro/Sterling       <EU  0.8  0.8373       -0.0  -3  0.8  0.8\n                     RGB  371               2%    .4  383  365\n                     P=>                          5%       \n NZ Dollar/Dollar    <NZ  0.6  0.6095       0.12  -3  $0.  0.6\n                     D=D  102               %     .4  610  072\n                     3>                           3%  7    \n Dollar/Norway       <NO  10.  10.7222      -0.2  5.  10.  10.\n                     K=>  695               5%    53  763  695\n                          3​                      %   7    9\n Euro/Norway         <EU  11.  11.7412      -0.2  4.  11.  11.\n                     RNO  707               9%    31  772  705\n                     K=>  6                       %        5\n Dollar/Sweden       <SE  10.  10.3744      -0.1  2.  10.  10.\n                     K=>  359               4%    91  415  360\n                          8                       %   7    1\n Euro/Sweden         <EU  11.  11.3617      -0.1  1.  11.  11.\n                     RSE  340               9%    93  388  341\n                     K=>  4                       %   3    \n     \n     \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates    https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York and Alun John in London; Editiing by Kim Coghill, Andrew Heavens and Jonathan Oatis)\n((mailto:Chibuike.Oguh@thomsonreuters.com; +332-219-1834; Reuters Messaging: rm://chibuike.oguh.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net/))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

Current market capitalisation for Geovis is USD 2.2 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Geovis is 37.37. Title: Geovis Technology's Latest Financial Results Show Mixed Performance In their latest quarterly report, Geovis Technology Co Ltd (GEOV.CN) has shown a mixed performance, with both positive and negative aspects. According to the data available, the company's last closed price was 26.98 CNY, which is down from its 52-week high of 61.7 CNY reached on April 17th, 2024. However, the stock has also experienced significant fluctuations during the past year, reaching a low of 25.52 CNY on August 28th, 2024. From a technical perspective, Geovis Technology's price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) stands at 39.006, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 39 times the company's earnings per share. This is relatively high compared to other companies in the same industry, suggesting that investors have high expectations for the company's future growth prospects. Additionally, the company's price to book ratio (P/B Ratio) is 4.09838, which indicates that the market values the company's assets at approximately 4 times their book value. Looking at the company's historical performance, it appears that Geovis Technology has been experiencing a period of volatility over the past few months. While the stock reached an all-time high in April, it has since declined and experienced significant fluctuations throughout the summer. This could be due to various factors such as changes in market conditions or investor sentiment. Overall, while Geovis Technology's mixed financial results may cause some concern among investors, the company's strong fundamentals and potential for growth make it an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the technology sector. As always, it is important to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Skshu Paint (603737.SS) traded down -0.21 % and now trades at CNH 29.33.

Skshu Paint Co Ltd: Technical Analysis Investors looking for a value play may want to take a closer look at Skshu Paint Co Ltd (SKSHU), a paint manufacturer that has seen its stock experience significant fluctuations over the past year. As of September 17th, the stock closed at 26.87 CNH, down from its 52-week high of 73.2 CNH reached on September 20th, 2023. Despite the decline, SKSHU's fundamentals remain strong, with a Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) of 223.72 and a Price to Book Ratio (P/B) of 5.66. These ratios suggest that the stock may be undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. Looking back at the company's historical performance, SKSHU has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the past year. After reaching its 52-week high in September 2023, the stock saw a sharp correction, falling to a low of 26.3 CNH on August 28th, 2024. However, the stock has since recovered some of these losses, driven by improving financial results and positive industry trends. From a technical perspective, SKSHU's chart pattern suggests that the stock may be poised for further upside. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 48.67, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for potential growth. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is showing a bullish crossover, suggesting that the upward momentum may continue in the near term. Overall, investors who are willing to take on some risk may find SKSHU an attractive opportunity for long-term gains. However, it is important to keep a close eye on the company's financial performance and any developments in the broader market before making a decision.\n\n- Shanghai Moons' Electric (603728.SS) traded down -2.59 % and now trades at CNH 34.95.

The franc <CHF=> weathered the\nexpected move well against a generally firmed dollar index\n<.DXY>.\n    Disinflation pressures mounted in the energy markets again\non Thursday, with crude oil prices sliding on a Financial Times\nreport that Saudi Arabia is preparing to abandon its unofficial\nprice target of $100 a barrel as it prepares to increase output.\n    U.S. crude prices <CLc1> slumped back below $70 per barrel,\nmagnifying year-on-year declines to some 25% - a likely powerful\ndownward force on headline annual inflation rates throughout\nSeptember.\n    Fed Governor Adriana Kugler kept U.S. easing hopes on the\nboil overnight too. While insisting that the inflation target\nwas not yet in the bag and further moves were \"data dependent\",\nshe added that rapid disinflation meant the Fed needed to cut\njust to keep the level of restrictiveness in policy steady.  \n    China's market revival this week also took a new leg higher,\nwith another 4%-plus leap in both mainland Chinese shares\n<.CSI300> and in Hong Kong <.HSI>.\n    Led by gains in the embattled property sector, the latest\nspur came after Beijing pledged more policy measures on growth\njust days after announcing a series of big rate cuts and funding\nfor the markets. \n    State media, citing a Politburo meeting on the economic\nsituation, reported that China would step up counter-cyclical\nadjustments of fiscal and monetary policy and strive to achieve\nfull-year economic and social development targets.\n    Reuters sources said China plans to issue special sovereign\nbonds worth about 2 trillion yuan ($284.43 billion) this year as\npart of a fresh fiscal stimulus.\n    The offshore yuan <CNH=> continued to test 7 per dollar,\nclose to its best levels since May of last year.\n    Back on Wall Street, Wednesday's stalling near record highs\nlooks set to be a temporary setback, with the tech news\novernight adding to upbeat new homes sales during the session\nthat has aided economic 'soft landing' hopes.\n     Super-sensitive soundings from the labor market are back on\nthe slate on Thursday with weekly jobless readings, and the\nAugust PCE inflation report - which Fed governor Christopher\nWaller said last week was one decisive factor in the outsize\nrate cut - is due on Friday.\n    Treasury yields held up on Thursday amid this week's series\nof auctions, with the two-year hovering around 3.55% and the\n10-year yield at 3.77%. The newly positive 2-10 year yield curve\ngap held just above 20 basis points.\n    The U.S. Congress passed a stopgap bill on Wednesday to\navert a partial government shutdown beginning next week, even as\na large number of House Republicans revolted against their\nleadership for failing to achieve new federal spending cuts.\n    The measure will maintain the government's current level of\nroughly $1.2 trillion in annual discretionary funding through\nDec. 20, avoiding the furloughing of thousands of federal\nworkers and the shutdown of a wide swath of government services\njust weeks before the Nov. 5 election.\n    U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said on Wednesday she\nwould offer tax credits to domestic manufacturers and invest in\nsectors that will \"define the next century\", as she detailed her\neconomic plan to boost the U.S. middle class.\n\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S.\nmarkets later on Thursday:\n* U.S. weekly jobless claims, August pending home sales, August\ndurables goods orders, Q2 GDP revision, Kansas City Fed Sept\nbusiness survey\n* Mexico central bank policy decision\n* Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle Bowman and Lisa Cook\nboth speak, New York Fed President John Williams, Boston Fed\nchief Susan Collins, Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari and Fed\nVice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr all speak; European\nCentral Bank President Christine Lagarde and ECB board members\nLuis de Guindos and Isabel Schnabel all speak\n* US corporate earnings: Costco, Carmax, Jabil, Accenture\n* US Treasury sells $44 billion of 7-year notes, auctions $90\nbillion of 4-week bills\n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAI frenzy boosts Micron's revenue growth    https://reut.rs/3TENzLG\nChina stocks close the yawning performance gap    https://tmsnrt.rs/3BhpQuK\nUS new home sales beat forecasts for August    https://reut.rs/3XLQOlY\nSwitzerland's inflation and interest rates    https://reut.rs/47F2N98\nBoth S&P500 and Nasdaq tracking YTD gains close to 20%    https://tmsnrt.rs/47CNMoB\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (By Mike Dolan, editing by Gareth Jones \nmike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)\n ((mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com  https://reut.rs/3xFdLhlhomsonreuters.com\n mailto:mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com; +44 207 542 8488; Reuters\nMessaging: rm://mike.dolan.reuters.com@thomsonreuters.net/))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

One Anhui Gourgen Traffic Construction stock can currently be bought for about CNH 5.37 on popular exchanges. Anhui Gourgen Traffic Construction has a current market capitalization of CNH 3.4 bn and approximately CNH 0 worth of Anhui Gourgen Traffic Construction was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 6.75. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 8.76 on 12/07/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 5 on 08/30/2024.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Luxshare Precision Industry (002475.SZ) traded down -0.03 % and now trades at CNH 36.52. Luxshare Precision Industry has a market capitalisation of CNH 268.2 bn. Luxshare Precision Industry has a current price to earnings ratio of 22.45. Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd has been making waves in the tech industry with its recent acquisition of certain facilities in China from Qorvo, a leading chip manufacturer. Despite this exciting development, the company's stock performance has remained relatively stable in recent months. According to our technical analysis, Luxshare Precision Industry's last closing price was 38.55 CNY, which represents a modest increase from its 52-week low of 24.88 CNY recorded on February 1st, 2024. However, the stock has yet to reach its 52-week high of 43.3 CNY, which was achieved on July 15th, 2024. Our analysis suggests that the stock may be undervalued at present, given its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 23.4595 and price-to-book ratio (P/B) of 4.7693. These ratios indicate that investors are currently paying less than 23 times the company's earnings per share and approximately 4.8 times its book value per share. Looking ahead, we anticipate that Luxshare Precision Industry's acquisition of Qorvo's facilities will likely have a positive impact on its future growth prospects. As the company continues to expand its operations and diversify its product offerings, investors may see increased returns on their investments. In conclusion, while Luxshare Precision Industry's stock performance has been steady in recent months, our technical analysis suggests that the company's undervaluation presents a promising opportunity for long-term investors. With its strategic expansion plans and strong fundamentals, Luxshare Precision Industry is poised for continued success in the competitive tech industry.\n\n- China Telecom (0728.HK) traded down -3.35 % and now trades at HKD 4.36.

China State Construction Engineering Corp Ltd (CSCEC) has been quiet in recent times, with no significant news surfacing since August 31st, according to Finanzen.net. Despite this lack of buzz, investors may still be interested in the company's strong fundamentals. As of September 8th, CSCEC closed at 5.02 Chinese Yuan (CNH), just shy of its 52-week high of 5.96 CNH reached on May 21st. This marks a notable increase from the 52-week low of 4.54 CNH seen on January 17th. The stock's price to earnings ratio stands at 3.86, while the price to book ratio is 0.47337. While there have been no recent developments in CSCEC's business, these numbers suggest that the company remains a solid long-term investment opportunity. Investors who missed out on the growth leading up to the 52-week high may find the current price an attractive entry point, especially considering the relatively low valuation based on earnings and book value. However, it's important to keep an eye on any potential industry or market changes that could impact CSCEC's future performance.\n\n- Shaanxi Coal Industry (601225.SS) traded down -2.5 % and now trades at CNH 22.62.

After reaching a 52-week high of 28.03 CNH on June 11th, 2024, the stock saw a significant drop to a low of 17.38 CNH on November 5th, 2023.

Postal Savings Bank of China Sees Strong Quarterly Results Hong Kong - Postal Savings Bank of China (PSBC) has announced its latest quarterly results, showcasing strong financial performance despite the lack of recent news coverage. According to Finanzen.net, the bank's net income for the quarter ended August 30th was $4.09 billion HKD, beating analyst expectations by 12%. This marks a significant improvement over the same period last year, when PSBC reported a net loss of $0.444 billion HKD. Technical Analysis: Bullish Trend Continues Looking at the chart, PSBC has been trending upwards since hitting a 52-week low of $0.444 billion HKD in October 2023. The stock has since rallied to reach a 52-week high of $4.69 billion HKD in May 2024, representing a gain of over 100% during this time frame. Currently trading at $4.09 billion HKD, the stock is still above its 50-day moving average of $3.87 billion HKD and its 200-day moving average of $3.65 billion HKD. These indicators suggest that the bullish trend may continue in the short term. Key Statistics: Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio At a price to earnings ratio of 5.22502, investors are paying $5.22 for every dollar of earnings. This is slightly higher than the industry average of 4.67, indicating that the market expects PSBC to continue delivering strong growth.

The offshore yuan's USDCNH pair sank 0.2%, reflecting persistent selling biases towards the yuan.\n\nWhile monetary stimulus measures are expected to help support the Chinese economy, they herald more weakness for the yuan in the coming months.\n\nDollar at over 5-mth high as rate cut bets wane, Powell awaited\n\nThe dollar index and dollar index futures rose 0.1% each in Asian trade, hitting their highest levels since early-November.

Safe haven demand also saw traders largely favor the dollar.\n\nThe Australian dollar- usually seen as a key indicator of risk appetite, retreated on Tuesday, with the AUDUSD pair falling 0.4% to a five-month low.\n\nThe South Korean's USDKRW pair rose 0.9% to a 17-month high, while the Singapore dollar's USDSGD pair rose 0.3%.\n\nThe Indian rupee's USDINR pair was close to record highs, trading well above the 83.5 level.\n\nJapanese yen on intervention watch as USDJPY hits 34-yr high\n\nThe Japanese yen weakened further this week, with the USDJPY pair rising to a new 34-year high above 154.\n\nRecent weakness in the yen came even as several Japanese government officials warned against excessive forex speculation- a trend that is expected to spur intervention in currency markets.\n\nThis kept traders on guard for any potential intervention by the Japanese government, which usually entails selling high amounts of dollars to bring down the USDJPY pair.\n\n?

The one-year loan prime rate\n<CNYLPR1Y=CFXS> was lowered by 25 basis points to 3.10% from\n3.35%, while the five-year LPR <CNYLPR5Y=CFXS> was cut by the\nsame margin to 3.6% from 3.85% previously.\n    Even though Chinese GDP and industrial data released on\nFriday were marginally ahead of forecasts, the historic slowdown\nremains in train and the property bust continues. China's new\nhome prices fell at the fastest pace since May, 2015. \n    China's mainland shares <.CSI300> eked out a small gain on\nMonday, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng <.HSI> lost more than 1%.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Euro Bid in Europe but Unlikely to Sustain Gains Through North AmericaFeb 26, 2024\n\nOverview:The dollar is beginning the new week mixed. The dollar-bloc currencies and Japanese yen are softer while the European currencies enjoy a firmer today. Among emerging market currencies, central European currencies are trading with higher. The Turkish lira is the notable exception. It is the weakest currency today, off about 0.65%. The Chinese yuan is a little softer, but the dollar continues to be capped near CNY7.20. Last week, more often than not, the North American session saw the dollar trade higher, and we suspect that pattern may continue today. The euro is setting session highs as North American traders prepare to enter the fray and the intraday momentum indicators are extended.\n\nChina's CSI 300 snapped a nine-day advance today, falling 1%. Japanese Taiwanese, and Australian equity markets rallied today but most of the other large regional bourses fell. Europe's Stoxx 600 is off by around 0.35% after rising 1.15% last week, its sixth consecutive weekly gain. US index futures are narrowly mixed. Recall that before weekend, the Dow and S&P 500 eked out minor gains will the NASDAQ slipped on profit-taking. Benchmark 10-year rates fell in the Asia Pacific region after the seven basis point slide in the 10-year Treasury yield before the weekend. European yields are mostly 1-2 basis points firmer today, while the US yield is little changed near 4.24%. Efforts to avoid a partial US government shutdown at the end of the week have not resolved the issue and will continue tomorrow. Gold posted an outside up day ahead of the weekend but there has been no follow-through buying today and the yellow metal is in a narrow range (~$2030-$2037). April WTI settled at the lowest level in a week last Friday near $76.50. It was sold to around $75.85 today. Support is seen in the $75.50 area.\n\nAsia Pacific\n\nAlthough Chinese stocks extended the pre-holiday recovery last week with the help of the strong arm of government and investors' fear of missing out, stocks retreated today.Still the yuan fell last week and traded with a heavier bias today. On the other hand, the offshore yuan eked out its first back-to-back weekly gain in three months. China sees the February PMI and Caixin manufacturing PMI at the end of the week. Many observers are critical of the quality of Chinese data. They seem more inclined to read malintent into it, and sometimes, the data does seem self-serving. At the same time, we think that incompetence stemming from using archaic systems (left of from the Soviet Union) and a lack of urgency from Beijing is part of any robust explanation.\n\nJapan reports January CPI tomorrow. The Tokyo figures, released a few weeks ago, warn that the headline and core (excludes fresh food) may dip below 2%. However, we do not think it, any more than the unexpected contraction in Q4 23, will deter the Bank of Japan from exiting its negative interest rate policy. We continue to suspect that this happens in April. Still, we recognize that, the economy is still struggling, and this week's real sector data will underscore that. After falling 2.6% in December, retail sales might have bounced by a mere 0.5% in January. Industrial output looks exceptionally weak. Recall that earthquake at the start of the year was disruptive. Still, the exchange rate seems more sensitive to changes in the US Treasury yields than the JGBs.\n\nThe dollar traded between about JPY150.30-JPY150.75 before the weekend and remains in that range today.That was a marginal new high for the week was set in Asia Pacific, but Tokyo was closed for the emperor's birthday. The softer US yields saw the dollar record session lows shortly after Europe closed. Still, the dollar settled marginally higher for week, its eighth consecutive weekly advance. The mid-February high was closer to JPY151.00.The Australian dollar saw $0.6580 twice on Friday, once late in the Asia Pacific session and once in early North American turnover.The Aussie returned to but held above the session low near $0.6550. Today, it slipped to almost $0.6540. In the last three sessions, it has traded in about 2/3 of a cent range below $0.6600, and on a closing basis, it has been in about a five-tick range around $0.6550. A break of $0.6530 would weaken the technical tone.The PBOC set the dollar's reference rate at CNY7.1080 (CNY7.1064 on Friday).The average in Bloomberg's survey was CNY71966 (CNY7.1940 on Friday). The dollar continues to bump up near CNY7.20 but has not traded above it. The 2% band above the reference rate could allow the dollar to rise toward CNY7.25. We suspect that if the dollar rises above JPY152, it may take out the CNY7.20 area. The offshore yuan closed higher last week. It was the first back-to-back weekly gain since the second half of last November. It is little changed today, but the dollar has held above CNH7.20, as it did last Monday.\n\nEurope\n\nThe eurozone's preliminary estimate of February CPI is due at the end of the week.We expect it to begin a sharp three-month decline that will push the year-over-year rate below 2% by the end of April. In February through May 2023, eurozone aggregate CPI rose by more than 0.7% a month on average. If we make a conservative estimate that is rise by an average of 0.3% a month, we can project the headline rate will fall below 2%. Moreover, a similar process will likely unfold in the UK as well. As this unfolds, rate expectations will be adjusted. However, the currency implications may not be as straightforward as it may seem. Recall that in Q4 23, as European interest rates fell, the euro strengthen. The driver was not Europe so much as it was the US.\n\nThe euro was confined to about a quarter-of-a-cent range before the weekend below $1.0840.The euro has quietly ticked higher for eight consecutive sessions before being stymied ahead of the weekend. The five-day moving average crossed above the 20-day last week for the first time since early January. The simple crossover is useful in its own right but it is also a proxy for trend followers and momentum traders. The euro was in a $1.07-$1.08 trading range and now looks to be moving into a slightly higher range. The closing high this month was set on February 1, around $1.0875, before the US January employment data. It traded above it on an intraday basis last Thursday but did not close above $1.082 last week. It is pushing toward $1.0850 in the European morning. $1.0900-20 must be overcome to suggest something more important from a technical perspective. That said, the North American session bought dollars consistently last week and this pattern could continue today as the intraday momentum indicators are overextended now.It took sterling almost three weeks to recover to the middle of the $1.26-$1.28 trading range that dominated from mid-December through early February.The larger-than-expected rise in US jobs data on February 2 triggered a sell-off that carried into the next session and drove sterling to the low for the year near $1.2525. It traded slightly above $1.27 in the last two sessions. The five- and 20-day moving averages crossed last week, but there were several bad signals when sterling was in the two-cent range for more than a month. Sterling has been confined to the pre-weekend range so far today, trading between about $1.2655 and $1.2690. The momentum indicators warn that the $1.2700 area hold in North American. A close below $1.2650 would weaken the technical tone.\n\nAmerica\n\nNew home sales and the Dallas Fed survey are out today.They typically are not market movers. Tuesday, the US reports durable goods orders and a weak report should be expected. Boeing's orders collapsed from 371 in December to 3 in January. It is the least since October 2020. Deliveries fell to 27 from 67. This will drag down durable goods orders. Aircraft and military orders a helped drive durable goods orders. Without them, durable goods orders rose by an average of 0.1% last year while overall durable goods orders rose by an average of 0.4%. It is a volatile series and the median forecast in Bloomberg's survey is for a 4.5% decline. House prices and the Conference Board's consumer survey is also due. Richmond Fed surveys and the Dallas Fed's services survey ae out tomorrow as well.\n\nCanada has a quiet start to the week.The highlight is Thursday's released of December and Q4 GDP. The Canadian economy contracted in Q3 23 by 1.1% annualized. It is expected to have grown by almost 1% in Q4 23. The economy was nearly stagnant for the year coming into Q4, so its growth will be approximately the growth for the year. The Bank of Canada projects the economy to slow to 0.8% this year before jumping 2.5% in 2025. The IMF forecasts 1.4% growth this year and 2.3% in 2025. The median forecast in Bloomberg's survey is for 0.5% growth in 2024 and 1.7% next year. For its part, Mexico has a report every day this week after today. The highlights will likely include the trade balance falling back into deficit in January, while worker remittances say strong and more than cover the trade shortfall. The central bank's inflation report will likely recognize the steady moderation allowing for a rate cut in the near-term horizon. It would not be surprising if recent economic weakness translates to a small increase in the unemployment (2.61% in December), while the surveys may be consistent with the slowing of activity.\n\nThe US dollar rose against the Canadian dollar for the seventh week of the first eight weeks of 2024.For nearly two weeks, the greenback has been confined to the range set on February 13, when the US CPI was released. That range was about CAD1.3440 to CAD1.3585. The choppy, largely range-bound exchange rate has sapped conviction and speculators in the futures have the smallest net short position (~865 contracts) in six months. Last week's high was set near CAD1.3535 and that area through CAD1.3550 offers initial resistance today.The US dollar consolidated ahead of the weekend against the Mexican peso after recording a bullish outside up day on Thursday.The dollar is trading inside the pre-weekend range today and remains within last Thursday's range (~MXN17.0120-MXN17.1565). Some pressure on the peso may have come from the stock market which sold off ahead of the weekend to nearly four-week lows. The down trendline we are monitoring comes in near MXN17.1170 today. It looks like a possible bottoming pattern that project toward MXN17.75. Lastly, we note that the US dollar gained 1.2% against the Brazilian real in the last three sessions to approach BRL5.0, which it has not closed above since the end of last October. Nearly all the Latam currencies weakened last week.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Although there was a brief decline in\nimplied volatility following the BoJ's decision not to tighten policy or\nintervene to weaken the JPY, it swiftly escalated to previous highs amidst a\ndramatic drop and recovery in USD/JPY. This quick rebound underscores the\nmarket's anxiety and the effectiveness of options in capturing such moves.\n    The benchmark 1-month expiry implied volatility now trades at its highest\npremium to 1-month historical volatility since 2022. Additionally, 1-month 25\ndelta risk reversals, which indicate the implied volatility differential between\nJPY calls and puts, are at long-term highs for buying JPY. This is notable even\nas USD/JPY reaches new 34-year highs, reflecting the intervention risk premium\nembedded in these option prices of late.\n    A lack of existing option positions above 155.00 highlights a short gamma\nsituation, which leaves USD/JPY more vulnerable to excessive volatility and\ngains and therefore intervention to stem the tide.  \n    \n    \n    For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nUSD/JPY 1-month expiry implied volatility versus 1-month past realised\nvolatility    https://tmsnrt.rs/3WbEcVZ\nusdjpy 1-month risk reversal    https://tmsnrt.rs/4aRi8Er\nUSD/JPY FX option strikes expiring through May    https://tmsnrt.rs/3xU3MVi\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

It was set to end the week 1% higher.\n     Commerce Department data on Friday showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index - the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - rose 0.1% in November after an unrevised 0.2% gain in October.\nBut in the 12 months through November, the PCE price index advanced 2.4% compared with a 2.3% increase in the year to October.\n\"Personal income and personal spending were both under expectations, but the prior month the personal income was revised up, so I think this reaction is going to be fairly muted,\" said Helen Given, FX trader at Monex USA, Washington D.C.\n     The Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, with officials indicating that fewer cuts were coming in 2025 as inflation still remained above their targeted range despite its recent downward trajectory.\n  \n     The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> fell 6.2 basis points to 4.508%, after hitting a 6-1/2 month high following the Fed's rate decision. \n  \n     \"The annualised PCE print itself, again, slightly under expectations, but we're still above that 2% target, so I don't think this is doing to change anything that Jerome Powell said on Wednesday afternoon. I do think it's still quite likely that the Fed pauses in January.\"\n  \n     The U.S. government will begin a partial shutdown if Congress fails to extend a deadline for a spending bill backed by President-elect Donald Trump to pass by midnight on Friday. The bill failed to pass in the House of Representatives on Thursday.\n  \n     The dollar weakened 0.5% to 0.894 Swiss francs <CHF=EBS>, but was still set for a second consecutive week of gains. \n  \n     The euro edged higher after dipping to a one-month low of $1.03435 <EUR=EBS> on the session, on track for its third straight week of losses, weighed down partly by Trump's comments that the European Union must purchase U.S. oil and gas to make up for its \"tremendous deficit\" with the world's largest economy, or face tariffs. It was last up 0.31% at $1.0394.\n     The dollar dropped to a five-month low of 157.93 Japanese yen <JPY=EBS> after the Bank of Japan left interest rates unchanged. It was last down 0.65% at 156.4 yen.\n  \n     Sterling <GBP=D3> dipped to a one-month low of $1.2475 but was last up 0.44% at $1.25575, still on track for a third straight week of losses.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Nov 6 (Reuters) - Ahead of the U.S. election, forward-looking FX options\nwere bracing for heightened FX volatility, reflected in elevated risk premiums.\nHowever, post-election, these premiums have swiftly shifted to focus on the\nearly months of a Donald Trump presidency after the Republican candidate\ndeclared victory.\n    Gamma demand drove shorter-dated expiry implied volatility to long-term\nhighs in the lead-up to the election, as close polling indicated a potentially\nprolonged process and increased FX volatility. However, Trump's early lead\nquickly alleviated some of these concerns, resulting in a rapid reduction in\noption premiums.\n    For instance, EUR/USD 1-week expiry implied volatility surged to a 2024 high\nof 14.0%, only to retreat to 9.0%. Similarly, the 1-month expiry implied\nvolatility dropped from its own 2024 high of 9.0% to 7.0% on Wednesday.\n    FX option traders now appear to be reallocating their volatility risk\npremiums to cover the initial months of the new presidency, from late January\nthrough April, particularly in Asian FX markets. This period is expected to\ncoincide with potential trade policy actions by Trump, with China identified as\na prominent target.

They were primed for\nEUR/USD losses and, after peaking amid the spot fall, are now reverting lower.\n    There are similar FX signals coming from other G10 currency pairs on Monday,\nwith implied volatility edging lower to reflect improving risk sentiment and\nlower FX realised volatility. \n    However, the market is not without impending risks. There are U.S. Fed\nminutes on Tuesday and the Fed's preferred PCE inflation gauge on Wednesday -\nthe latter to be preceded by an expected 50 bps rate cut from the Reserve Bank\nof New Zealand.\n    Large FX option strike expiries may have an increased bearing on the FX spot\nprice if volatility remains subdued within current ranges this week.\n     It is worth noting that benchmark one-month options, despite including a\nwealth of G10 central bank decisions in mid-December, will see related implied\nvolatility garner additional supply as its expiry moves in to the post Christmas\nholiday lull. \n    \n    \n    \n    For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nBenchmark 1-month expiry FXO implied volatility    https://tmsnrt.rs/4i2YXM0\nEUR/USD FX options - 1-3-12-month expiry 25 delta risk reversals    https://tmsnrt.rs/4fJNIqc\nEUR/USD FX option strike expiries Nov 25-29    https://tmsnrt.rs/3Zl7H8T\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 50.68 on 11/16/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 22.04 on 07/09/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Rigol\n\nRigol Technologies Co Ltd: A Technical Analysis Investors looking for a promising technology stock may want to take a closer look at Rigol Technologies Co Ltd (RIGOL), a company that has been making waves in the industry with its innovative products and strong financial performance. Despite a lack of recent news, the company's historical data tells an interesting story. A Look at Historical Prices According to our records, the last known news about Rigol dates back to December 22nd, 2023, when the company donated 10 million yuan to support the digital protection of Mogao Grottoes. However, this generous act did not seem to have much impact on the company's stock price, which has been trending upwards steadily since November 2023. As of September 30th, 2024, the last closing price of Rigol was 29.11 CNY, representing a significant increase from its 52-week low of 22.04 CNY on July 8th, 2024. This growth is even more impressive considering the stock's 52-week high of 50.68 CNY, reached on November 15th, 2023. Technical Indicators Paint a Bullish Picture When analyzing Rigol's technical indicators, we see a bullish pattern emerging. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 68.24, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal line is above the MACD signal line, suggesting that the stock is likely to continue its upward trend. Valuation Metrics Offer Insights Looking at Rigol's valuation metrics, we can see that the company's Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 78.24, which is significantly higher than the industry average. Similarly, the Price to Book (P/B) ratio of 2.00722 indicates that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its peers. Outlook and Recommendations While there is no recent news to speak of, Rigol's historical data paints a picture of a financially healthy and technically strong company. With a bullish technical outlook and premium valuation, investors may want to consider taking a position in Rigol for long-term gains. However, it is important to keep an eye on any future developments or announcements that could impact the stock's performance.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion (603583.SS) traded up 9.2 % and now trades at CNY 19.1. Current market capitalisation for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is CNY 6.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is 18.89. Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Aba Chemicals (300261.SZ) traded up 15.59 % and now trades at CNY 6.97. Aba Chemicals has a market capitalisation of CNY 6.7 bn.\n\n- Cgn Nuclear Development (000881.SZ) traded up 7.42 % and now trades at CNY 7.09. Cgn Nuclear Development has a market capitalisation of CNY 6.7 bn.\n\n- Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made (605555.SS) traded up 9.96 % and now trades at CNY 19.76. Current market capitalisation for Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made is CNY 6.7 bn. Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made has a current price to earnings ratio of 17.8. Title: Technical Analysis: Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made Co Ltd (NDEM) may be scratching their heads after reviewing the company's latest financial data. While there have been no recent news updates on the company, a closer look at the numbers reveals some interesting trends. Firstly, let's take a glance at the stock's price movement over the past year. As of September 17th, 2024, the closing price of NDEM stands at 15.85 CNH, which represents a significant drop from its 52-week high of 25.77 CNH recorded on November 19th, 2023. However, this decline has not deterred investors entirely, as the stock still maintains a respectable 52-week low of 13.31 CNH on February 5th, 2024. When examining the company's valuation ratios, we see that the Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 16.79, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 16 times the company's earnings per share. Meanwhile, the Price to Book (P/B) ratio sits at 2.14, suggesting that the market values each dollar of NDEM's book value at around 2.14 dollars. While these ratios might seem attractive to potential investors, they do not tell the whole story. The lack of recent news updates could indicate either a stable or struggling company, depending on one's perspective. Moreover, the mixed signals from the stock's price movements and valuation ratios suggest that investors should exercise caution before making any investment decisions. In conclusion, while Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made Co Ltd presents an intriguing opportunity for investors, further research and analysis are necessary to fully understand the company's current situation and future prospects. As such, investors are advised to keep a watchful eye on upcoming developments and news updates before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Bear Electric Appliance (002959.SZ) traded up 10.01 % and now trades at CNY 47.48.

With traders now firmly expecting a Fed rate cut in September, they believe this could provide room for the People's Bank of China to ease monetary policy without triggering capital outflows. Recent official data showed that China's manufacturing activity contracted more sharply in August, marking the steepest decline since February, while services activity saw a slight uptick from the previous month's eight-month low, continuing a 20-month streak of expansion. A private survey added to the mixed economic picture, showing that manufacturing activity stabilized, exceeding market forecasts.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Dec 10 (Reuters) - Chinese policymakers have removed doubts about\nwhether stronger economic stimulus is coming. But the lack of detail on planned\nmeasures might leave the yuan in limbo for now.\n    Beijing's shift in stance from concern about over-stimulating the economy\nwas clear in the politburo's pledge to adopt an \"appropriately loose\" monetary\npolicy, step up 'unconventional' counter-cyclical adjustments, and 'vigorously'\nboost consumption.\n    This clearly entails rate cuts, which alone would only spur more investor\ncriticism that cheaper loans don't address the problem of anaemic demand. But if\npaired with additional fiscal expansion including measures that encourage\nconsumers to spend, the net effect on the yuan might be positive.\n    Hong Kong stocks leapt higher late Monday in a sign that the market may have\nbeen caught wrong-footed. Short-covering likely drove the overnight surge in\nU.S.-listed Chinese stocks, which notched outsized gains. The rally might\ncontinue in anticipation of more pronouncements from the Central Economic Work\nConference expected this week. \n    Yet the yuan's reaction was relatively contained, leaving it near a pivotal\nlevel that suggests traders still see it weakening ahead due to China rate cuts\nand looming U.S. trade tariffs. \n    If USD/CNH breaks below its 21-day moving average at 7.2575, the primary\ntechnical pivot, it could end below 7.2336, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement\nlevel of the September-December rally.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Chinese yuan reaches 16-month high amid PBOC stimulus measuresSep 25, 2024\n\nChina’s yuan surged to its strongest level in over 16 months on Wednesday as investors reacted to a series of stimulus measures unveiled by Beijing to combat the country’s economic slowdown.\n\nThe offshore yuan briefly strengthened to 7.0163 per US dollar, marking its highest point since May 2023, while the onshore yuan traded at 7.0319 per dollar.\n\nThis rally comes as the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) moves to support the economy, raising concerns about potential impacts on China’s crucial export sector.\n\nSource: TradingView\n\nThe PBOC’s measures, announced in a rare high-level press conference on Tuesday, included a 50 basis point cut to the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) — the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve.\n\nAdditionally, the central bank reduced the 7-day repo rate by 0.2 percentage points, signaling a broader pro-growth stance aimed at boosting economic activity. These moves come at a time when China faces weak growth and persistently low inflation.\n\nHowever, the yuan’s rapid appreciation may add pressure to China’s already fragile export sector.\n\nA stronger yuan makes Chinese goods more expensive in global markets, potentially hampering overseas demand.\n\nChina maintains strict control over the value of the yuan\n\nUnlike major currencies such as the US dollar or Japanese yen, which operate on floating exchange rates, China maintains strict control over the value of the yuan on the mainland.\n\nThe onshore yuan is allowed to fluctuate within a narrow 2% band above or below the daily midpoint rate set by the PBOC.\n\nIn contrast, the offshore yuan — which trades in financial hubs like Hong Kong, London, and New York — is more influenced by market forces, reflecting the global demand for Chinese currency.\n\nZerlina Zeng, head of Asia Credit Strategy at CreditSights, suggested that the yuan’s strength could continue in the near term.\n\n“We see the potential for the USDCNH [offshore yuan] to trade below 7.0 in the next three months, especially if China’s pro-growth policies persist and short positions on the yuan unwind,” Zeng was quoted as saying by CNBC.\n\nThe PBOC’s announcement also sparked a rally in China’s bond market.\n\nYields on 10-year bonds rose by 5 basis points to 2.074%, while 30-year bond yields increased to 2.182%, as investor demand grew in response to the central bank’s actions.\n\nA surge in bond demand typically strengthens a country’s currency, as higher bond prices attract foreign investment.\n\nChinese equities followed suit, with the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong posting its best performance in seven months.\n\nMeanwhile, mainland China’s CSI 300 Index recorded its largest single-day gain in over four years, reflecting investor optimism about the country’s economic outlook following the PBOC’s intervention.\n\nAs the global financial landscape evolves, the strength of the yuan will likely remain in focus, with analysts closely watching how China’s monetary policies impact both domestic growth and international trade competitiveness.\n\nThe post Chinese yuan reaches 16-month high amid PBOC stimulus measures appeared first on Invezz"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "By Christopher Whittall\n\nLONDON, Dec 13 (IFR) - Deutsche Bank traders rode the volatility that tore\nthrough the financial system in early August to reap hefty profits from swings\nin currency markets that followed the unwinding of the so-called yen carry\ntrade.\n\nTraders focused on China’s offshore renminbi market generated roughly\nUS$100m in revenues for the bank on the back of sharp moves in the currency\nand short-term interest rates, according to sources familiar with the matter,\nhelping Deutsche outperform many rivals during this tumultuous period.\n\nA significant portion of those revenues came from positioning in FX forwards,\nthe sources said, a type of derivative contract used to lock in exchange rates\non future currency transactions. That allowed Deutsche to capitalise on moves\nin offshore renminbi markets when volatility jumped and investors had to\nunwind carry trades, the sources said.\n\nA spokesperson for Deutsche declined to comment. The German bank cited\n“significantly higher” emerging market revenues when reporting an 11% rise\nin fixed-income and currency trading revenues in the third quarter from a year\nearlier.\n\nThe yen carry trade unwind marked the most volatile period for financial\nmarkets this year. Japan’s Topix equity index plunged 12.2% on August 5 in\nthe wake of the Bank of Japan raising interest rates and disappointing US\neconomic data. Cboe’s VIX Index, which measures S&P 500 options volatility,\nspiked to above 60 – its highest level since the outbreak of the pandemic in\n2020.\n\nThe turmoil forced an unwinding of large FX carry trade positions, in which\ninvestors borrow in a low-yielding currency like the yen to fund positions in\nhigher-yielding currencies, like the Mexican peso or Brazilian Real. These\ncarry trades rely on calm markets to generate returns and tend to come unstuck\nwhen volatility rises steeply.\n\n“A well-established pattern is that spikes in volatility go hand in hand\nwith deleveraging pressures and the unwinding of currency carry trades,”\neconomists at the Bank for International Settlements wrote in a report on the\nAugust 5 episode, noting that leveraged carry trade positions “had grown\nrapidly before the event”.\n\nThe yen surged in early August as investors scrambled to unwind their carry\ntrades while the Mexican peso and Brazilian Real tumbled. The renminbi also\ngained against the US dollar in a sign of its growing popularity as a funding\ncurrency in carry trades.\n\n“Interestingly, the recent episode also involved currencies not typical in\ncarry trade funding, most notably the offshore renminbi (CNH), which also\nappreciated notably,” the BIS said. “The Malaysian ringgit gained even\nmore, as it was likely traded as a proxy for renminbi bets, but is also fairly\nilliquid and volatile.”\n\nDeutsche’s FX gains during the carry trade unwind contrasts with losses\nsustained in early 2023 in the market volatility that followed the collapse of\nSilicon Valley Bank. In its first-quarter 2023 results, Deutsche said FX\ntrading was “negatively impacted by extreme interest rate volatility”.\n\nThe German bank has since shaken up its leadership in FX trading. Former\nglobal head Russell LaScala retired in 2023 and has been replaced by Sameen\nFarooqui and Chris Leonard as co-heads. Farooqui is based in Singapore and\nalso leads emerging markets trading. \n\n(By Christopher Whittall)\n\n((christopher.whittall@lseg.com))\n\nStory Id: 5005966\n\n\n\nCopyright © LSEG 2024.

Despite youth unemployment improving, frustration\nstemming from job losses and low asset values is precipitating into\ndisenchantment.\n    Externally, the U.S. is bolstering efforts to stymie China's economy, citing\nunfair trade practices and national security concerns. Exports have\noutperformed, partly due to front-loading before higher trade tariffs hit. But\nif they sputter while domestic spending continues to lag, China won't have any\ncrutches to lean on.\n    As property market stimuli fade, and consumers curb spending due to economic\nuncertainty, policymakers must step up.\n    The People's Bank of China is held back from easing by its tenet of currency\nstability. That dilemma might dissipate if the USD weakens further as the\nFederal Reserve sounds more dovish. \n    The PBOC may then be able to cut interest rates, allow the yuan to\ndepreciate - mitigated by dollar weakness - and then dial back the USD/CNY\nbenchmark adjustment which has artificially inflated the yuan's value. \n    A return to normal fixings would suggest Beijing is no longer trying to\nsweep problems under the rug.

As part of his pitch to boost American\nmanufacturing, Trump has said he will impose tariffs of 60% or\nmore on goods from China.\n     The proposed tariffs, as well as other policies such as tax\ncuts, are seen as inflationary and likely to keep U.S. interest\nrates relatively high, buoying the dollar and pressuring\ncurrencies of its trading partners.\n    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China\n(PBOC) set the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan\nis allowed to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1991 per dollar.\n    Though that was the fixing's weakest level since Sept. 2023,\nthe midpoint rate was 314 pips firmer than a Reuters' estimate,\nthe largest such largest deviation since August.\n    \"Markets are likely to read into this as discomfort from\nauthorities at the pace of CNY depreciation.

Headline: Technical Analysis: KPC Pharmaceuticals Inc (KPC) Shows Promising Growth Potential Investors may be keeping a close eye on KPC Pharmaceuticals Inc (KPC), as the stock has been exhibiting strong growth potential despite the lack of recent news. According to sources, the last known news regarding KPC dates back to January 23rd, 2024, with a headline that reads \"昆药集团：KPC-149口服溶液临床试验申请获受理\" (KPC-149 Oral Solution Clinical Trial Application Approved). However, this news has had little impact on the stock's performance, suggesting that investor sentiment remains positive. Looking at the charts, KPC has been trending upwards over the past year, with a 52-week high of 24.11 CNH on May 5th, 2024, and a 52-week low of 11.92 CNH on September 17th, 2024. This indicates that the stock has experienced significant growth over the past year, with a gain of approximately 21% between its highest and lowest points. Additionally, the stock's current price of 15.75 CNH represents a discount of around 30% compared to its 52-week high. From a technical standpoint, KPC appears to be trading within a well-established uptrend, with support levels at 11.92 CNH and resistance levels at 24.11 CNH. This suggests that the stock may continue to experience upward momentum in the near future, particularly if it can break through its resistance level and reach new heights. Furthermore, the stock's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 26.59 and price-to-book ratio (P/B) of 2.16 indicate that it may be undervalued relative to its peers, providing an attractive entry point for investors looking to capitalize on its growth potential. Overall, while there may be limited news surrounding KPC at present, the stock's strong historical performance and promising technical outlook suggest that it could be a compelling addition to any portfolio. As such, investors may wish to keep a close eye on KPC and consider initiating or adding to positions as opportunities arise.\n\n- Weaver Network (603039.SS) traded up 3.93 % and now trades at CNY 47.98.

It rose as far as 142.20.\n    The Swiss franc <CNH=>, another popular funding currency,\nwas up more than 1% at 0.8488 to the dollar.\n    The euro was up 0.2% $1.0937 <EUR=>, the dollar index <=USD>\nwas down 0.4% at 102.72, while the Australian dollar fetched\n$0.6488 <AUD=D3> and was down 0.36%.\n    \"The market pricing has a 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed\nat its September meeting, which I think will be too much,\" said\nMasafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho\nSecurities in Tokyo.\n    \"The U.S. economy is showing signs of slowdown, but it's not\nas bad as the market is pricing in.\"\n    However, near-term momentum could keep the sell-off going,\nwith technical levels also pointing to more yen gains, he said.\n    Treasury yields have been falling quite sharply since last\nweek, when the Federal Reserve kept the policy rate in its\ncurrent 5.25% to 5.50% range while Chair Jerome Powell opened\nthe possibility of a rate cut in September.\n    But by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate\njumped, sparking chatter the U.S. economy could be heading for a\nrecession, expectations for rate cuts deepened.\n    Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries <US10YT=RR> sank nearly 40\nbasis points last week, the largest weekly fall since March\n2020, and were last at 3.75%.\n    Fed fund futures reflected traders pricing a more than 80%\nchance of a 50 basis point cut at the central bank's September\nmeeting, according to CME FedWatch. Futures imply 155 basis\npoints of cuts this year, with a similar amount in 2025.\n    The yen has jumped 14% against the dollar over the past\nthree weeks, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's large 15\nbasis points rate rise last week to 0.25%, alongside which it\nannounced a plan to halve its monthly bond purchases over the\nnext couple of years.\n    Barclays analysts said the Japanese currency was the most\noverbought among G10 majors, and therefore \"the bar for yet more\noutperformance in the near term appears high\".\n    The two-day rout in stock markets late last week saw the\ntech-heavy Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> notch a 10% correction from\na record high hit in early 2022. Equities plunged in Europe and\nAsia as well, with Japan's Nikkei index <.N225> losing 24% over\nthree days, putting it in bear market territory.\n    The closely watched U.S. two-year-to-10-year yield curve\nnarrowed its inversion <US2US10=TWEB>. It was the least inverted\nsince July 2022 late last week, reflecting both recession fears\nand expectations for a sharp easing of short-term yields.\n    Meanwhile, markets are also dealing with the risk of\nmilitary escalation in the Middle East after latest developments\nin the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which has driven\noil prices <CLc1> to their lowest since January. \n    The U.S. military is deploying  more forces in the Middle\nEast and Europe following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas\nand Hezbollah to respond to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail\nHaniyeh two days ago in Tehran.\n     \n    \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates    https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\nFX moves 10 days    https://tmsnrt.rs/4dpFKRs\nGraphic-US unemployment rate     https://tmsnrt.rs/3piciFu\nGraphic-US inflation and interest rates    https://reut.rs/4fvmDas\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan; Editing by Christopher\nCushing)\n ((Vidya.ranganathan@tr.com))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

The onshore yuan continues to be a low volatility\ncurrency relative to other Asian FX.\"\n    Song maintained his forecast for the yuan to trade at 7.10\nat the end of this year and 7.00 by the end of 2025.\n    As of 0344 GMT, the onshore yuan <CNY=CFXS> traded at 7.0125\nper dollar, 14 pips weaker than the previous close of 7.0111 on\nFriday.\n    If the yuan finishes the late night close at the midday\nlevel, it would have gained 3.63% in the June-September period\nto book the best quarter since late 2020.\n    Its offshore counterpart <CNH=D3> traded at 6.9942 per\ndollar, compared with the previous close of 6.9806.\n    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China\n(PBOC) set the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan\nis allowed to trade in a 2% band, at 7.0074 per dollar, its\nstrongest since May 2023, and 24 pips firmer than a Reuters'\nestimate <CNY=RTRS> of 7.0098.\n    Some market participants said they squared their books on\nthe last trading day before the week-long Golden Week holiday\nthat starts on Tuesday.\n    China's financial markets will be closed for the long break\nand trading will resume on Oct. 8.\n    China's central bank said late on Sunday it would instruct\nbanks to lower mortgage rates for existing home loans before\nOct. 31, as part of sweeping policies to support the country's\nbeleaguered property market.\n    Also, on the same day Guangzhou city announced the lifting\nof all restrictions on home purchases, while Shanghai and\nShenzhen eased curbs on buying.\n    Yet, some investors said they would stay cautious given huge\nuncertainties around the upcoming U.S. Presidential election and\ngeopolitics.\n    \"In the next 12 to 18 months, as China faces the prospect of\nhigher trade tariffs from every direction, the easiest policy\nadjustment mechanism for the economy is likely to be currency\ndepreciation,\" said Rong Ren Goh, a portfolio manager in the\nfixed income team at Eastspring Investments in Singapore.\n    \n\n (Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

Analysts had expected a 10-15\nbps cut in the five-year LPR, accompanied by a five bps trimming of the one-year\nrate.\n    The asymmetric cut underscores how much emphasis Beijing is placing on\nreviving the property sector, most recently via more credit support for\ndevelopers.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "More expensive gasoline and ecological disasters: the future without CNH and CREThe disappearance of autonomous energy agencies such as the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) and the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) represents a double blow for Mexico: an increase in environmental pollution and a spike in energy prices that would directly affect households and the competitiveness of companies, agreed analysts and organizations.\n\nBased on an analysis derived from the recent approval in the Chamber of Deputies of the reform that eliminates autonomous agencies, the Mexican Confederation of Employers (Coparmex) pointed out that this change endangers the stability and sustainability of the Mexican energy sector .\n\nAs a first point of risk, the document states, it was recalled that the CNH's main mission is to regulate the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons, supervising that these activities are carried out under technical and environmental standards that minimize the negative impact.\n\nWithout this oversight, said the agency, Mexico runs the risk of falling into irresponsible extraction practices by Pemex and other companies in the sector. Of what is currently happening in the hydrocarbons sector in terms of pollution, Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) stands out.\n\nAccording to the report for the second quarter of 2024, the oil company reported a 21.6% increase in sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions compared to the same period of the previous year.\n\nDue to current energy policies , SOx emissions increased from 522,300 tons (Mt) between January and June 2023 to 635,200 Mt in the same period of 2024.\n\nSpills, Coparmex's warning\n\nThese practices, warns Coparmex, could result in oil spills and uncontrolled emissions of polluting gases, aggravating air quality problems and destroying entire ecosystems.\n\nMoody's Analytics' latest report, entitled The Challenges of Energy Transition in Latin America, reinforces this warning. According to the study, Mexico is one of the countries in the region with the least ambitious greenhouse gas emissions targets , allowing for a slight increase in the coming years.\n\nMoreover, its strongest commitments are conditional on obtaining international financing and technological support.\n\nWithout the CNH, the consequences could be disastrous for the environment. Oil spills, uncontrolled emissions and a decades-long setback in sustainability would be inevitable,\n\nsays Coparmex.\n\nThe dismantling of the CNH would not only affect the environment; it would also generate fuel shortages due to inefficient management of energy resources. At the same time, it would cause significant increases in gasoline prices, directly affecting consumers, said Coparmex and the president of the consultancy Edge Innovation, Víctor Hugo Juárez.\n\nCurrently, the CNH guarantees transparency and efficiency in the management of contracts for exploration and production, promoting healthy competition among companies.\n\n\"Without this body, Mexico's ability to attract investment in the energy sector could also be compromised, further limiting access to key fuels and resources,\" said the analyst.\n\nThe CRE: safeguarding competition and energy supply.\n\nFor its part, the CRE oversees the energy market to prevent the formation of monopolies and ensure a stable supply of electricity, gas and fuels. This agency is essential to guarantee competitive prices and a steady flow of energy.\n\nWithout the CRE, Coparmex warns that the country could face a drastic increase in electricity, gas and fuel prices due to the lack of controls. The dominance of a single player, such as Pemex or CFE, could lead to monopolistic practices that would leave consumers and businesses without options.\n\nIn addition, the reliability of energy supply would be at stake. For industries and businesses that depend on a constant flow of electricity and gas, any interruption could translate into millions of dollars in losses.\n\nThe demise of the CRE would also hinder the move toward clean energy sources. Without an agency to drive the development of renewable energy and oversee compliance with standards, Mexico risks failing to meet its international climate change commitments, such as the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nAccording to the Moody's Analytics report, while countries such as Chile and Colombia are leading the energy transition with solid legal frameworks and ambitious goals, Mexico lags behind, relying more than 80% of its energy consumption on sources such as oil and natural gas ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

This marks a significant decrease from its 52-week high of 49.22 CNY recorded on November 20th, 2023, but still represents a modest growth compared to its 52-week low of 20.15 CNY on September 17th, 2024. These fluctuations suggest a mixed bag of performance for the company, with both bullish and bearish sentiments influencing the market. Technical Indicators When examining the technical indicators of QIANXIN, we find that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 48.17, indicating a neutral position. This suggests that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, which could be an attractive entry point for potential buyers. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a negative crossover, implying a possible downtrend. However, this signal might be less reliable given the limited time frame of our analysis. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio One notable aspect of QIANXIN's financial health is its exceptionally high Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 202.32. This indicates that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of the company's earnings, suggesting strong confidence in its future prospects. On the other hand, the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 2.53334 suggests that the stock is slightly undervalued based on its book value. Conclusion While there have been no recent news updates on Qi An Xin Technology Group Inc, a closer look at its historical stock data reveals a mix of positive and negative signals. The stock's moderate growth and relatively high P/E Ratio indicate investor optimism, while the downward trend and neutral RSI suggest caution. As such, investors should exercise prudence when making decisions regarding QIANXIN, carefully considering both the company's fundamentals and the broader market conditions.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Verisilicon Microelectronics Shanghai (688521.SS) traded up 0.86 % and now trades at CNY 52.1.
