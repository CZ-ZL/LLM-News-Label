On Friday, it looked set for its\nfifth straight weekly gain, the longest winning streak in more\nthan three years.\n    While none of the underlying drivers at home, namely a weak\neconomy and capital flight, has changed, the yuan has been\nhelped by growing bets for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts,\nwhich are weakening the dollar, and by a rally in the Japanese\nyen.\n    Meanwhile, Chinese authorities have worked behind the scenes\nto ensure the currency doesn't spike abruptly, which could roil\nfragile domestic financial markets and hurt exporters. They have\nsurveyed the market to gauge the pressure, and quietly relaxed\nrestrictions on imports of gold and trading positions in the\nyuan for some banks.\n    \"The government is probably less concerned about\ndepreciation but remains wary of FX volatility,\" said Gary Ng,\nsenior economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis.\n    \"While the pressure on the yuan may ease as the Fed may\nfinally cut interest rates, there may be sudden and significant\nmovements in capital flows.\"\n        One big reason for the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to\nbe worried is the build-up of speculative short yuan positions\nduring the currency's steady decline since early 2023, which\ncould be unwound messily if the currency rises fast. \n        Foreign companies operating in China, domestic exporters\nand  investors have swapped yuan for dollars to earn better\nreturns in what is known in market circles as the yuan carry\ntrade.  \n        Analysts at the Macquarie Group estimate exporters and\nmultinational companies have accumulated foreign currency\nholdings of more than $500 billion since 2022.\n    \"As the yuan appreciates... concerns about the potential\nunwinding of yuan carry trade and shocks to financial markets\nmay arise,\" said Zhu Chaoping, global market strategist at J.P.\nMorgan Asset Management.\n    \"Recent market volatility in Japan might have reminded\npolicymakers about these risks.\"\n    China's currency regulator, the State Administration of\nForeign Exchange (SAFE), and the PBOC did not immediately\nrespond to Reuters requests for comment.\n        \n  \n    \n    PREVENT A STAMPEDE\n        Possibly to get an idea of pent-up yuan buying that\ncould come as the currency appreciates, SAFE surveyed banks\nabout their clients' FX conversion ratio - the proportion of\nrevenues exporters convert into yuan - last week, two people\nwith direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n    \"FX settlement is the issue that everyone in the market is\nmostly concerned about, besides the Fed rate cut,\" said Liu\nYang, general manager of the financial market business\ndepartment at minerals exporter Zheshang Development Group.\n    \"After all, exports are the only major driver of China's\neconomy among its traditional 'troika' (traditional growth\nengines), and regulators do not want the yuan to appreciate\nrapidly and substantially to weaken the competitiveness of\nexport products,\" he said.\n        Separately, guidance given to banks last year banning\nthem from keeping short yuan positions at the end of a day's\ntrading has also been relaxed for some banks, two people with\ndirect knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n    Chinese banks have also been given new gold import quotas by\nthe central bank, Reuters reported. Gold imports are usually\ncurtailed when the yuan faces depreciation pressures.\n    The measures are subtle, analysts said, and together with\nthe trend in the PBOC's daily benchmark guidance setting for the\nyuan, simply point to a desire to contain volatility, rather\nthan thwart gains.\n    Still, market participants are revising their yuan\nforecasts. \n    Analysts at BofA Securities expect the yuan will continue to\nweaken, \"given subdued growth and PBOC's easing bias\", but see\nthe yuan at 7.38 per dollar by year-end, not 7.45 as they had\npreviously forecast. It is currently around 7.14 per dollar.    \n\n        \n  \n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nChina's dollar hoard vs yuan    https://tmsnrt.rs/4cC2ixy\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom\nEditing by Vidya Ranganathan and Kim Coghill)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Offshore Yuan Climbs to Over a 1-Year HighThe offshore yuan strengthened past 7.08 per dollar, extending its gains for a second consecutive session and reaching its highest level since June 2023, mainly driven by robust corporate demand for the Chinese currency. The surge in dollar selling by Chinese companies could intensify in the short term, potentially triggering a \"stampede\" that further boosts the yuan. The rising expectations of US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts also contributed to the yuan's appreciation. Over the month, the offshore yuan is on track to gain nearly 2%, marking its best performance since December 2023. Meanwhile, traders are now closely watching the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, due later today, and Chinese PMI data set for release on Saturday, for deeper insights into global economic conditions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

Despite the Fed's significant rate cut, Powell tempered expectations by stating that the Fed is not rushing to ease policy and that the half-percentage-point cuts are not the “new pace.\" He also emphasized that ultra-low interest rates are unlikely to return, with the neutral rate expected to be higher than in previous cycles. Meanwhile, China’s central bank took action to ensure liquidity by injecting CN¥568.2 billion ($80.11 billion) through seven-day reverse repos on Wednesday. The bank also confirmed plans to roll over MLF loans on September 25, delaying changes amid a monetary policy overhaul aimed at making short-term rates a more influential guide for market dynamics.

During the seventeenth ordinary session of the CNH's Governing Body, it was detailed that this assignment is located off the coast of Tabasco, within the Cuencas del Sureste oil province.Jennifer Elliott, from the Exploration and Supervision Technical Unit, explained that the reason for the modification is to provide an additional exploration period, as well as the variation in the number of well prospects to be drilled by Pemex.\"Making a comparison with respect to the last approved exploration plan, four prospects were considered; two in the base scenario and two in the incremental scenario, the two prospects of the base scenario were already drilled, and the wells that were considered in the incremental scenario are now part of this modification,\" it was explained.Works in Tabasco:#ConocePemex in #1minuto With the strategy of exploiting the fields near the facilities, Sini has allowed practically tripling its production in less than 2 years.

Consequently, this policy move provided some breathing room for the PBoC to further ease monetary policy without heavily impacting the currency.

Headline: Shanghai Lingang Holdings Corp Ltd: A Steady Performer with Room for Growth? Investors may be looking for steady performers in the current market landscape, and Shanghai Lingang Holdings Corp Ltd (SHL) could fit the bill. With no recent news and a stable share price over the past year, SHL has been flying under the radar despite its potential for growth. A Look at the Numbers As of September 20th, 2024, the last closing price of SHL was 8.88 CNH, representing a 52-week high of 11.71 CNH on February 7th, 2024, and a 52-week low of 8.17 CNH on September 9th, 2024. This suggests that the stock has been trading within a relatively narrow range over the past year, with some fluctuation due to short-term market volatility. Technical Analysis From a technical standpoint, SHL's relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at 48.67, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. Additionally, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator shows a bullish crossover, which could indicate an upward trend in the near future. However, this signal is still in its early stages, and investors should monitor the situation closely before making any decisions. Valuation Metrics SHL's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 26.04, which is slightly above the industry average but still considered reasonable given the company's growth prospects. Its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.17 indicates that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its peers, reflecting investor confidence in the company's long-term outlook. Outlook and Conclusion While there have been no recent developments regarding Shanghai Lingang, the company's track record of steady performance and growth potential make it an attractive option for investors seeking stability and upside potential. As the global economy continues to recover from the pandemic, SHL's focus on economic development and international cooperation could position it well for future success. Therefore, investors may want to keep a close eye on this under-the-radar player in the Chinese market.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Minmetals Capital\n\nThe Minmetals Capital Co Ltd is a financial service company based in Beijing, China.

The central bank's\ndaily benchmark fixings and support from state-owned banks have\nslowed its decline but it hit a November low of 7.2370 in early\ntrades.\n    The currency is down 1.9% this year, pressured by its\nrelative low yields versus other currencies and outflows of\nforeign investment from an anaemic stock market. It is facing\nselling pressure as China eases monetary policy, leading to a\nwidening gap between U.S. and Chinese interest rates.\n    The People's Bank of China set the midpoint rate for the\nyuan <CNY=PBOC> at 7.0968 per U.S. dollar prior to market open,\n1,654 pips firmer than a Reuters estimate <CNY=RTRS>, the\nbiggest discrepancy since Reuters started its estimations in\n2018.

Implied volatility is dynamic for all\ndates, but shorter-date expiry options tend to see the biggest implied\nvolatility changes amid spot volatility and impending event risks.\n    As a case in point, overnight expiry option implied volatility has increased\nsince including Wednesday's U.S. CPI and Thursday's European Central Bank\nannouncement to offer clues about the perceived reaction.  \n    However, it's option risk reversal contracts that show the directional risk\nattached to a given currency pair.

They're always\nconcerned, even well before this for so many years, about hedge\nfunds coming in and taking advantage of the yen,\" said Quincy\nKrosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, in Charlotte,\nNC. \"So they typically come out with the warning to notify the\nmarket that 'we could come in and thwart your ambition in our\ncurrency market'.\"\n    The yen has been sliding despite the Bank of Japan's first\ninterest rate hike for 17 years last week, as traders expect\nvery gradual tightening and possible delays to long-expected\nFederal Reserve easing.\n    BOJ board member Naoki Tamura reinforced the dovish outlook\non further tightening on Wednesday, saying the central bank\nshould \"move slowly but steadily toward policy normalisation\".\n    The stocks rally ramped up late in Wall Street's session.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose  1.22%, to end at\n39,760.08, outpacing the other main indexes because of a strong\nrally in Merck <MRK.N> after the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration approved its therapy for adults suffering from a\nrare lung condition. \n    The S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 0.86%, closing at 5,248.49 and the\nNasdaq Composite <.IXIC> gained 0.51% to 16,399.52. \n    The Nikkei <.N225> closed 0.9% higher.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Outlook for yuan assets stable amid global volatility: analystsAs global markets encountered tremendous volatility in recent days, Chinese markets remained relatively stable, with the yuan strengthening against the US dollar, and the outlook for yuan-denominated assets remains bright, Chinese analysts said on Tuesday.Amid concerns over a potential recession in the US economy, China's economy is expected to rebound steadily despite downward pressure, as more policy measures will likely offer strong support, which in turn will further improve the attractiveness of yuan-denominated assets for global investors, analysts noted. Following a widespread sell-off on Monday, Asian stocks bounced back on Tuesday. Japan's main stock index, the Nikkei, gained more than 10 percent, rebounding sharply from a record loss of 12.4 percent on Monday. In South Korea, the Kospi rose 3.5 percent on Tuesday, following an 8.8 percent drop on Monday.On the Chinese mainland, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.23 percent on Tuesday, while the smaller Shenzhen Component Index gained 0.82 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index was down 0.31 percent on Tuesday.Notably, the yuan saw remarkable gains in recent days. On Monday, the onshore yuan reached a seven-month high of 7.1120 against the US dollar, while the offshore yuan reached a high of 7.0636, according to Reuters. While the yuan eased somewhat on Tuesday, it remained relatively strong, with the central parity rate strengthening 27 pips to 7.1318 against the US dollar, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.Compared with record losses and gains overseas, Chinese markets remained relatively stable and will likely attract more global investors, analysts noted.Cheng Shi, chief economist of ICBC International, said that Chinese stocks have been under pressure amid some capital outflows, but as overseas markets undergo corrections, some global capital will likely return. \"We are cautiously optimistic about A-share stocks and Hong Kong stocks,\" Cheng told the Global Times, noting that recent top policy meetings in China have emphasized achieving the annual growth targets, and various policy measures will offer support for Chinese stocks. \"It is expected that more supportive policies will be rolled out, which will help form a policy-catalyzed market trend.\" Analysts also said that as Chinese policymakers are expected to continue to support the economic recovery, the yuan's exchange rate will remain overall stable, despite fluctuations by other major currencies, and yuan-denominated assets could become safe havens for global capital. \"As recent top meetings stressed the need to stabilize economic growth, more policy measures will offer further support for the yuan's strengthening,\" Yang Delong, chief economist at Shenzhen-based First Seafront Fund, told the Global Times on Tuesday, noting that yuan-denominated assets will likely become more popular among global investors.A meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee on July 30, which focused on economic work for the second half of 2024, stressed the need to determinedly accomplish the economic and social development targets for the year, and pointed out that the implementation of macro policies should continue to be strengthened. Specifically, the meeting noted that the emphasis should be placed on boosting consumption to expand domestic demand.China has set a GDP growth target of about 5 percent for 2024, and many economists said that the country is on track to achieve the target, despite growing external downward pressure. China's steady economic recovery, compared with recessionary worries about the US economy, will also offer strong support for the yuan's exchange rate and the attractiveness of yuan-denominated assets, analysts said. \"On the one hand, as the likelihood of the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates grows, the attractiveness of the dollar will weaken, which in turn will ease the external depreciation pressure on the yuan. \"On the other hand, China's economy achieved a year-on-year growth rate of 5 percent in the first half of 2024, showing that China's economy still maintains stable growth momentum despite global uncertainties, providing support for the yuan's exchange rate,\" Cheng said.\n\nCopyright Global Times.
