{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "May 17 (Reuters) - In a drum-roll to China's potential property market\nrescue involving state-funded purchases of unsold homes, data revealed that real\nestate investment declined further in January-April. Some investor optimism is\nreturning, but consumer scepticism lingers due to the scale of the problem.\n    The nagging issue of low property prices persists as buyers fret over\neconomic uncertainty and the solvency of developers. By buying unsold inventory,\nBeijing would presumably be seeking to put a floor under property values while\nsimultaneously helping keep developers afloat, ensuring projects can be\ncompleted.\n    But sceptics are rightly pointing out the massive overhang of excess supply\nin the property market that will take years to clear. Friday's scheduled\nbriefing by China's central bank and housing regulators may offer details of the\nplan, which could be implemented as soon as June.\n    Declining property values aren't just throttling the construction sector and\nrelated industries, but also affecting consumer attitudes. \n    Data released Friday showed familiar trends with April retail sales again\nfalling short of forecasts while industrial output topped expectations.\nGovernment stimulus for production has proved effective, but efforts to juice\nconsumption via appliance trade-in programmes and tax relief measures are\nlagging.\n    What Beijing must do is to arrest the decline in home prices, and soon,\nbefore confidence takes another hit when U.S.-China trade tensions inevitably\nrise closer to the U.S. presidential elections in November.\n    For more click on [FXBUZ] \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nChina Retail Sales:     https://tmsnrt.rs/3V4IKfV\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Ewen Chew is a Reuters market analyst.

The\nfalling yields in China are contributing to a widening interest\nrate gap between China and the United States, putting further\npressure on the yuan. \n    Prior to the market's opening, the People's Bank of China\nset the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is\nallowed to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1039 per U.S. dollar, 16\npips firmer than the previous fix 7.1055. \n    \n\n (Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam and Christian Schmollinger)\n ((Li.Gu@thomsonreuters.com;))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike\nDolan\nWith Middle East anxiety still brewing in the background, the\nred hot U.S. retail readout for March has underlined the sheer\nstrength of the economic expansion there and is super-charging\nthe dollar around the world.\n    Against Tuesday's news of a spluttering March for China's\neconomy, and a surprising rise in British jobless during the\nmonth, the exceptional U.S. performance stands out yet again and\nhas catapulted the dollar to new highs for the year.\n    China's first-quarter GDP annual growth of 5.3% did surpass\nexpectations but March industry and retail growth missed\nforecasts, new home prices fell at their fastest pace in eight\nyears and property investment fell almost 17% year-on-year.  \n    And even though Wall St stocks indexes <.SPX> were\nside-swiped again on Monday by a mix of the interest rate\nimplications of such brisk growth, heightened geopolitical\ntensions and a tepid earnings season outlook, the greenback is\nbuilding a head of steam.\n    Aided by scaled-back Federal Reserve rate cut expectations\nwhile pressure builds on other central banks to ease first, the\ndollar's main index <.DXY> hit a five-month high on Tuesday and\nhas now gained 4% in just six weeks.\n    The euro <EUR>, China's offshore yuan <CNH=> and sterling\n<GBP=> hit their weakest levels against the buck since November\nwhile the Japan's yen <JPY=> skidded to new 34-year low of\n154.60 per dollar. Currency volatility gauges <.DBCVIX> hit\ntheir highest in more than two months. \n    Monday's news of a surprise March U.S. retail sales surge\nsaw economists revise up their first-quarter U.S. economic\ngrowth estimates to just under 3% annualised. Morgan Stanley\nraised its Q1 gross domestic product growth estimate to 2.7% \nfrom 2.4% and against a standing consensus forecast of 2.1%. The\nAtlanta Fed's 'GDPNow' real time estimate is running at 2.8%.\n    The figures reinforced the 'no landing' economic scenario\ntouted by many investors and drew caution from Fed officials and\njarring interest rate markets yet again.\n    \"The worst thing to do is act urgently when urgency is not\nrequired,\" said San Francisco Fed boss Mary Daly, one of 19 U.S.\ncentral bankers who set monetary policy.\n    Fed futures now don't see a first rate cut this year until\nSeptember.\n    With the International Monetary Fund's Spring meeting\ngetting underway in Washington this week, Fed Chair Jerome\nPowell is due to speak on Tuesday - as is European Central Bank\nhead Christine Lagarde and Bank of England governor Andrew\nBailey.\n    The IMF also releases its updated World Economic Outlook\nlater on Tuesday and markets will keenly watch its forecasts for\nU.S. growth for this year and next.\n    In the meantime, March U.S. industrial production and\nhousing starts are the next big numbers in the data diary.\n    The upshot is a restive U.S. Treasury market, where 10-year\nTreasury yields hit 4.66% on Monday for the first time since\nNovember and held those gains today. Treasury volatility gauges\n<.MOVE> hit their highest since Jan. 5.\n    With the first quarter U.S. corporate earnings season\nkicking into gear, stock market volatility is on the rise again\ntoo. The VIX <.VIX> 'fear index' hit its highest of the year on\nTuesday too at 19.56 - coincidentally the average of the past 35\nyears since the index's inception.\n    Although a Goldman Sachs beat on Monday lifted its stock and\ncontrasted to a shaky start to the season for the big banks, the\naggregate annual profit growth estimate for S&P500 companies has\nfallen to 2.7% for Q1 from as much as 5% at the start of the\nmonth and more than 7% at the start of the year. \n    Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are among the big names\nreporting later on Tuesday.\n    The mix of rate worries, earnings and geopolitics saw the\nS&P500 lose more than 1% again on Monday to its lowest in almost\ntwo months, although futures were steadier ahead of today's\nbell. The Russell 2000 of small cap stocks <.RUT> fell 1.4% and\nis now negative for the year to date.\n    Bourses across Asia and Europe were down more than 1% on\nTuesday too. \n    With Middle East tensions simmering, U.S. crude oil prices\n<CLc1> held steady about $85 per barrel.

The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 14.35 on 09/03/2024. 52 weeks low was at CNY 8.31 on 11/08/2023.\n\nSummary of the latest news for China Coal Energy\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: China Coal Energy's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain exposure to the Chinese energy sector may want to take a closer look at China Coal Energy Co Ltd (OTCMKTS: CCOZY), which has been experiencing a mix of positive and negative signals in recent months. Despite posting strong earnings results, the stock has struggled to maintain momentum, leaving analysts divided on its future prospects. Earnings Performance According to the latest report from American Banking News, China Coal Energy posted impressive earnings results on August 28th, with a profit of $0.16 per share, beating expectations by $0.03. This marks the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for the company, indicating a steady increase in demand for its coal products. Price Action However, despite these promising earnings, the stock has failed to sustain any significant gains. As of September 22nd, the last closing price was $12.93, down from its 52-week high of $14.35 on September 2nd. This drop can be attributed to investor hesitation due to the uncertain global economic environment and fluctuating commodity prices. Technical Indicators From a technical standpoint, China Coal Energy's performance appears to be mixed. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 52.67, suggesting that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator indicates a bearish crossover, hinting at a potential downward trend. Key Resistance and Support Levels Key resistance levels for China Coal Energy include $14.35 (52-week high), $13.50 (200-day moving average), and $12.50 (support level). Key support levels include $11.50 (200-day moving average), $10.50 (support level), and $9.50 (2019 low). Conclusion While China Coal Energy's earnings results suggest a healthy business, the stock's inability to maintain upward momentum raises concerns among investors. From a technical perspective, the MACD indicator suggests a potential downward trend, while the RSI remains neutral. Therefore, investors may want to approach this stock with caution, waiting for clearer signs of direction before making any investment decisions.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Cmoc (603993.SS) traded up 3.92 % and now trades at CNY 6.83.

As of the last closing price of 7.44 HKD, Cmoc has seen significant growth over the past year, with its 52-week high reaching 9.87 HKD on April 21st, 2024. This represents a substantial increase of 27.6% from its previous 52-week high. Additionally, the stock has experienced a low of 4.12 HKD on February 14th, 2024, representing a gain of 83.7% since then.

However, the stock's price to earnings ratio (P/E) of 17.27 and price to book ratio (P/B) of 3.43 suggest that it may be slightly overvalued based on its earnings and book value. Despite this, analysts remain optimistic about the company's future prospects. In their latest report, they noted that Fuyao Glass Industry has been expanding its product offerings and increasing its market share in the domestic Chinese market. Additionally, the company's strong financial position, with a low debt-to-equity ratio and ample cash reserves, bodes well for its long-term growth potential. Given these factors, investors may want to keep an eye on Fuyao Glass Industry as a potentially attractive investment opportunity. However, it is important to continue monitoring the company's performance and industry trends before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Crrc (1766.HK) traded up 3.49 % and now trades at HKD 4.86.

After reaching a 52-week high of $8.13 on August 21st, 2024, the stock saw a significant correction, falling to a low of $5.03 on December 20th, 2023. However, the stock has since recovered some ground, closing at $6.72 on September 10th, 2024.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently sitting at 48.17, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is showing a bullish crossover, suggesting that the upward trend may continue. In terms of valuation, CRRC's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 9.53, which is slightly above the industry average.

This marks a significant recovery from the 52-week low of 41.6 CNH seen on September 13th, 2023. A closer look at the company's financial ratios paints an even more promising picture. With a Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 224.26, investors can expect substantial growth potential compared to industry peers. Additionally, the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) stands at 8.76, indicating undervaluation based on the company's net assets. These figures suggest that SERES may be poised for long-term success and potentially offer attractive entry points for savvy investors. While there have been no recent news updates on the company, the successful launch of their new energy vehicle product, SERES 5, in Europe bodes well for future sales and revenue growth. Furthermore, the first batch of user deliveries took place on June 21st, 2023, in Norway, highlighting the company's commitment to expanding its global presence. Given these positive developments and the company's solid financials, it may be worth considering SERES Group Co Ltd as a viable investment opportunity.

Hong Kong's China Everbright Bank Sees Steady Growth Despite Recent Lull in Trading Activity Despite a lack of recent news, Hong Kong's China Everbright Bank has maintained steady growth in the past year, with its shares trading at around 2.33 Hong Kong dollars (HKD) as of September 2nd, according to Finanzen.net. This represents a modest increase from the 52-week low of 2.13 HKD recorded on January 21st, but a slight decrease from the 52-week high of 2.64 HKD reached on May 19th. Technical Analysis Indicates Mixed Signals From a technical standpoint, the stock's price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) stands at 3.39, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately three times the company's earnings per share for each dollar of net income. Meanwhile, the price to book ratio (P/B Ratio) is 0.29892, suggesting that the market values the company's assets at roughly 30% above their book value. These ratios suggest mixed signals about the company's future performance. On one hand, the P/E Ratio indicates that investors have high expectations for the company's earnings growth, while the P/B Ratio suggests that the market may be overvaluing the company's assets. However, without more recent news or developments, it is difficult to accurately assess the company's prospects. In conclusion, while there have been no significant updates on China Everbright Bank in recent days, the company's steady growth and stable financial fundamentals suggest that it remains a solid long-term investment opportunity. Nevertheless, investors should continue to monitor the company's progress and any changes in the broader economic landscape before making any investment decisions.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout China Coal Energy\n\nChina Coal Energy Co Ltd. is a mining and processing company that specializes in producing thermal and coking coal products.

The odds of that happening rose after\nthe recent debate between Trump and President Joe Biden. \n    The yuan will \"have to contend\" with the likelihood of\nincreased U.S. and China tensions and will remain under\npressure, said Lloyd Chan, senior currency analyst at MUFG Bank.\n    China's central bank is likely to allow measured weakness in\nthe currency heading into the U.S. elections, which may drive\nthe offshore yuan lower towards 7.35-7.40, said Brad Bechtel,\nhead of foreign exchange at Jefferies.\n    The yuan was last at 7.3062 per dollar and the rupee at\n83.52.\n    The rupee, though, is expected to be well supported by\nportfolio inflows and an upbeat economic outlook in comparison\nto China's, which has sputtered due to the protracted troubles\nin the real estate sector.\n    All in all, the pressure on the yuan is higher than on the\nrupee, Societe Generale said in a note.\n    The common factor is both currencies have low volatility\nrelative to their Asian peers, largely due to active forex\nmanagement by the respective central banks.\n    That, combined with the wide interest rate differential,\nadds to the trade's appeal, Bechtel said.\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nRealised and implied volatility of major Asian currencies    https://reut.rs/4eRjjX5\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Jaspreet Kalra and Nimesh Vora; Editing by Savio\nD'Souza)\n ((jaspreet.kalra@thomsonreuters.com; +91-8769636545;))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

The State Council\nInformation Office, which handles media queries for the\ngovernment, did not also immediately respond to a request for\ncomment. \n    Financial News, the PBOC's publication, subsequently put out\nan article saying the foundation for a \"basically stable\" yuan\nexchange rate remains \"solid,\" and that the yuan is likely to\nstabilise and strengthen towards the end of this year.\n    \n    Allowing the yuan to depreciate next year would deviate from\nthe usual practice of keeping the foreign exchange rate stable,\nthe sources said.\n    The tightly managed yuan is allowed to move 2% on either\nside of a daily mid-point fixed by the central bank. Policy\ncomments from top officials typically include commitments to\nkeeping the yuan stable.\n    While the central bank is unlikely to say it will no longer\nuphold the currency, it will emphasize allowing the markets more\npower in deciding the yuan's value, one source with knowledge of\nthe matter said. \n    At a meeting this week of the Politburo, a decision-making\nbody of Communist Party officials, China pledged to adopt an\n\"appropriately loose\" monetary policy next year, marking the\nfirst such easing of its policy stance in some 14 years.\n    The comments did not include a reference to the need for a\n\"basically stable yuan\", which was last mentioned in July but\nmissing in the September readout, too.\n    Yuan policy has figured heavily in financial analysts' notes\nand other think-tank discussions this year. \n    In a paper published by leading thinktank China Finance 40\nForum last week, analysts suggested China should temporarily\nswitch from anchoring the yuan to the U.S dollar to linking it\ninstead to a basket of non-dollar currencies, particularly the\neuro, to ensure the exchange rate is flexible during a period of\ntrade tensions. \n    A second source privy to the central bank's thinking told\nReuters the PBOC has considered the possibility the yuan could\ndrop to 7.5-per-dollar to counteract any trade shocks. \n    That's a roughly 3.5% depreciation from current levels\naround 7.25.\n    During Trump's first term as president, the yuan weakened\nmore than 12% against the dollar during a series of tit-for-tat\ntariff announcements between March 2018 and May 2020.\n    \n    DIFFICULT CHOICE\n    A weaker yuan could help the world’s second-biggest economy\nas it seeks to reach what is expected to be a challenging 5%\neconomic growth target and relieve deflationary pressures by\nboosting export earnings and making imported goods more\nexpensive.\n    A sharp downturn in exports would give further cause for\nauthorities to try and use the currency to protect the one\nsector of the economy that has been doing well.\n    China's exports slowed sharply and imports unexpectedly\nshrank in November, spurring calls for more policy support to\nprop up domestic demand.\n    \"To be fair, it is a policy option. Currency adjustments are\non the table as a tool to be used to mitigate the effects of\ntariffs,\" said HSBC's chief Asia economist Fred Neumann.\n    But that would be a short-sighted policy choice, he said.\n    \"If China takes the currency aggressively lower, it raises\nthe risk of a tariff cascade and other nations then essentially\nsay, well, if the Chinese currency is weakening dramatically,\nthen we may not have a choice to impose import restrictions on\ngoods from China ourselves,\" Neumann said.\n    \"So there is a bit of a risk here that if China uses its\ncurrency angle too aggressively, it could lead to a backlash\namong other trading partners and that's not in the interest of\nChina.\"              \n     Analysts' average forecast is for the yuan to fall to 7.37\nper dollar by the end of next year, though a key factor will be\nhow much Trump raises tariffs and how quickly.\n    The currency has lost nearly 4% of its value against the\ndollar since the end of September as investors positioned for a\nTrump presidency. \n    The central bank has in the past contained volatility and\ndisorderly moves in the yuan through its daily guidance rate to\nmarkets and through state banks’ buying and selling of the\ncurrency.    \n     The yuan, or renminbi (RMB) as it is sometimes known, has\nstruggled since 2022, weighed down by an anaemic economy and a\ndrop in foreign capital inflows into China's markets. Higher\nU.S. rates and falling Chinese ones have also kept it under\npressure.\n    The offshore yuan fell around 0.3% to 7.2854 per dollar\nafter the Reuters story. The Korean won <KRW=> also dipped as\ndid the China-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars. \n    In the coming days, next year's growth, budget deficit and\nother targets will be discussed - but not announced - at an\nannual meeting of Communist Party leaders, known as the Central\nEconomic Work Conference (CEWC). \n    A pledge to \"maintain the basic stability of the RMB\nexchange rate at a reasonable and balanced level\" was included\nin the CEWC summaries from 2020, 2022 and 2023.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "USD/CNH Forecast: Chinese Yuan Continues to Suffer at the Hands of the US Dollar - 01 July 2024However, it's obvious that Asian currencies in general are on the back foot, and the Chinese Yuan will be any different. After all, the Chinese Yuan isn't necessarily the easiest to convert into the open markets, although it's probably worth noting that it is not a free-flowing currency either.\n\n[geotargetedbrokercarousel]\n\n * The US dollar initially pulled back against the Chinese Yuan, only to turn around and show signs of strength again.\n * As we continue to threaten the 7.3 level, this is an area that I think a lot of people will be paying close attention to in the fact that we have rocked back and forth does suggest that perhaps it is going to be a barrier that's a bit difficult to overtake.\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nThe pair has been rallying for some time and I don't think that changes anytime soon. If we do pull back from here, it makes a certain amount of sense that we would see the 50-Day EMA offer support, but that is all the way down at the 7.25 level. Between here and there, I would anticipate a bit of a bounce, and I think that bounce comes into the picture to offer plenty of value for traders willing to get involved. If we can break above the 7.33 level, then I think the market goes looking to the 7.35 level. The market will continue to be noisy, but all things being equal this has a feel of a \"buy on the dips\" type of market.\n\nIn general, I remain bullish of this market, but I also recognize that it does tend to be very choppy, and the People's Bank of China is heavily influential as it will have a \"reference rate\" that the currency is allowed to float. Because of this, I think you have to be cautious, but right now it certainly looks like traders are willing to jump in and buy greenbacks, so I think any pullback at this juncture is going to end up being a nice buying opportunity.\n\nNot sure which broker to choose?

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Forex: China Stimulus - Another False Dawn Or The Real Deal?Dec 10, 2024\n\nImage source: Pixabay  \n\nWhile I typically harbor skepticism toward China's grand stimulus declarations, the price action in FX markets speaks volumes. The uplift in Asian FX might seem promising, especially the CNH, but I see these shifts as optimal moments to hedge against Trump's looming tariff threats. All this stimulus chatter should get under President-elect Trump's skin, who could interpret this as an even bigger opportunity to intensify trade pressures to mitigate China’s substantial trade surplus.\n\nAs we edge closer to China's highly anticipated Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC), market spectators are on high alert for any new details regarding the scale of policy stimulus planned for the upcoming year. Recent buzz suggests that the Chinese government may aim for a more expansive budget deficit of 3.0% to 4.0% of GDP next year, an uptick from this year's 3.0%.\n\nInvestors are particularly keen to see if the stimulus will extend beyond typical infrastructure spending to include fiscal measures that bolster personal consumption, helping to rebalance demand within China's economy. Such a move would be warmly received, as it could address the chronic deflation issue.\n\nHowever, with bond yields in China already touching record lows, there's growing skepticism about the effectiveness of further monetary easing to spur growth. This upcoming conference could shed crucial light on China's economic strategy, significantly influencing global market sentiments.\n\nI anticipate the dollar will maintain its resilience and rally after the December Fed cut, especially given the backdrop of looming tariffs, which could nudge U.S. yields higher. However, the surprising endurance of the recent bond rally has unexpectedly tempered the dollar’s ascent more than I had foreseen, adding an unusual twist to the usual interplay of trade war dynamics and currency valuations.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is in the “blackout “period before the critical rate decision scheduled for December 18th, putting the spotlight squarely on this week’s U.S. CPI data. Market consensus is leaning towards another stubbornly high 0.3% increase in core CPI month-on-month. Although this isn’t ideal, it's unlikely to sway the Fed from proceeding with a planned 25 basis point cut in December. However, a spike to 0.4% in the core CPI could dramatically shift perspectives, challenging the wisdom of rate reductions amidst escalating inflationary pressures, particularly with the impending tariff adjustments under the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThe yen's lack of momentum following the U.S. non-farm payroll data—which seemed weaker beneath the surface—was a significant red flag, as noted in our weekend report. Similarly, yesterday's tepid response to robust Japanese economic reports suggests caution is warranted, especially if US yields kick up. It seems the FX market is voting with the buy USDJPY button that the Bank of Japan is on hold this month.\n\nAs for the euro, all eyes are now on the aftermath of the ECB’s rate decision. Lagarde's upcoming press conference could hint at further easing, potentially setting a dovish stage for the EUR.\n\nYesterday's commodity rally, spurred by chatter around China's stimulus plans, initially sent commodity currencies like the Australian dollar and the South African rand soaring. However, the Australian dollar has since retraced most of its gains, diving sharply in Asia following the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) latest policy meeting. This downturn saw the AUD/USD fall below the 0.6400 level after briefly reaching a high of 0.6471 yesterday.\n\nThe RBA opted to maintain its policy rate at 4.35%, a stance unchanged throughout the year, but the nuances in its updated policy statement captured market attention. The statement suggested that the Board is \"gaining some confidence that inflationary pressures are declining,\" aligning with their latest forecasts from the November Statement on Monetary Policy.

And there were\npromises of more monetary easing to come in China to add to the\nmix.\n    Although the Bank of Japan finally set about 'normalising'\nin the other direction, and Taiwan's central bank delivered a\nsurprise hike too, the overall thrust is a global central bank\ncycle that has turned before the Federal Reserve kicks off.\n    While the Fed held the line on Wednesday, as expected, and\ncontinued to flag three rate cuts later this year, the slightly\nhawkish takeaway was that its policymaker projections removed\none cut from next year's 'dot plot'.\n    And so with other central banks jumping the Fed gun on the\nfirst move and potentially cutting deeper over the coming two\nyears, the dollar <.DXY> has got a shot in the arm.\n    The dollar index hit its highest in over a month on Friday\nand has now climbed more than 2% from March troughs.\n    Eye-catching overnight was a swoon in China's offshore yuan\n<CNH=> to its weakest level of the year, without any ostensible\ntrigger beyond the dovish soundings from deputy governor of the\nPeople's Bank of China.

Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion has a market capitalisation of CNY 6.1 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is 18.89. Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Shaanxi Heimao Coking (601015.SS) traded up 0.69 % and now trades at CNY 3.03.

Cwb Automotive Electronics has a market capitalisation of CNY 6 bn. Cwb Automotive Electronics has a current price to earnings ratio of 23.27. Title: CWB Automotive Electronics: Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain a foothold in the booming automotive electronics market may want to take a closer look at CWB Automotive Electronics Co Ltd (CWEB), a Chinese firm that has been making waves with its innovative technology solutions. Despite a lack of recent news, a technical analysis of the company's performance paints a mixed picture of its potential. Current Price and Past Performance As of September 24th, 2024, CWEB's last closed price stood at 14.9 CNY, down from its 52-week high of 24.59 CNY recorded on November 28th, 2023. However, this decline has not deterred investors, as the stock has still seen significant growth over the past year, with a 52-week range of 11.3 CNY to 24.59 CNY. This volatility suggests that the company's future performance could be influenced by various factors, including changes in consumer demand and technological advancements. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio One key metric that investors often consider when evaluating CWEB's performance is its price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio). Currently standing at 23.27, this figure indicates that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its peers, suggesting that investors have high expectations for the company's future earnings growth. Additionally, CWEB's price to book ratio (P/B ratio) of 3.28221 implies that the stock is undervalued based on its assets, which could be an attractive opportunity for value investors. Technical Indicators When examining CWEB's chart patterns, several technical indicators provide insights into the company's short-term and long-term prospects. For instance, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 61.8%, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal remains bullish, with a positive crossover hinting at continued upward momentum. However, the Stochastic Oscillator reveals that the stock is approaching overbought territory, which could lead to a correction or consolidation period in the near future. Conclusion While CWEB's recent lack of news may raise concerns among investors, a technical analysis of the company's performance highlights both positive and negative signals. With a premium P/E ratio and undervalued P/B ratio, the stock appears to be attractively priced for those willing to take on some risk. However, the stock's volatility and approach to overbought territory suggest caution may be warranted before jumping into the fray. As such, investors should carefully weigh these factors before making any decisions regarding their investment strategy.\n\n- Zhongnongfa Seed Industry (600313.SS) traded up 0.55 % and now trades at CNY 5.64.

The\nsmall cap Russell 2000 <.RUT> clocked it best close in almost\nthree years and Dow Jones blue chips <.DJI> set another record\nclose after the index secured a foothold above the 43,000 mark. \n    Streaming giant Netflix <NFLX.O> tops the diary later, with\ninvestors looking for signs its nascent ad revenue business is\naccelerating.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "AUD/USD Stabilizes Amid Chinese Economic Data And US Inflation ConcernsBy RoboForex Analytical Department\n\nThe Australian dollar has momentarily halted its downward trajectory against the US dollar, stabilizing around the 0.6565 mark. With a lack of significant domestic data from Australia, the AUD's movements are largely influenced by the performance of the Chinese yuan and economic developments from China. Recently, the offshore yuan weakened to its lowest in a week at 7.2 against the US dollar, following a series of macroeconomic updates from China.\n\nChina's industrial output showed an impressive year-on-year increase of 7.0%, exceeding both the anticipated 6.5% growth and the previous rate of 4.6%. Capital investment also outperformed expectations, registering a 4.2% year-on-year rise compared to the forecasted 3.2%. Retail sales growth in February was reported at 5.5% year-on-year, albeit a slowdown from January's 7.4% increase. Additionally, the January employment report indicated a slight uptick in unemployment, rising to 5.3% from the prior 5.1%.\n\nDespite these positive indicators from China, the yuan's valuation remains pressured by robust US inflation data, which complicates the Federal Reserve's pathway to easing monetary policy. The prevailing market expectation now leans towards a potential 25 basis point rate cut by the Fed in June, with around a 60% probability of this outcome, a shift from earlier predictions of a spring rate cut.\n\nGiven Australia's close economic and trade ties with China, these statistics from China are particularly significant for the AUD's performance.\n\nTechnical Analysis Of AUD/USD\n\nThe H4 chart analysis of AUD/USD indicates a consolidation phase around the 0.6570 level, with expectations of a downward breakout leading to the continuation of the decline towards the local target of 0.6506. After reaching this target, a potential corrective movement to 0.6570 (testing from below), followed by a further drop to 0.6477, is anticipated. The MACD indicator, with its signal line pointing downwards, supports this bearish scenario.\n\nOn the H1 chart, the AUD/USD pair has concluded its declining wave structure at 0.6570, with a consolidation phase currently observed around this mark. A downward breakout from this consolidation is expected today, aiming for the 0.6506 level. Upon achieving this target, the onset of a corrective phase to 0.6570 (testing from below) may be considered. The Stochastic oscillator, currently above 80 and poised to descend to 20, corroborates the likelihood of this continuation in the bearish trend.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nAny forecasts contained herein are based on the author's particular opinion.

Headline: Technical Analysis: KPC Pharmaceuticals Inc (KPC) Shows Promising Growth Potential Investors may be keeping a close eye on KPC Pharmaceuticals Inc (KPC), as the stock has been exhibiting strong growth potential despite the lack of recent news. According to sources, the last known news regarding KPC dates back to January 23rd, 2024, with a headline that reads \"昆药集团：KPC-149口服溶液临床试验申请获受理\" (KPC-149 Oral Solution Clinical Trial Application Approved). However, this news has had little impact on the stock's performance, suggesting that investor sentiment remains positive. Looking at the charts, KPC has been trending upwards over the past year, with a 52-week high of 24.11 CNH on May 5th, 2024, and a 52-week low of 11.92 CNH on September 17th, 2024. This indicates that the stock has experienced significant growth over the past year, with a gain of approximately 21% between its highest and lowest points. Additionally, the stock's current price of 15.75 CNH represents a discount of around 30% compared to its 52-week high. From a technical standpoint, KPC appears to be trading within a well-established uptrend, with support levels at 11.92 CNH and resistance levels at 24.11 CNH. This suggests that the stock may continue to experience upward momentum in the near future, particularly if it can break through its resistance level and reach new heights. Furthermore, the stock's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 26.59 and price-to-book ratio (P/B) of 2.16 indicate that it may be undervalued relative to its peers, providing an attractive entry point for investors looking to capitalize on its growth potential. Overall, while there may be limited news surrounding KPC at present, the stock's strong historical performance and promising technical outlook suggest that it could be a compelling addition to any portfolio. As such, investors may wish to keep a close eye on KPC and consider initiating or adding to positions as opportunities arise.\n\n- Weaver Network (603039.SS) traded up 3.93 % and now trades at CNY 47.98.

As is the backdrop.\n    China's industrial profits swung back to a sharp contraction\nin August, plunging almost 18% from a year earlier, according to\nnew data.\n    But heading into a series of holidays next week, China's\nmainland stocks indexes <.CSI300 surged anew - adding another\n4.5% again on Friday to notch their best week since 2008.\n    With new public borrowing central to the plan and hopes of\nsome recovery afoot, 10-year Chinese government bond yields\npushed higher. But the offshore yuan <CNH=> backed off 16-month\nhighs amid reported selling by state banks.\n    Back on Wall Street, the persistent strength of the U.S.\neconomy was underlined on Thursday by another surprising drop in\nweekly jobless claims, robust durable goods orders last month\nand second-quarter post-tax corporate profit growth that was\nrevised higher to 3.5%.\n    Attention now turns back to inflation to see if the Federal\nReserve's projected easing path is warranted in that light, and\nAugust PCE gauge is released later on Friday.\n    While consensus forecasts are for a 0.2% rise in 'core' PCE\nlast month that would see the annual rate tick up to 2.7% from\n2.6%, Fed governor Christopher Waller suggested last week\nsoftening components in that report were a key reason for the\nFed's outsize 50-bp rate cut.\n    Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook on Thursday endorsed the\nsize of that cut as a way to address increased \"downside risks\"\nto employment. \"I whole heartedly supported the decision.\"\n    Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the economy was on\ncourse for a 'soft landing' and that would allow Fed rates to\ncome down to 'neutral' levels - seen by Fed officials and\nfinancial markets as around 3% compared to the current 4.75-5.0%\nrange.\n    Given the strength of the latest numbers however, futures\nnow see only a 50% chance of another 50-bp cut at the Fed's next\nmeeting in November.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "More expensive gasoline and ecological disasters: the future without CNH and CREThe disappearance of autonomous energy agencies such as the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) and the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) represents a double blow for Mexico: an increase in environmental pollution and a spike in energy prices that would directly affect households and the competitiveness of companies, agreed analysts and organizations.\n\nBased on an analysis derived from the recent approval in the Chamber of Deputies of the reform that eliminates autonomous agencies, the Mexican Confederation of Employers (Coparmex) pointed out that this change endangers the stability and sustainability of the Mexican energy sector .\n\nAs a first point of risk, the document states, it was recalled that the CNH's main mission is to regulate the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons, supervising that these activities are carried out under technical and environmental standards that minimize the negative impact.\n\nWithout this oversight, said the agency, Mexico runs the risk of falling into irresponsible extraction practices by Pemex and other companies in the sector. Of what is currently happening in the hydrocarbons sector in terms of pollution, Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) stands out.\n\nAccording to the report for the second quarter of 2024, the oil company reported a 21.6% increase in sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions compared to the same period of the previous year.\n\nDue to current energy policies , SOx emissions increased from 522,300 tons (Mt) between January and June 2023 to 635,200 Mt in the same period of 2024.\n\nSpills, Coparmex's warning\n\nThese practices, warns Coparmex, could result in oil spills and uncontrolled emissions of polluting gases, aggravating air quality problems and destroying entire ecosystems.\n\nMoody's Analytics' latest report, entitled The Challenges of Energy Transition in Latin America, reinforces this warning. According to the study, Mexico is one of the countries in the region with the least ambitious greenhouse gas emissions targets , allowing for a slight increase in the coming years.\n\nMoreover, its strongest commitments are conditional on obtaining international financing and technological support.\n\nWithout the CNH, the consequences could be disastrous for the environment. Oil spills, uncontrolled emissions and a decades-long setback in sustainability would be inevitable,\n\nsays Coparmex.\n\nThe dismantling of the CNH would not only affect the environment; it would also generate fuel shortages due to inefficient management of energy resources. At the same time, it would cause significant increases in gasoline prices, directly affecting consumers, said Coparmex and the president of the consultancy Edge Innovation, Víctor Hugo Juárez.\n\nCurrently, the CNH guarantees transparency and efficiency in the management of contracts for exploration and production, promoting healthy competition among companies.\n\n\"Without this body, Mexico's ability to attract investment in the energy sector could also be compromised, further limiting access to key fuels and resources,\" said the analyst.\n\nThe CRE: safeguarding competition and energy supply.\n\nFor its part, the CRE oversees the energy market to prevent the formation of monopolies and ensure a stable supply of electricity, gas and fuels. This agency is essential to guarantee competitive prices and a steady flow of energy.\n\nWithout the CRE, Coparmex warns that the country could face a drastic increase in electricity, gas and fuel prices due to the lack of controls. The dominance of a single player, such as Pemex or CFE, could lead to monopolistic practices that would leave consumers and businesses without options.\n\nIn addition, the reliability of energy supply would be at stake. For industries and businesses that depend on a constant flow of electricity and gas, any interruption could translate into millions of dollars in losses.\n\nThe demise of the CRE would also hinder the move toward clean energy sources. Without an agency to drive the development of renewable energy and oversee compliance with standards, Mexico risks failing to meet its international climate change commitments, such as the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nAccording to the Moody's Analytics report, while countries such as Chile and Colombia are leading the energy transition with solid legal frameworks and ambitious goals, Mexico lags behind, relying more than 80% of its energy consumption on sources such as oil and natural gas ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

But economists polled by Reuters were leaning\ntowards a 25 bp cut.\n    \"The interesting thing is the half point cut, which was\npretty much unexpected or at least only half and half yesterday,\nhas not really given the dollar extra damage - which is quite\nsurprising,\" said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXStreet\nin New York.\n    The dollar index <=USD>, which measures the greenback\nagainst a basket of six peers, was down 0.38% to 100.64 after\nreversing gains made in early trading. It slid to its lowest in\nmore than a year of 100.21 in the previous session.\n    The euro <EUR=EBS> strengthened 0.4% to $1.1163. Against the\nyen <JPY=EBS>, the dollar was 0.33% higher at 142.73 as markets\nanticipate that the Bank of Japan will leave interest rates\nunchanged on Friday.\n    The dollar weakened 0.08% to 0.847 against the Swiss franc\n<CHF=EBS> and dropped 0.34% to 7.070 versus the offshore Chinese\nyuan <CNH=EBS>.\n    \"What it's really doing I think is giving permission, if you\nwill, for the other central banks around the world, some of whom\nhave started to cut rates already, to go further with their rate\ncuts,\" Trevisani said.\n    Money markets priced in 72 bps of additional rate cuts in\n2024 and 192 bps by September 2025. <FEDWATCH>\n    The U.S. Treasury yield curve, which measures the gap\nbetween yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes <US2US10=RR>\nand seen as an indicator of economic expectations, steepened and\nhit its highest since June 2022. It was last at a positive 13.4\nbasis points, indicating more upcoming rate cuts.\n    Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped\nunexpectedly to 12,000 last week, according to Labor Department\ndata on Thursday, suggesting labor market growth. \n    Fed policymakers on Wednesday projected the benchmark\ninterest rate would fall by another half of a percentage point\nby the end of this year, a full percentage point next year and\nhalf of a percentage point in 2026.\n    \"The initial interpretation of the decision was that it was\ndovish and while it was basically even odds that it was going to\nhappen, overall, on the surface, it's still a dovish move,\" said\nEugene Epstein, head of trading & structured products North\nAmerica at Moneycorp in Boston.\n    \"Everything reversed basically by the end of the day, so you\ncan make the argument as a bit of buy the rumour, sell the fact.\nA lot of dovishness was already priced in.\"\n    The pound hit its highest since March 2022 versus the dollar\nafter the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)\nvoted 8-1 to keep rates on hold.

I think that is clear.\n    \"It's tempting to think that Chinese currency weakness could\nfully offset the tariffs in the U.S. and kind of neutralise the\nimpact on the economy. But I think that would be short-sighted.\n    \"The Chinese leadership is likely also to be mindful about\nthe impact of a weaker Chinese currency on other trading\npartners.\n    \"If China takes the currency aggressively lower, it raises\nthe risk of a tariff cascade ... so I think there is a bit of a\nrisk here that if China uses its currency angle too\naggressively, it could lead to a backlash among other trading\npartners and that's not in the interest of China.\"\n    \n    MATT SIMPSON, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, CITY INDEX, BRISBANE\n    \"China recently said that nobody wins in a race to the\nbottom, but that doesn't mean they're not prepared to play\nalong. Now we just need to see a slightly hotter U.S. inflation\nprint to send USD/CNH above 7.3 to help AUD/USD fall to 63c.\"\n    \n    LYNN SONG, CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR GREATER CHINA, ING, HONG KONG\n    \"This sort of mild depreciation is still well within\nexpectations, given an expected stronger dollar backdrop.\n    \"There’s some voices in markets calling for a quick 10-20%\ndepreciation to help offset tariffs. We don’t expect an\nintentional and sharp depreciation like this...rapid movement\nabandoning the currency stability objective would also unwind\nthe progress made over the last few years on maintaining Chinese\npurchasing power, reducing capital outflow pressure, and\nimproving the RMB’s role as a settlement currency.\"\n    \n    JIN MOTEKI, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, NOMURA SECURITIES, TOKYO\n    \"Even if the Chinese yuan depreciates to some extent because\nof Trump's tariffs, I think the yen is unlikely to move in the\nsame direction.\n    \"I think maybe if the Chinese government allows yuan to\ndepreciate, it will support Chinese exports. So in this sense,\nin terms of the demand supply and balance, the yuan is supported\nby the improvement in the Chinese trade balance.\"\n    \n    KEN CHEUNG, FX STRATEGIST, MIZUHO, HONG KONG\n    \"If currency depreciation served as a tactic to counter the\ntariff shock, the likely escalating trade war could reinforce\nUSD exceptionalism and weigh on regional currencies.\n    \"Yuan depreciation to 7.5 will remain manageable on the\ncapital outflow risk, especially with FX stabilising tools in\nplay to manage depreciation pace and magnitude.\"\n    \n    CHARU CHANANA, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SAXO, SINGAPORE:\n    \"China appears increasingly anxious about the impending\nTrump presidency, as indicated by Monday’s stimulus announcement\nand today’s reports on the yuan depreciation. However, these\nmeasures do little to tackle China's fundamental issues of debt\nand the lack of confidence among consumers and businesses.\n    \"In fact, a weaker yuan exacerbates these problems and poses\nthe risk of China being labelled a currency manipulator by the\nU.S. Treasury.\"\n\n\n (Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore, Summer Zhen in\nHong Kong and Kevin Buckland and Brigid Riley in Tokyo; Compiled\nby Tom Westbrook; Editing by Janane Venkatraman\n)\n ((tom.westbrook@tr.com; +65 6973 8284;))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

The median\nforecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey was a 0.4 per cent gain.\n\nThe inflation rate dropped from 0.7 per cent in February, when it had climbed\nabove zero for the first time in six months during the Chinese New Year\nholiday.\n\nProducer prices fell for an 18th straight month.\n\nThe price slowdown suggests China may not get much help from local shoppers to\nmeet growth targets that increasingly rely on selling its manufactured goods\nabroad. In addition, with US inflation moving in the opposite direction, there\nis a risk of an enduring interest-rate gap between the world's two biggest\neconomies that could add downward pressure on the renminbi.\n\n\"The price data clearly mirrors the weak domestic demand,\" said Mr Raymond\nYeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia & New Zealand\nBanking Group.\n\n\"The recent improvement in momentum is primarily export- driven.\"\n\nBefore China's CPI numbers came out, the central bank signalled continued\nsupport for the currency, after the offshore yuan weakened by the most in\nthree weeks overnight on the US inflation surprise. It set its daily reference\nrate at 7.0968 per US dollar, exceeding forecasts by the most on record.\n\nHigher inflation during the February holiday season, along with a tourism\nrevival, had raised hope that Chinese households might be rediscovering their\nappetite to spend. Absent that, the country's ability to hit its economic\ngrowth target of around 5 per cent in 2024 depends on overseas demand.\n\nBuoyant exports and factory activity data in recent weeks encouraged Goldman\nSachs and Morgan Stanley to raise their growth forecasts this week.\n\nThe slowdown in consumer inflation was due to \"waning consumption demand in\nMarch seasonally after the holiday while market supply was generally\nsufficient\", said NBS analyst Dong Lijuan in a statement accompanying the\nrelease of the figures.\n\nWith the housing market slump showing no signs of a turnaround, subdued demand\nfor building materials like steel is dragging producer prices down. The\noverall index declined 2.8 per cent, extending the longest falling streak\nsince 2016.\n\nFading inflation may still ramp up pressure on China's government to offer\nmore support for the economy. Falling prices squeeze companies' profit\nmargins, discouraging them from investment, and there is a risk consumers\ncould become even more reluctant to spend in anticipation that goods will be\ncheaper in the future.\n\nBut Mr Bruce Pang, chief economist for Greater China at Jones Lang LaSalle,\npointed to a constraint for Chinese central bankers: higher-than-expected US\ninflation could delay easing by the Federal Reserve. That would make it harder\nfor China to trim its own rates -- even though it needs to -- due to concern\nabout further weakening of the yuan, he said.\n\nIn a sign that deflation could continue to haunt the economy in the coming\nmonths, price competition in some industries has intensified lately.\n\nCompanies that produce materials for construction, like zinc smelters, have\nbeen forced to lower their charges because of excess capacity, while electric\ncar producers are offering aggressive discounts to lure customers.\n\nCore inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, slowed to\n0.6 per cent in March from 1.2 per cent in February, according to the NBS.\nBLOOMBERG"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

The franc, a\ntraditional safe haven, was also trading at a seven-month high. \n    High-yielding currencies such as the Indian rupee <INR=IN>\nand Mexican peso <MXN=> tumbled, while currencies that had\nhitherto been used for funding investments, such as the yen and\nChina's yuan <CNH=>, rallied.     \n    Treasury yields have been falling quite sharply since last\nweek, when the Federal Reserve kept the policy rate in its\ncurrent 5.25% to 5.50% range while Chair Jerome Powell opened\nthe possibility of a rate cut in September.\n    But by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate had\njumped, expectations for rate cuts deepened.\n    Japanese stocks collapsed on Monday in their biggest single\nday rout since the 1987 Black Monday sell-offs.\n    The euro was up 0.3% at $1.0944 <EUR=EBS> against a\nbroadly-weaker dollar.\n    Expectations for European Central Bank (ECB) rate cuts have\nalso risen. Traders now see more than 90 basis points of rate\ncut from the ECB this year, versus 50 bps a week ago.  \n    \"This is a position unwind and since the National Assembly\nelection was called in France, no one's been long euros,\" Kit\nJuckes, head of FX Strategy at Societe Generale said, referring\nto the euro's slide in June after a snap election was called in\nFrance. \n    \"The euro will be capped by rate and growth expectations but\nprobably range-bound as a result.\"\n    \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates    https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\nFX moves 10 days    https://tmsnrt.rs/4dpFKRs\nGraphic-US unemployment rate     https://tmsnrt.rs/3piciFu\nGraphic-US inflation and interest rates    https://reut.rs/4fvmDas\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore, Sruthi Shankar\nand Sarupya Ganguly in Bengaluru; Editing by Christopher\nCushing, Ros Russell and Christina Fincher)\n ((Vidya.ranganathan@tr.com))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

One Qi An Xin stock can currently be bought for about CNY 33.9 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Qi An Xin stocks is 673.7 mn. Qi An Xin has a current market capitalization of CNY 21.8 bn and approximately CNY 153 mn worth of Qi An Xin was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours.

The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 47.85 on 11/24/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 20.15 on 09/18/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Qi An Xin\n\nTitle: Qi An Xin Technology Group Inc: Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Qi An Xin Technology Group Inc (QIANXIN) may be left scratching their heads due to the lack of recent news. However, by analyzing the company's historical stock data, we can uncover some interesting trends and patterns that could provide valuable guidance for investment decisions. Current Price and Past Performance As of November 14th, 2024, the last closing price of QIANXIN was 34.16 CNY. This marks a significant decrease from its 52-week high of 49.22 CNY recorded on November 20th, 2023, but still represents a modest growth compared to its 52-week low of 20.15 CNY on September 17th, 2024. These fluctuations suggest a mixed bag of performance for the company, with both bullish and bearish sentiments influencing the market. Technical Indicators When examining the technical indicators of QIANXIN, we find that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 48.17, indicating a neutral position. This suggests that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, which could be an attractive entry point for potential buyers. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a negative crossover, implying a possible downtrend. However, this signal might be less reliable given the limited time frame of our analysis. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio One notable aspect of QIANXIN's financial health is its exceptionally high Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 202.32. This indicates that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of the company's earnings, suggesting strong confidence in its future prospects. On the other hand, the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 2.53334 suggests that the stock is slightly undervalued based on its book value. Conclusion While there have been no recent news updates on Qi An Xin Technology Group Inc, a closer look at its historical stock data reveals a mix of positive and negative signals. The stock's moderate growth and relatively high P/E Ratio indicate investor optimism, while the downward trend and neutral RSI suggest caution. As such, investors should exercise prudence when making decisions regarding QIANXIN, carefully considering both the company's fundamentals and the broader market conditions.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Verisilicon Microelectronics Shanghai (688521.SS) traded up 0.86 % and now trades at CNY 52.1.

Trump's proposed tariff and tax policies are\nseen as inflationary and therefore likely to keep U.S. interest\nrates high and undermine trading partners' currencies.\n    During Trump's first presidency, the yuan weakened about 5%\nagainst the dollar during the initial round of U.S. tariffs on\nChinese goods in 2018, and fell another 1.5% a year later when\ntrade tensions escalated.\n    But the yuan's losses were capped after private and official\nsurveys both showed China's manufacturing activity swung back to\ngrowth in October as an expansion in new orders led to a pickup\nin production growth.\n    Prices of new homes in China also rose at a faster pace in\nOctober, traditionally a peak season for house-hunting, a\nprivate survey showed on Friday.\n    \"The economy has accelerated on policy supports, allowing\npolicymakers to achieve this year's growth target of 'around\n5%,'\" said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie.\n    \"As such, the National People's Congress (NPC) meeting may\nfocus on debt swap rather than new stimulus...The next step of\nthe stimulus will largely be determined by the state of external\ndemand, and the outcome of the U.S. election is a key swing\nfactor.\"\n    China's top legislative body will meet from Nov. 4-8, with\nmarkets widely expecting the meeting to approve more fiscal\nstimulus measures.\n    Sources told Reuters this week that China is considering\napproving next week the issuance of more than 10 trillion yuan\n($1.40 trillion) in extra debt in the next few years to revive\nits fragile economy, a fiscal package that is expected to be\nfurther bolstered if Trump wins the U.S. election.\n    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China\n(PBOC) set the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan\nis allowed to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1135 per dollar, and 13\npips weaker than a Reuters' estimate <CNY=RTRS> of 7.1122.\n    Separately, currency traders said they will monitor U.S. job\ndata due later on Friday for more clues on the health of the\nworld's largest economy, given it could affect Federal Reserve's\nmonetary easing trajectory.\n    \n\n (Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom; Editing by Jamie Freed and Sam\nHolmes)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "For best results when printing this announcement, please click on link below:\nhttps://newsfile.refinitiv.com/getnewsfile/v1/story?guid=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20241114:nNRAugmuqi&default-theme=true\n\n\n[ET Net News Agency, 14 November 2024] The U.S. CPI rose by 2.6% year-on-year\nin\n\nOctober, in line with market expectations and favourable to expectations of\nthe Federal\n\nReserve cutting interest rates. However, Chinese concept stocks continued to\nfall\n\novernight, including Tencent (00700), which had mixed quarterly results. The\nHang Seng\n\nIndex maintained trading during the first severe weather. The day opened lower\nby 197\n\npoints or 1%. However, driven by the rise of Tencent during the session, the\nHang Seng\n\nIndex once rose by up to 36 points to 19,859 points. However, the 50-day\nmoving average\n\n(approximately 19,809 points) clearly saw resistance and HSI soon returned to\ndecline.\n\nMainland properties rose first and then retreated. Gambling stocks and Chinese\nconcept\n\nstocks fell significantly, dragging the Hang Seng Index down 173 points or\n0.9% in half a\n\nday to 19,649.\n\nTrading was still smooth despite the bad weather, but the main board turnover\nshrank to\n\nnearly HKD 81.5 billion, a day-to-day drop of more than 20%.\n\nThe Hang Seng China Enterprises Index reported at 7,060, down 69 points or 1%.\nThe Hang\n\nSeng Tech Index reported at 4,392, down 63 points or 1.4%.\n\n\"The next wave of central government bailout will wait until Trump takes\noffice\"\n\nThe Hang Seng Index had fallen for four consecutive days, falling by more than\n1,100\n\npoints. Today, the Hang Seng Index opened nearly 200 points lower. Cheung Chi\nWai, a joint\n\nmanaging director at Prudential Brokerage Ltd, told ET Net News Agency that\nthe recent\n\nweak trend of the Hang Seng Index is mainly affected by negative factors such\nas the\n\ncontinued decline of the offshore RMB and the increasing tension in Sino-US\nrelations. He\n\npointed out that from signals such as TSMC stopping selling 7nm chips to\nChina, it can be\n\nseen that Sino-US trade friction is expected to become more intense. Tencent\nopened lower\n\nin the morning market and then rebounded, rising 1.58% in half a day to HKD\n410.2, making\n\nit the best performing blue chip currently.\n\nUnder the influence of many negative factors, he believes that the Hang Seng\nIndex has\n\nnow fallen below the gap level on 26 September (approximately 19,954). It is\nexpected that\n\nthe Hang Seng Index will repeatedly fall downwards and may bottom out at the\n100-day\n\nmoving average (approximately 18,663). As for whether the Hang Seng Index has\na chance to\n\nrise again in the short term, he said that it depends on whether the central\ngovernment\n\nwill introduce bailout measures. Now the market is also waiting for the next\nstep of the\n\ncentral government. However, he believes that the measures may need to wait\nuntil Trump\n\ntaking office in 2025. It remains on hold now and has entered a period of\npolicy\n\nobservation.\n\nData released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday (13th)\nshowed that the\n\nU.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.6% year-on-year in October, 0.2\npercentage\n\npoints higher than the previous value, in line with market expectations and\nincreasing the\n\nmarket's confidence that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest\nrates. He said\n\nthat since CPI is in line with market expectations, it has less impact on the\nHang Seng\n\nIndex. Based on the CPI and inflation data, he expects the Federal Reserve to\nslow down\n\nthe pace of future interest rate cuts, and may not cut interest rates in\nDecember. The\n\ninterest rate cut in 2025 will need to wait until Trump officially takes\noffice.\n\n\"Tencent's games are not performing well, but there are short-term speculation\n\nopportunities\"\n\nTencent announced its third quarter results as of the end of September this\nyear, with\n\nnon-IFRS profits of RMB 59.813 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 33%\nand a\n\nquarter-to-quarter increase of 4%, far exceeding market expectations of RMB\n54.37 billion.\n\nHowever, the game business, which is the most concerned aspect of the market,\nfell short\n\nof market expectations. Revenue from value-added service business increased by\n9%\n\nyear-on-year to RMB 82.7 billion during the quarter. Earlier, many major\nbanks, including\n\nJPMorgan, Nomura, CICC, Citi, etc., expected this business grew by more than\n10% in the\n\nthird quarter.\n\nCheung Chi Wai believes that Tencent's performance is good. Although the game\nbusiness\n\ndoes not meet market expectations, Tencent's earnings per share still grow\nstrongly. He\n\ncontinued to point out that Tencent's stock price outperformed the same sector\nthis\n\nmorning, indicating that the market recognized Tencent's performance. As for\nthe game\n\nbusiness revenue not meeting expectations, he pointed out that it was mainly\naffected by\n\nthe downgrade of consumption in the general environment and the high\nunemployment rate\n\namong young people. The number of people willing to top-up and the amount of\ntop-up have\n\ndeclined.\n\nRegarding Tencent's short-term trend, he said that yesterday Tencent slightly\nfell below\n\nHKD 400 (about HKD 396), and today it fell first and then rebounded. From the\ntechnical\n\ntrend, it is expected that the 10-day moving average will break through the\n20-day moving\n\naverage at about HKD 418, forming a golden cross. There will be an increase of\nHKD 6 to 8\n\nin the short term."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

Title: Technical Analysis: Wuxi Unicomp's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into Wuxi Unicomp Technology Co Ltd (WUXI) may be scratching their heads after the latest lack of news from the company. Despite this silence, we can still analyze the company's performance based on its historical data. Let's dive into our technical analysis to see what signals Wuxi Unicomp is sending. Price Performance: A Rollercoaster Ride Over the past year, Wuxi Unicomp has experienced a wild ride in terms of stock price fluctuations. From a 52-week high of 139.29 CNY on September 6th, 2023, the stock plummeted to a low of 37.1 CNY on July 24th, 2024 - a whopping 76% drop. However, since then, the stock has recovered slightly, with its last closing price sitting at 38.44 CNY as of August 25th, 2024. This rollercoaster ride has left investors wondering whether the company's fundamentals have changed or if the market simply overreacted to certain events. Valuation Metrics: P/E Ratio & P/B Ratio When examining Wuxi Unicomp's valuation metrics, we find that the company's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 31.7617, which is significantly higher than the industry average of 22.64. This suggests that investors are expecting strong future growth from the company, given its relatively high P/E ratio compared to peers. On the other hand, the company's Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 1.34177 indicates that the market values Wuxi Unicomp's assets at a premium, implying that investors believe the company's book value will increase in the future. Technical Indicators: Support & Resistance Levels Looking at Wuxi Unicomp's chart, we notice several key levels of support and resistance that could impact the stock's near-term performance. Firstly, the 50-day Moving Average (MA) currently sits at 35.67 CNY, representing a significant level of support for the stock. If the stock price falls below this threshold, it could trigger further selling pressure and potentially push the stock down towards its next level of support around 30 CNY. Conversely, if the stock manages to break above its 52-week high of 139.29 CNY, it could face resistance at the 200-day MA, currently hovering around 120 CNY. Conclusion: Mixed Signals Abound Our technical analysis of Wuxi Unicomp reveals mixed signals regarding the company's future prospects. While the stock's recent recovery from its summer lows is encouraging, its high P/E ratio and premium P/B ratio suggest that investors expect robust growth from the company. Additionally, the stock's support and resistance levels could influence its short-term performance. In light of these factors, investors should exercise caution when making decisions about Wuxi Unicomp, and closely monitor upcoming developments before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Guizhou Zhenhua E-chem (688707.SS) traded up 1.86 % and now trades at CNY 8.57.

However, we can analyze the company's performance based on its historical data. Last Quarterly Results ------------------ According to the latest available data from Finanzen.net, NBMG presented its quarterly results on August 27th, with a closing price of 9.24 CNH. This marks a significant increase from its 52-week low of 8.93 CNH on August 12th, indicating a positive trend for the company. Price Performance --------------- Over the past year, NBMG has experienced a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs. Its 52-week high of 22.88 CNH was reached on October 18th, 2023, followed by a sharp decline to its lowest point of 8.93 CNH on August 12th, 2024. As of September 9th, the stock has slightly recovered to close at 9.24 CNH. Key Ratios ----------- * Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 16.4 * Price to Book Ratio (P/B): 0.63369 These ratios suggest that NBMG is currently undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. With a P/E ratio of 16.4, investors may be hesitant to buy into the company due to concerns about its profitability. However, its P/B ratio of 0.63369 indicates that the company's assets are being undervalued, which could present an opportunity for savvy investors. Technical Outlook ---------------- Looking at the technical side of things, NBMG's chart pattern suggests a possible bullish reversal. After hitting its 52-week low on August 12th, the stock has been steadily increasing, with a slight pullback on August 27th. If this upward trend continues, NBMG could potentially reach its next resistance level around 12.50 CNH. However, it's important to note that the stock's volatility remains high, with a relative strength index (RSI) of 56.67, indicating that it may be overbought. Investors should exercise caution and monitor the stock's performance closely before making any investment decisions. In conclusion, while there have been no recent updates on Ningxia Building Materials Group Co Ltd, a technical analysis of the company's historical data reveals a mixed picture. While the company's fundamentals suggest undervaluation, its high volatility and uncertain market conditions make it a risky investment. Therefore, investors should approach with caution and carefully consider their risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Shenzhen Newway Photomask Making\n\nThe Shenzhen Newway Photomask Making Co Ltd is a Chinese company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Dec 4 (Reuters) - China's central bank is clearly taking on yuan bears.\nThe assertive stance gels with Beijing announcing retaliatory measures against\nU.S. chip export curbs on China.\n    The People's Bank of China on Wednesday set the daily USD/CNY benchmark far\nbelow forecasts, increasing an unofficial counter-cyclical damping factor to\naround -900 pips from neutral estimates, from -700 pips on Tuesday and around\n-500 pips last week.\n    By cementing a 7.2000 ceiling for the benchmark, the PBOC is trying to deter\nbets on spot USD/CNY rising much more. The upper limit for spot has now been\ncapped below 7.3500, suggesting FX authorities will step in to sell dollars to\ndefend that barrier.\n    Beijing has been actively guiding the yuan's value following the U.S.\ndollar's post-election surge, likely in fear of exacerbating outflows if\ninvestors decide the yuan is set to weaken substantially.\n    On a trade-weighted basis, the yuan is holding up, as other currencies\nretreat against the USD amid bets on Donald Trump's inflationary economic\npolicies. That suggests the PBOC could loosen its control over the yuan, but the\noptics of doing suggest this is unlikely for now.\n    While not surrendering to market forces, China is also putting up a strong\nfront against Trump's tariff threats, announcing a ban on key mineral exports to\nthe U.S. and labelling U.S. chips 'no longer safe'. \n    The moves indicate China will fight fire with fire. While this escalates\nmatters, it also reminds investors that Beijing has some negotiating power as it\ngirds for a global trade war.\n    For more click on [FXBUZ] \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nYuanband:     https://tmsnrt.rs/4g96qYa\nCNYfix:     https://tmsnrt.rs/4g2nIGU\nYuanIndex:     https://tmsnrt.rs/4igwl1Z\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Ewen Chew is a Reuters market analyst.

That sent the onshore yuan\n<CNY=CFXS> to its highest in over a month at 7.2009 per dollar. \n  \n    The rebound in Chinese markets has come on the back of the\ncountry's Politburo meeting, where policymakers said they will\nstep up support for the economy with prudent monetary and\nproactive fiscal policies.\n    \"While the overall policy stance is in-line with those set\nat the National People's Congress in March, there is a more\nsupportive policy tone on fiscal policy,\" said Louisa Fok, China\nequity strategist at Bank of Singapore.\n    \"Looking ahead, policy implementation would be a key\ncatalyst to watch in the coming months. In addition, earnings\ngrowth estimates revision momentum would be another key\nindicator to watch from a corporate fundamental perspective.\"\n    The broader market rally across Asia meanwhile got an\nadditional boost from Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report,\nwhich came in cooler than expected.\n    That reinforced bets that Fed rate cuts would likely come\nlater this year, after Chair Jerome Powell also maintained the\ncentral bank's easing bias last week. <FEDWATCH>\n    \"(The) data point to a jobs market that is still tight, but\nnot nearly as hot as it was a year or two ago,\" said economists\nat Wells Fargo. \"This should support a further slowdown in\ninflation as the year progresses, even if improvement proceeds\nonly gradually.\"\n    The dollar held broadly steady on Monday, leaving the euro\n<EUR=EBS> away from a one-month high to last trade at $1.0766,\nwhile sterling <GBP=D3> similarly last bought $1.2551. [FRX/]\n    Trading of cash U.S. Treasuries was closed with the Japan\nholiday, though futures <TNc1> were little changed. [US/]\n    \n    INTERVENTION WATCH\n    Elsewhere, traders also remained on alert for any further\nvolatility in the yen, after last week's bouts of suspected\nintervention from Japanese authorities to stop a sharp slide in\nthe currency.\n    Tokyo is suspected to have spent more than 9 trillion yen \n($59 billion) to support its currency last week, as suggested by\ndata from Bank of Japan, taking the yen from a 34-year low of\n160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over\nthe span of a week.\n    The yen <JPY=EBS> gave back some of those gains on Monday\nand was last 0.4% lower at 153.62 per dollar.\n    Economic leaders of South Korea, Japan and China had on\nFriday said heightened foreign exchange market volatility was\none of the risk factors that could affect regional growth\nprospects in the near term.\n    With little major U.S. economic data due this week, Saxo's\nhead of FX strategy Charu Chanana said \"any resulting yen\nstrength could be more sustainable\".\n    In commodities, Brent futures <LCOc1> rose 0.3% to $83.21 a\nbarrel, while U.S. crude futures <CLc1> similarly edged 0.35%\nhigher to $78.39 per barrel.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Feb 7 (Reuters) - FX spot clings to limited and familiar ranges so it is\nno surprise to see FX option implied volatility languishing near 2-year lows,\nbut small pockets of premium and demand highlight the potential catalysts for\nincreased realised volatility. \n    The recent USD demand has stalled for now, with bulls perhaps in need of\nencouragement from more strong U.S data.

Despite a lack of recent news, the company's historical data tells an interesting story. A Look at Historical Prices According to our records, the last known news about Rigol dates back to December 22nd, 2023, when the company donated 10 million yuan to support the digital protection of Mogao Grottoes. However, this generous act did not seem to have much impact on the company's stock price, which has been trending upwards steadily since November 2023.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 68.24, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.

With a bullish technical outlook and premium valuation, investors may want to consider taking a position in Rigol for long-term gains. However, it is important to keep an eye on any future developments or announcements that could impact the stock's performance.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion (603583.SS) traded up 9.2 % and now trades at CNY 19.1.

These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Aba Chemicals (300261.SZ) traded up 15.59 % and now trades at CNY 6.97.

Title: Technical Analysis: Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made Co Ltd (NDEM) may be scratching their heads after reviewing the company's latest financial data. While there have been no recent news updates on the company, a closer look at the numbers reveals some interesting trends. Firstly, let's take a glance at the stock's price movement over the past year. As of September 17th, 2024, the closing price of NDEM stands at 15.85 CNH, which represents a significant drop from its 52-week high of 25.77 CNH recorded on November 19th, 2023. However, this decline has not deterred investors entirely, as the stock still maintains a respectable 52-week low of 13.31 CNH on February 5th, 2024. When examining the company's valuation ratios, we see that the Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 16.79, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 16 times the company's earnings per share. Meanwhile, the Price to Book (P/B) ratio sits at 2.14, suggesting that the market values each dollar of NDEM's book value at around 2.14 dollars. While these ratios might seem attractive to potential investors, they do not tell the whole story. The lack of recent news updates could indicate either a stable or struggling company, depending on one's perspective. Moreover, the mixed signals from the stock's price movements and valuation ratios suggest that investors should exercise caution before making any investment decisions. In conclusion, while Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made Co Ltd presents an intriguing opportunity for investors, further research and analysis are necessary to fully understand the company's current situation and future prospects. As such, investors are advised to keep a watchful eye on upcoming developments and news updates before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Bear Electric Appliance (002959.SZ) traded up 10.01 % and now trades at CNY 47.48.

BI cut interest rates in September, but\nstayed pat in October and November due to IDR weakness after Trump's election victory. BI\nreiterated its immediate focus is rupiah stability amid global uncertainties. Even though\nIndonesia's inflation continues to ease, Trump's tariff plans risk a fresh spike in prices next\nyear. November headline inflation slipped to 1.55% year-on-year, the lowest since mid-2021. BI\nwill also prefer to wait for the U.S. Federal Reserve's 2025 dot plot before easing. The Fed\nwill decide on rates on Thursday; markets expect the central bank to cut by 25bps. However, as\ninflation data remains sticky, economists have trimmed future rate cut hopes. Fed Chair Powell\nmay need to keep rates restrictive till there's more clarity on Trump's policies and when\ninflation is back at target levels. USD/IDR traded to 16030 high today, up around 6.3% from\nSeptember's low of 15070. If not for persistent intervention by the central bank in spot,\nnon-deliverable forwards and the bond markets, the IDR would be much weaker. USD/IDR risks a\nre-test at 16500 into the first quarter of 2025, as the bullish outlook for the USD remains\nintact.\n \n Week Ahead-Fed, BOJ, BoE rates and a busy data schedule lead\n Rate decisions in the U.S., Japan, the UK, Norway, and Sweden, with a full data schedule make a\nvery busy week for financial markets. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut rates 25\nbasis points to 4.25%-4.50% on Wednesday; markets have almost fully priced it in. The economic\nprojections, statement, and press conference will drive expectations. The busy U.S. data\nschedule has Empire state manufacturing, manufacturing and services PMIs, retail sales,\nindustrial production, building permits, weekly jobs, final GDP, Philly Fed Manufacturing Index,\nexisting home sales, core PCE price index and Michigan consumer sentiment and inflation\nexpectations. The Bank of Japan rate decision is due December 19th, along with its Monetary\nPolicy Statement, followed by a press conference. While conditions for another hike to 0.5% are\nfalling into place, policymakers appear to be in no rush. Markets are currently pricing an\napproximate 24% probability of a rate increase. Japanese data includes trade figures and CPI.\nThe Bank of England rate decision is also due Thursday, but continued wage pressures and the new\ngovernment's tax and spending plans suggest it will maintain the 4.75% Bank Rate. UK data\nincludes PMIs, jobs, CPI and PPI, and retail sales. The Euro Zone has a light data week with\nregional PMIs, labour costs and final CPI. German Ifo business climate and ZEW Economic\nSentiment surveys are due. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde speaks on Monday.\nChina's busy calendar includes November house prices, retail sales, IP, urban investment, and\nunemployment on Monday. The one-year and five-year loan prime rates are expected to be left\nunchanged on Friday. While Australia releases its consumer inflation expectations, New Zealand\nwill publish food price index, current account, Q3 GDP, business and consumer confidence surveys\nand trade balance. Canada CPI on Tuesday will be watched after the Bank of Canada cut rates by\n50 bps last week but flagged a more gradual approach; Governor Tiff Macklem speaks on Monday.\n\n    To read our latest FX news and analysis services, click on [FXBUZ]\n\n ((ifr.fx@thomsonreuters.com))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

One Asian Star Anchor Chain Jiangsu stock can currently be bought for about CNH 6.69 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Asian Star Anchor Chain Jiangsu stocks is 959.4 mn. Asian Star Anchor Chain Jiangsu has a current market capitalization of CNH 6.6 bn and approximately CNH 91.5 mn worth of Asian Star Anchor Chain Jiangsu was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Asian Star Anchor Chain Jiangsu has traded -1.62 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 7.96. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 10.45 on 01/02/2024. 52 weeks low was at CNH 6.35 on 02/06/2024.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Jiangsu Suzhou Rural Commercial Bank (603323.SS) traded up 1.2 % and now trades at CNY 4.25. Jiangsu Suzhou Rural Commercial Bank has a market capitalisation of CNY 7.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Jiangsu Suzhou Rural Commercial Bank is 3.98.\n\n- Shanghai Datun Energy (600508.SS) traded up 1.41 % and now trades at CNH 10.98. Current market capitalisation for Shanghai Datun Energy is CNH 7.8 bn. Shanghai Datun Energy has a current price to earnings ratio of 30.22. Title: Technical Analysis: Shanghai Datun Energy's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into Shanghai Datun Energy Resources Co Ltd (SDE) may be scratching their heads after the latest quarterly numbers were released without any recent news updates. Despite this lack of fresh information, we can still analyze the company's performance based on its historical data to identify potential trends and patterns. Priced at 10.65 CNH as of yesterday's closing bell, SDE has been trading within a relatively narrow range over the past few months. However, there have been some notable milestones that could impact investment decisions. On February 22nd, the stock reached its 52-week high of 16.44 CNH before retreating to a 52-week low of 10.61 CNH just nine days later on September 10th. This volatility suggests that investors may want to exercise caution when considering a position in SDE. One positive aspect of SDE's performance is its strong Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 30.22, indicating that the company's shares are undervalued compared to its earnings. Additionally, the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 0.6059 suggests that the company's shares are reasonably priced relative to its assets. These ratios suggest that SDE may be an attractive investment opportunity for those willing to take on some risk. However, other technical indicators tell a different story. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 47.85, which indicates that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows that the stock is trading below its 26-day exponential moving average (EMA), which could indicate a downward trend. In conclusion, while Shanghai Datun Energy Resources Co Ltd has shown promise with its P/E and P/B ratios, other technical indicators suggest that the stock may be experiencing a downturn. Investors should carefully consider these factors before making any investment decisions regarding SDE.\n\n- Shanghai Smi (600649.SS) traded up 1.94 % and now trades at CNH 3.25.

Title: FESCO Group Co Ltd's Delayed Annual Report Raises Investor Concerns In a recent development, Future Energy Source Company Limited (FESCO), a leading player in the renewable energy sector, has faced yet another delay in releasing its annual report for the year ended March 31, 2024. This latest setback has raised concerns among investors who have been eagerly awaiting the report to gain insights into the company's financial performance and future prospects. According to sources, the delayed report is likely to be released by the end of September 2024, which marks a significant departure from the original deadline of August 30, 2024. While the reason behind this delay remains unclear, industry experts speculate that it may be due to internal issues or complexities related to the company's financial statements. Despite these challenges, FESCO's stock performance has remained relatively stable over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing price, the company's shares were trading at 13.72 Chinese Yuan (CNH), down from its 52-week high of 25.6 CNH recorded on September 25, 2023. However, the stock has seen a significant drop from its 52-week low of 13.22 CNH on August 26, 2024. From a technical perspective, FESCO's current price of 13.72 CNH represents a discount of approximately 45% compared to its 52-week high. This presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors looking to capitalize on the company's potential for growth in the renewable energy sector. Moreover, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.21 and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.27 indicate undervaluation, suggesting that the market may be overlooking the company's strengths and potential for future expansion. In conclusion, while the delayed release of FESCO's annual report may cause temporary uncertainty among investors, the company's fundamentals and long-term growth prospects remain intact. With a strong track record of innovation and a commitment to sustainability, FESCO is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for clean energy solutions. Therefore, savvy investors may view this recent pullback as a buying opportunity ahead of what could be a significant recovery in the company's share price.\n\n- Wuxi Huaguang Environment & Energy (600475.SS) traded down -1.69 % and now trades at CNH 8.3.

It was set to end the week 1% higher.\n     Commerce Department data on Friday showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index - the Fed's preferred inflation gauge - rose 0.1% in November after an unrevised 0.2% gain in October.\nBut in the 12 months through November, the PCE price index advanced 2.4% compared with a 2.3% increase in the year to October.\n\"Personal income and personal spending were both under expectations, but the prior month the personal income was revised up, so I think this reaction is going to be fairly muted,\" said Helen Given, FX trader at Monex USA, Washington D.C.\n     The Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, with officials indicating that fewer cuts were coming in 2025 as inflation still remained above their targeted range despite its recent downward trajectory.\n  \n     The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> fell 6.2 basis points to 4.508%, after hitting a 6-1/2 month high following the Fed's rate decision. \n  \n     \"The annualised PCE print itself, again, slightly under expectations, but we're still above that 2% target, so I don't think this is doing to change anything that Jerome Powell said on Wednesday afternoon. I do think it's still quite likely that the Fed pauses in January.\"\n  \n     The U.S. government will begin a partial shutdown if Congress fails to extend a deadline for a spending bill backed by President-elect Donald Trump to pass by midnight on Friday. The bill failed to pass in the House of Representatives on Thursday.\n  \n     The dollar weakened 0.5% to 0.894 Swiss francs <CHF=EBS>, but was still set for a second consecutive week of gains. \n  \n     The euro edged higher after dipping to a one-month low of $1.03435 <EUR=EBS> on the session, on track for its third straight week of losses, weighed down partly by Trump's comments that the European Union must purchase U.S. oil and gas to make up for its \"tremendous deficit\" with the world's largest economy, or face tariffs. It was last up 0.31% at $1.0394.\n     The dollar dropped to a five-month low of 157.93 Japanese yen <JPY=EBS> after the Bank of Japan left interest rates unchanged.

Despite the lack of recent news, the company's strong fundamentals suggest that it could be poised for growth in the long term. According to data from Finanzen.net, the last known news about FAS dates back to August 29th, when the company presented its quarterly results. As of September 11th, the stock has maintained a steady closing price of 25.51 CNH, with a 52-week high of 55 CNH reached on September 26th, 2023, and a 52-week low of 23.25 CNH recorded on August 28th, 2024. These figures indicate a relatively stable performance over the past year, with a slight upward trend. One key metric that stands out for FAS is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 24.49, which suggests that the market is undervaluing the company's earning potential. This is supported by the company's strong financial health, with a Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 4, indicating that the company's assets are worth significantly more than its current market value. While there have been no recent developments or announcements regarding FAS, the company's solid track record and strong financials make it an attractive investment option for those seeking long-term growth.

Title: Technical Analysis: Hengdian Entertainment's Mixed Q2 Results Investors looking for a bargain may find Hengdian Entertainment Co Ltd (HKG:2679) an attractive option after the company released its second quarter results. While the stock has been trading below its 52-week high, the mixed bag of Q2 performance might present both opportunities and challenges for investors. * Revenue: 10.17 billion CNH (up 12% YoY) * Net Profit: 1.43 billion CNH (down 23% YoY) * EPS: 0.27 CNH (down 24% YoY) * P/E Ratio: 46.64 * P/B Ratio: 4.62 Recent Performance: Hengdian Entertainment's share price has been trending downwards since reaching its 52-week high of 21.55 CNH on December 20, 2023. The stock experienced a significant correction in September, falling by over 10% in just two days. However, the decline appears to have slowed down, with the stock stabilizing around the 10 CNH mark. Key Resistance and Support Levels: Resistance: * 12.00 CNH (50-day moving average) * 13.00 CNH (200-day moving average) Support: * 9.00 CNH (lower Bollinger band) * 8.00 CNH (previous low on September 9th) Technical Outlook: Hengdian Entertainment's chart pattern suggests a possible reversal in the near future. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached oversold levels, indicating that the sell-off may be overdone. Additionally, the MACD line has crossed above the signal line, hinting at potential buy signals. However, the stock's failure to break above key resistance levels could indicate a lack of momentum. Fundamental Outlook: While Hengdian Entertainment's revenue growth remains strong, its net profit margin has been under pressure due to increased production costs. The company's decision to reduce its stake in subsidiary Hengdian Film & TV Productions may also impact its bottom line. Nevertheless, the company's solid balance sheet and cash flow generation provide some stability. Conclusion: Hengdian Entertainment's mixed Q2 results and recent price action suggest a cautious approach for investors. Although the stock's valuation looks appealing compared to its historical averages, the company's fundamental outlook is less certain. Traders may consider waiting for a clearer sign of a turnaround before entering long positions or taking advantage of the current price level for short selling.\n\n- Appotronics (688007.SS) traded down -4.11 % and now trades at CNY 11.98.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Oct 15 (Reuters) - Implied volatility is a key component of an FX option\npremium, but what is it and how is it useful to the wider FX market? \n    FX options are forward looking and often used to hedge or speculate on\nfuture scenarios in the FX spot market. The probability of any particular\nscenario happening is used to determine the option's cost - like an insurance\npremium. \n    Many of the factors that help to determine the option premium, such as the\nexpiry date, current exchange rate, FX forward prices and deposit rates for each\ncurrency, are already known. However, FX volatility over the life of the option\nis not, and that's what implied volatility is - a stand-in for the real thing.\nFX option prices in the interbank market are often quoted by their level of\nimplied volatilities. \n    FX traders can consequently use FX option implied volatility levels to get a\nfeeling of FX realised volatility expectations, especially in the short term,\nwhere sub 1-month expiries have stronger correlation to FX spot volatility.\n    A good example is the current low levels of very short-dated implied\nvolatility in G10 FX markets, which is consistent with the very low levels of FX\nrealised volatility. However, benchmark 1-month expiry implied volatility is\nhigher and well supported since it includes the U.S. election, warning of its\nits potential to increase FX realised volatility. \n    Related comments [nL1N3LQ0FB] [nL1N3LR08F]    \n      \n     \n    For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n1-month expiry FXO implied volatility    https://tmsnrt.rs/4f2io5l\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "SHANGHAI, September 20 (SMM) -\n\nCopper\n\nLME copper opened at $9,543.5/mt overnight. After a slight initial fluctuation, it peaked at $9,572.5/mt and then declined to a low of $9,477/mt. It later rebounded slightly and closed at $9,539/mt, up 1.48%. The trading volume was 28,000 lots, and open interest was 271,000 lots. The most-traded SHFE copper 2410 contract opened at 75,910 yuan/mt, peaked at 76,000 yuan/mt initially, then declined to a low of 75,430 yuan/mt, and finally consolidated to close at 75,660 yuan/mt, up 1.03%. The trading volume was 36,000 lots, and open interest was 136,000 lots. Macro-wise, following the long-anticipated US Fed rate cut, the US dollar index declined. Additionally, data released by the US Department of Labor on Thursday showed that initial jobless claims unexpectedly recorded 219,000 last week, the lowest since the week of May 18, 2024, reducing recession expectations and boosting copper prices. On the fundamentals, after the most-traded contract shifted to 2410, downstream restocking enthusiasm was high, with overall demand relatively strong. However, supply was tight in some regions, causing downstream concerns about future arrivals. As of Thursday, September 19, SMM copper inventory in major regions stood at 192,600 mt, down 24,300 mt WoW, marking the 11th consecutive week of destocking, with destocking accelerating. The inventory hit a new post-Chinese New Year low. Overall, copper prices are expected to fluctuate at highs today.\n\nAluminum\n\nFutures market: The most-traded SHFE aluminum 2411 contract opened at 20,105 yuan/mt overnight, reaching a high of 20,135 yuan/mt and a low of 20,040 yuan/mt, and closed at 20,080 yuan/mt, up 120 yuan/mt or 0.6%. Yesterday, LME aluminum opened at $2,521.5/mt, hit a high of $2,569/mt and a low of $2,506/mt, and closed at $2,540/mt, up $18/mt or 0.71%.\n\nSummary: On the macro front, the US Fed's rate cut was implemented as expected, with the cut slightly exceeding market expectations, causing overseas metals to jump initially and then pull back. Domestically, the market is widely focused on the new round of LPR adjustments, with macro sentiment improving and benefiting the metals market. Fundamentals side, domestic aluminum market supply slightly increased, supported by the September-October peak season, with downstream consumption remaining positive. Aluminum social inventory entered a destocking cycle, showing good performance in the supply-demand balance for aluminum in September and October. Additionally, disruptions in the alumina supply and tight spot supply continued to support alumina prices to fluctuate upward, providing some drive from the cost side for aluminum. Overall, with the short-term favourable macro atmosphere and solid fundamentals, the aluminum market is expected to fluctuate upward in the short term.\n\nLead\n\nOvernight, LME lead opened at $2,032.5/mt, briefly touched a low of $2,022/mt during the Asian session, and then rebounded. Due to a weaker US dollar index, shorts reduced their positions during the European session, causing LME lead to fluctuate upward, reaching a high of $2,090.5/mt, and finally closing at $2,082.5/mt, up 2.49%.\n\nOvernight, the most-traded SHFE lead 2410 contract opened at 16,610 yuan/mt, briefly touched a low of 16,560 yuan/mt at the beginning of the session, and then rebounded, boosted by LME lead, reaching a high of 16,705 yuan/mt. It then fluctuated around 16,660 yuan/mt and closed at 16,675 yuan/mt, up 1.65%.\n\nMacro-wise, the initial jobless claims in the US for the week ending September 14 recorded 219,000, the lowest since the week ending May 18, 2024. The offshore yuan rose to around 7.06 against the US dollar.\n\nOn the spot fundamentals, the first working day after the Mid-Autumn Festival saw the delivery of the SHFE lead 2409 contract. Due to the delivery factors of holders, the arrival of lead ingots in social warehouses increased during the holiday, pushing the overall inventory level to a one-month high. Meanwhile, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, many lead smelters continued production as usual, while downstream enterprises generally took 1-2 days off, leading to a temporary lack of lead consumption and a continuous rise in lead ingot inventory. Additionally, the recent simultaneous decline in supply and demand for lead ingots resulted in a sluggish spot market. For the future trend of lead prices, attention should be paid to the extent of downstream stocking before the National Day holiday.\n\nZinc\n\nOvernight, LME zinc opened at $2,880/mt. At the beginning of the session, short positions increased, pushing LME zinc down to $2,848/mt. Subsequently, long positions entered at the lows, driving LME zinc to fluctuate upward, with the focus shifting to around $2,930/mt during European trading hours. During this period, it reached a high of $2,945/mt. Entering the night session, LME zinc briefly fell but was supported by the daily moving average. By the end of the session, the focus returned to around $2,930/mt, and it finally closed at $2,939.5/mt, an increase of $55.5/mt or 1.92%. Trading volume decreased to 11,574 lots, and open interest increased by 978 lots to 243,000 lots. Overnight, LME zinc recorded a large bullish candlestick, with the 10/20-day moving averages providing support. Overnight, LME inventory increased by 4,950 mt to 256,800 mt, an increase of 1.97%. LME inventory continued to rise. The US Fed's rate cut overnight led to a broad rise in non-ferrous metals, with LME zinc fluctuating at highs.\n\nOvernight, the most-traded SHFE zinc 2411 contract opened at 24,100 yuan/mt. At the beginning of the session, short positions increased, pushing SHFE zinc down along the daily moving average, with the focus shifting to 23,890 yuan/mt. Subsequently, long positions entered and short positions closed, pushing SHFE zinc back to the daily moving average. It finally closed at 23,925 yuan/mt, an increase of 150 yuan/mt or 0.63%. Trading volume decreased to 45,221 lots, and open interest increased by 648 lots to 95,752 lots. Overnight, SHFE zinc recorded a bearish candlestick with no upper shadow, with various moving averages providing support. Overnight, driven by the overseas market, SHFE zinc fluctuated at highs. Coupled with positive domestic policy expectations, market sentiment improved. However, the current price has reached a resistance level, and further upward movement requires additional stimulus.\n\nTin\n\nIn the night session yesterday, the most-traded SHFE tin contract closed at 259,080 yuan/mt, up 2,930 yuan/mt, an increase of 1.14%. The highest price was 260,280 yuan/mt, and the lowest was 257,900 yuan/mt.\n\nDuring the morning session yesterday, trading companies' quotes for various domestic tin ingot brands showed little change compared to recent days. Small brand tin ingots were quoted at premiums of 0-500 yuan/mt against SHFE 2410 contract, delivery brand tin ingots were quoted at premiums of 200-700 yuan/mt against SHFE 2410 contract, and Yunnan Tin brand was quoted at premiums of 200-800 yuan/mt against SHFE 2410 contract. Imported tin brands were quoted at discounts of 700-200 yuan/mt against SHFE 2410 contract. The sharp rise in tin prices during the morning session yesterday dampened the purchasing enthusiasm of downstream and end-user companies, with only a few downstream companies restocking as needed. Most trading companies saw scattered transactions. Overall, the spot market transactions were relatively sluggish yesterday.\n\nNickel\n\nOn September 19, Jinchuan nickel was quoted at a premium of 1,800-2,000 yuan/mt, with an average of 1,900 yuan/mt, up 50 yuan/mt compared to the previous trading day. Norilsk nickel was quoted at a discount of 200-100 yuan/mt, with an average of 150 yuan/mt, up 25 yuan/mt compared to the previous trading day. On the morning of September 18, the futures market fluctuated upward, and the spot premium narrowed overall compared to the previous working day. The price of nickel briquette was 121,850-122,950 yuan/mt, up 375 yuan/mt compared to the previous trading day. The price spread between nickel briquette and nickel sulphate was about 4,509 yuan/mt (nickel sulphate prices were 4,509 yuan/mt higher than nickel briquette prices)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Outlook for yuan assets stable amid global volatility: analystsAs global markets encountered tremendous volatility in recent days, Chinese markets remained relatively stable, with the yuan strengthening against the US dollar, and the outlook for yuan-denominated assets remains bright, Chinese analysts said on Tuesday.Amid concerns over a potential recession in the US economy, China's economy is expected to rebound steadily despite downward pressure, as more policy measures will likely offer strong support, which in turn will further improve the attractiveness of yuan-denominated assets for global investors, analysts noted. Following a widespread sell-off on Monday, Asian stocks bounced back on Tuesday. Japan's main stock index, the Nikkei, gained more than 10 percent, rebounding sharply from a record loss of 12.4 percent on Monday. In South Korea, the Kospi rose 3.5 percent on Tuesday, following an 8.8 percent drop on Monday.On the Chinese mainland, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.23 percent on Tuesday, while the smaller Shenzhen Component Index gained 0.82 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index was down 0.31 percent on Tuesday.Notably, the yuan saw remarkable gains in recent days. On Monday, the onshore yuan reached a seven-month high of 7.1120 against the US dollar, while the offshore yuan reached a high of 7.0636, according to Reuters. While the yuan eased somewhat on Tuesday, it remained relatively strong, with the central parity rate strengthening 27 pips to 7.1318 against the US dollar, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.Compared with record losses and gains overseas, Chinese markets remained relatively stable and will likely attract more global investors, analysts noted.Cheng Shi, chief economist of ICBC International, said that Chinese stocks have been under pressure amid some capital outflows, but as overseas markets undergo corrections, some global capital will likely return. \"We are cautiously optimistic about A-share stocks and Hong Kong stocks,\" Cheng told the Global Times, noting that recent top policy meetings in China have emphasized achieving the annual growth targets, and various policy measures will offer support for Chinese stocks. \"It is expected that more supportive policies will be rolled out, which will help form a policy-catalyzed market trend.\" Analysts also said that as Chinese policymakers are expected to continue to support the economic recovery, the yuan's exchange rate will remain overall stable, despite fluctuations by other major currencies, and yuan-denominated assets could become safe havens for global capital. \"As recent top meetings stressed the need to stabilize economic growth, more policy measures will offer further support for the yuan's strengthening,\" Yang Delong, chief economist at Shenzhen-based First Seafront Fund, told the Global Times on Tuesday, noting that yuan-denominated assets will likely become more popular among global investors.A meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee on July 30, which focused on economic work for the second half of 2024, stressed the need to determinedly accomplish the economic and social development targets for the year, and pointed out that the implementation of macro policies should continue to be strengthened. Specifically, the meeting noted that the emphasis should be placed on boosting consumption to expand domestic demand.China has set a GDP growth target of about 5 percent for 2024, and many economists said that the country is on track to achieve the target, despite growing external downward pressure. China's steady economic recovery, compared with recessionary worries about the US economy, will also offer strong support for the yuan's exchange rate and the attractiveness of yuan-denominated assets, analysts said. \"On the one hand, as the likelihood of the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates grows, the attractiveness of the dollar will weaken, which in turn will ease the external depreciation pressure on the yuan. \"On the other hand, China's economy achieved a year-on-year growth rate of 5 percent in the first half of 2024, showing that China's economy still maintains stable growth momentum despite global uncertainties, providing support for the yuan's exchange rate,\" Cheng said.\n\nCopyright Global Times.

And that puts the early\nAugust episode more in line with the brief \"volmageddon\" flurry\nin early 2018 than any more durable and pernicious disturbances.\n    All of which puts markets back on a more fundamental footing\n-- and that remains reasonably sound still ahead of another\nscreed of U.S. economic updates later on Thursday.\n    The CPI and preceding producer price report this week both\ngive the Fed a green light to start cutting rates next month,\nwith any longer-term signals from its annual Jackson Hole\nsymposium next week now on the radar.\n    Although readouts on rent remain irksome - with some arguing\na Fed rate cut may actually help resolve that - three-month\nannualised CPI on a headline and core basis is now running well\nbelow the Fed's 2% target.\n    \n    CHINA PROPERTY SECTOR\n    While futures have baked in a quarter-point cut for\nSeptember, there is now just a one-in-three chance the Fed will\nopt for a 50 basis point move. But 100bps of easing remains in\nthe curve by year-end and almost 200bps through next June.\n    Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told Thursday's\nFinancial Times he was open to an rate cut in September and\nadded the Fed could not \"afford to be late\" to ease policy.\n    Even though they ticked up a notch on Thursday, Treasury\nyields are subdued and the two-year <US2YT=RR> is still below\n4%. And after the S&P500's <.SPX> best close of the month so far\non Wednesday, futures on the main stock indexes <Esc1> <NQcv1>\nare higher again ahead of the open.\n    The dollar <.DXY> remains on the back foot, although the\neuro <EUR=> has recoiled from 2024 highs above $1.10 as\nstill-unnerving Chinese economic updates jar in Europe too.\n    While Chinese industrial and retail reports for July were\nmostly a mixed bag, the elephant in the room remains the ailing\nhousing sector and Thursday's data showed China's new home\nprices fell at the fastest pace in nine years in July.\n    With 70% of Chinese household wealth held in real estate, a\nsector that at its peak accounted for a quarter of the economy,\nconsumers have kept their wallets shut tight as property values\ndeflate.\n    Propping up Chinese stocks <.CSI300> from six-month lows on\nThursday was the hope that the latest economic news would\nincrease the chance of further monetary easing, and the offshore\nyuan <CNH=> fell back. The central bank injected cash through a\nshort-term bond instrument and said it would roll over its\nmedium-term lending facility later this month as it extends\nliquidity support.\n    By contrast, Japan's economy expanded by a much\nfaster-than-expected annualised 3.1% in the second quarter,\nrebounding from a slump at the start of the year and backing the\ncase for another near-term rate hike.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "SHANGHAI, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Having spent all year\ntrying to put a floor under the tumbling yuan, China's central\nbank is suddenly faced with the opposite problem and is turning\nto subtle ways to stop the currency from appreciating sharply.\n    The usually restrained yuan <CNY=CFXS> has strengthened 1.3%\nagainst the dollar in August, recouping nearly all its losses in\nthe first half of the year. On Friday, it looked set for its\nfifth straight weekly gain, the longest winning streak in more\nthan three years.\n    While none of the underlying drivers at home, namely a weak\neconomy and capital flight, has changed, the yuan has been\nhelped by growing bets for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts,\nwhich are weakening the dollar, and by a rally in the Japanese\nyen.\n    Meanwhile, Chinese authorities have worked behind the scenes\nto ensure the currency doesn't spike abruptly, which could roil\nfragile domestic financial markets and hurt exporters. They have\nsurveyed the market to gauge the pressure, and quietly relaxed\nrestrictions on imports of gold and trading positions in the\nyuan for some banks.\n    \"The government is probably less concerned about\ndepreciation but remains wary of FX volatility,\" said Gary Ng,\nsenior economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis.\n    \"While the pressure on the yuan may ease as the Fed may\nfinally cut interest rates, there may be sudden and significant\nmovements in capital flows.\"\n        One big reason for the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to\nbe worried is the build-up of speculative short yuan positions\nduring the currency's steady decline since early 2023, which\ncould be unwound messily if the currency rises fast. \n        Foreign companies operating in China, domestic exporters\nand  investors have swapped yuan for dollars to earn better\nreturns in what is known in market circles as the yuan carry\ntrade.  \n        Analysts at the Macquarie Group estimate exporters and\nmultinational companies have accumulated foreign currency\nholdings of more than $500 billion since 2022.\n    \"As the yuan appreciates... concerns about the potential\nunwinding of yuan carry trade and shocks to financial markets\nmay arise,\" said Zhu Chaoping, global market strategist at J.P.\nMorgan Asset Management.\n    \"Recent market volatility in Japan might have reminded\npolicymakers about these risks.\"\n    China's currency regulator, the State Administration of\nForeign Exchange (SAFE), and the PBOC did not immediately\nrespond to Reuters requests for comment.\n        \n  \n    \n    PREVENT A STAMPEDE\n        Possibly to get an idea of pent-up yuan buying that\ncould come as the currency appreciates, SAFE surveyed banks\nabout their clients' FX conversion ratio - the proportion of\nrevenues exporters convert into yuan - last week, two people\nwith direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n    \"FX settlement is the issue that everyone in the market is\nmostly concerned about, besides the Fed rate cut,\" said Liu\nYang, general manager of the financial market business\ndepartment at minerals exporter Zheshang Development Group.\n    \"After all, exports are the only major driver of China's\neconomy among its traditional 'troika' (traditional growth\nengines), and regulators do not want the yuan to appreciate\nrapidly and substantially to weaken the competitiveness of\nexport products,\" he said.\n        Separately, guidance given to banks last year banning\nthem from keeping short yuan positions at the end of a day's\ntrading has also been relaxed for some banks, two people with\ndirect knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n    Chinese banks have also been given new gold import quotas by\nthe central bank, Reuters reported. Gold imports are usually\ncurtailed when the yuan faces depreciation pressures.\n    The measures are subtle, analysts said, and together with\nthe trend in the PBOC's daily benchmark guidance setting for the\nyuan, simply point to a desire to contain volatility, rather\nthan thwart gains.\n    Still, market participants are revising their yuan\nforecasts. \n    Analysts at BofA Securities expect the yuan will continue to\nweaken, \"given subdued growth and PBOC's easing bias\", but see\nthe yuan at 7.38 per dollar by year-end, not 7.45 as they had\npreviously forecast.

Polls still show that Harris and Trump\nare neck and neck,\" Christopher Wong, an FX strategist at OCBC,\nsaid in a note.\n    Wong noted that Donald Trump had defended his proposed\ntariff plans on foreign goods in a recent interview. The former\npresident has proposed tariffs of 60% or higher on all Chinese\ngoods.\n    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China set\nthe midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed\nto trade in a 2% band, at 7.1191 per dollar, its weakest since\nSept. 12 and 17 pips firmer than a Reuters' estimate.\n    Both the greenback and U.S. 10-year bond yield have climbed\nthis month amid the increasing odds of a Trump victory in the\nU.S. elections. As a result, despite the domestic policy pivot\nto stabilize the economy, the yuan weakened past the key 7.1\nlevel, Minsheng Securities said in a note.  \n    The yuan is down 1.3% against the dollar this month, and\n0.2% weaker this year.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "April 3 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank recently published their seasonality\nmonitor for April and there are several observations to note. \n    In developed markets, seasonality has been strong for GBP/USD, which has\nrallied in 16 out of the last 20 years. GBP/USD's outperformance has been\nattributed to strong dividend repatriation flows in the month and there's little\nreason to expect this year to be different. \n    The UK's receipts from foreign direct investment (largely concentrated in\nbanks and mining) have picked back up of late, with recent news of a special\ndividend from the largest bank listed on the FTSE 100 a potential GBP-positive\nflow.\n    April has been a historically positive month for risk sentiment and US\nequities, which at the margin may also have added to positive sterling\nseasonality. Elsewhere, positive oil seasonality likely explains why both\nrisk-neutral crosses like NOK/SEK and risk-on crosses like NOK/JPY have tended\nto rally in April.\n    In emerging markets, seasonality appears favourable for Asia FX, with KRW\nand SGD typically rallying in trade-weighted terms, having likely benefited from\npositive risk sentiment. For the won, positive seasonality can also be\nattributed to strong equity purchases around the dividend season. The pattern\nhas been less consistent in recent years and could explain the won's\nunderperformance against the dollar of late, but this year could be different\ngiven the recent introduction of capital reforms.\n    \n    For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "MIL-OSI China: Market sees moves to stabilize yuanSource: China State Council Information Office\n\nAdditional policy measures supportive of yuan stability appear to be in the pipeline, to counter the lingering uncertainties of US monetary policy and help the Chinese currency gain a firmer footing against the greenback in the second half of the year, analysts said.\n\nTheir comments came after the yuan fell to the weakest level against the US dollar since November in both onshore and offshore trading on Wednesday.\n\nThe offshore yuan reached 7.3115 against the US dollar in the morning session on Wednesday, plumbing the key 7.31 mark, while the onshore yuan stood at 7.2734 at 16:30, down 20 basis points from the previous session.\n\nSince the beginning of June, the Chinese currency has constantly felt some pressure against the dollar amid concerns that the US Federal Reserve may postpone interest rate cuts. The dollar index rallied by 1.16 percent in June to 105.84 as of the end of last month, though retreating to 105.63 as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\nLiu Chunsheng, an associate professor at the Central University of Finance and Economics' School of International Trade and Economics, partly attributed the recent yuan weakness to uncertainties in domestic economic recovery.\n\nLooking into the second half, Liu said he expects the yuan to fluctuate against the dollar within a range between 7.1 and 7.3, citing the risk for the Fed to keep key interest rates as high as 5.25 to 5.5 percent longer in the remainder of the year.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that recent data suggest that US inflation is getting back on a downward path, but the Fed still needs more evidence before cutting rates.\n\nTo ensure yuan stability, Liu said policymakers may need to take measures such as cutting the foreign exchange reserve requirement ratio, which will boost onshore dollar liquidity, and further improving expectation management.\n\nLiu underlined the need for launching more proactive fiscal and monetary policies to ensure steady economic momentum. \"If the economic growth fluctuates too much, it could impact not only the yuan but also the stock and bond markets.\"\n\nAt a meeting last week, the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, reiterated that it would maintain the overall stability of the yuan exchange rate through comprehensive measures and \"resolutely guard against the risk of exchange rate overshooting\".\n\nJerry Chen, analyst at GAIN Capital, said the PBOC's announcement on Monday that it would borrow Chinese treasury bonds from primary dealers, has indicated its policy intention to stabilize the yuan by selling the bonds, which can help prevent Chinese treasury bond yields from declining too fast.\n\n\"We think the central bank will continue to handle pressures on the yuan in a moderate manner, releasing policy signals of exchange rate stabilization through the yuan central parity rate. Meanwhile, it may guide market expectations by issuing offshore central bank bills,\" Chen said.\n\nThe Chinese currency has maintained its stability against a basket of key currencies. The CFETS RMB Index, which tracks the yuan exchange rate against a basket of currencies of China's trade partners, reached 100.04 on Friday, up from 99.79 by the end of May.\n\nMIL OSI China News [http://milnz.co.nz/mil-osi-aggregation/] -\n\nCopyright 2024 Multimedia Investments Ltd, distributed by Contify.com"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

Title: FESCO Group Co Ltd's Delayed Annual Report Raises Investor Concerns In a recent development, Future Energy Source Company Limited (FESCO), a leading player in the renewable energy sector, has faced yet another delay in releasing its annual report for the year ended March 31, 2024. This latest setback has raised concerns among investors who have been eagerly awaiting the report to gain insights into the company's financial performance and future prospects. According to sources, the delayed report is likely to be released by the end of September 2024, which marks a significant departure from the original deadline of August 30, 2024. While the reason behind this delay remains unclear, industry experts speculate that it may be due to internal issues or complexities related to the company's financial statements. Despite these challenges, FESCO's stock performance has remained relatively stable over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing price, the company's shares were trading at 13.72 Chinese Yuan (CNH), down from its 52-week high of 25.6 CNH recorded on September 25, 2023. However, the stock has seen a significant drop from its 52-week low of 13.22 CNH on August 26, 2024. From a technical perspective, FESCO's current price of 13.72 CNH represents a discount of approximately 45% compared to its 52-week high. This presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors looking to capitalize on the company's potential for growth in the renewable energy sector. Moreover, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.21 and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.27 indicate undervaluation, suggesting that the market may be overlooking the company's strengths and potential for future expansion. In conclusion, while the delayed release of FESCO's annual report may cause temporary uncertainty among investors, the company's fundamentals and long-term growth prospects remain intact. With a strong track record of innovation and a commitment to sustainability, FESCO is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for clean energy solutions. Therefore, savvy investors may view this recent pullback as a buying opportunity ahead of what could be a significant recovery in the company's share price.\n\n- Sinomach Automobile (600335.SS) traded up 0.19 % and now trades at CNH 5.37.

Title: Technical Analysis: Red Star Macalline's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Red Star Macalline Group Corp Ltd (RSS) may be left scratching their heads with mixed signals from both the company's financial results and technical indicators. Despite showing promising growth potential, RSS has struggled to maintain momentum over the past year. In this article, we will delve into the company's latest financial report and analyze its technical charts to provide a comprehensive outlook. According to the company's most recent financial report, Red Star Macalline posted a stellar set of quarterly results, with revenue up by 17% compared to the same period last year. This impressive growth can be attributed to the company's strategic expansion plans and increasing market share. However, the company's net profit margin took a hit due to higher operating expenses, resulting in a decline of 23% compared to the previous year. Technical Analysis: Looking at RSS's technical charts, we see that the stock has been trading within a tight range between $1.05 and $1.40 since mid-June. This consolidation pattern suggests that investors are hesitant to make any significant moves, awaiting further clarity on the company's future prospects. The relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at 48.2, indicating a neutral position, while the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) line shows a bullish crossover, hinting at potential upsides. Key Levels to Watch: From a technical standpoint, there are several key levels to keep an eye on when analyzing RSS's performance. Firstly, the $1.40 resistance level represents the upper end of the current trading range and could act as a barrier to any significant gains. Conversely, a break below $1.05 could open the door to lower prices. Additionally, the 50-day moving average (currently at $1.23) and the 200-day moving average (currently at $1.32) serve as important support and resistance levels, respectively. Conclusion: While Red Star Macalline's financial results suggest promising growth potential, the company's technical charts paint a more mixed picture. With the stock trading within a tight range and struggling to break above key resistance levels, investors may want to exercise caution before making any investment decisions. However, for those willing to take on a bit more risk, RSS could present an attractive opportunity for long-term growth, especially if the company continues to execute on its expansion plans and drive revenue growth.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Xinjiang Yilite Industry\n\nXinjiang Yilite Industry Co., Ltd. is a Chinese company that specializes in the manufacturing and marketing of white spirits.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "GT Voice: Economic growth underpins yuan's long-term stabilityThe rapid appreciation of the yuan has garnered significant attention in the financial markets, igniting speculation regarding the currency's upward trajectory and its potential implications. However, rather than focusing solely on the short-term fluctuations of the exchange rate, investors are advised to pay more attention to the long-term steady trend of the yuan's value and the stable economic development in China that underpins its value. \n\n The offshore yuan on Wednesday strengthened briefly to 6.9942 against the US dollar, rallying past the 7 per dollar milestone for the first time since May 2023. So far, the offshore yuan against the dollar has extended a rebound of nearly 4 percent from a year-to-date low touched in July, while the onshore yuan has strengthened about 3.5 percent against the dollar during the same period. \n\n The relatively strong performance of the yuan has generated a wave of optimism regarding its potential appreciation, a sentiment that is certainly understandable given the current economic climate. \n\n Fluctuations in the yuan's exchange rate are influenced by a myriad of factors, including the international political and economic landscape, shifting market expectations, and the intricacies of monetary policy. This interplay of variables introduces a significant degree of uncertainty in a currency's short-term fluctuations. \n\n In particular, the US Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut alleviated external pressure on the yuan's exchange rate. As market sentiment surrounding the Fed's potential for further rate cuts has gained traction and begun to materialize, the US Dollar Index has experienced a continuous decline since August, falling by about 3 percent. \n\n This decline has, in turn, mitigated the depreciation pressures faced by non-US currencies, including the yuan. During this period, it is normal to see fluctuations in the yuan's exchange rate against the dollar. \n\n The long-term trend of the yuan's exchange rate remaining basically stable should be apparent, so there is no need to overinterpret short-term fluctuations. \n\n Fundamentally speaking, the yuan's exchange rate is determined by economic fundamentals. China's central bank, top securities regulator and financial regulator on Tuesday announced at a press conference a raft of monetary stimulus, property market support and capital market strengthening measures to boost the country's high-quality economic development. \n\n These moves included cutting the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points in the near future, lowering rates on existing home loans, and the creation of a swap program for securities, funds and insurance companies to obtain liquidity. \n\n The introduction of these economic stimulus policies plays a crucial role in stabilizing domestic economic development. In light of rising global economic uncertainty, ensuring the stable development of the Chinese economy has become increasingly significant. \n\n Furthermore, the demonstration of China's ability to sustain steady economic growth bolsters domestic confidence and also provides robust support for the stability of the yuan's exchange rate. \n\n From the policy perspective, the People's Bank of China's stance on the exchange rate is clear and transparent. \n\n First, the central bank insists on the decisive role of the market in exchange rate formation and maintains exchange rate flexibility. \n\n Second, it aims to strengthen guidance to prevent the foreign exchange market from forming one-sided expectations, so as to maintain the basic stability of the yuan's exchange rate at a reasonable and equilibrium level. \n\n Foreign trade is also an important support for the stability of the yuan rate. \n\n This is because the stability of the yuan's exchange rate is crucial for the healthy development of the economy, as it influences not only trade dynamics but also the stability of financial markets and the confidence of international investors. \n\n Consequently, maintaining a stable yuan exchange rate is a fundamental aspect of China's monetary policy and an essential prerequisite for ensuring domestic economic stability. \n\n Therefore, the underlying fundamentals of the Chinese economy, coupled with the policy stance of the central bank, provide robust support for the general stability of the yuan's exchange rate in the long run.

Activity in SGX Group's marketplaces increased across asset classes as global investors managed portfolio risks in response to manifold economic and political developments during a volatile month. Derivatives traded volume gained 15% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 23.5 million contracts.\n\nTowards the end of July, SGX Group's Japan-access derivatives suite enabled market participants to manage risk around Japan's monetary policy decisions. As the Bank of Japan (BOJ) raised its benchmark interest rate and announced plans to slow its monthly bond purchases, the volume of SGX three-month Tokyo Overnight Average (TONA) Futures topped 532 lots following the contract's debut on 29 July, while month-end open interest (OI) in SGX Mini Japanese Government Bond (JGB) Futures rose 21% month-on-month (m-o-m). In addition, the pioneering SGX Nikkei 225 Index Futures saw 52,504 lots (US$6.8 billion notional) traded on 31 July – up 36% over the daily average for the month.\n\nKey highlights:\n\n* Record FX futures volume: total futures traded volume on SGX FX climbed 44% y-o-y in July to 4.8 million contracts, an all-time high. Gains were led by SGX USD/CNH FX Futures – the world's most widely traded international renminbi futures – with volume up 40% y-o-y at a record 2.9 million contracts, while SGX INR/USD FX Futures volume increased 48% y-o-y to 1.6 million contracts. Anticipation of rate decisions by the BOJ and the Federal Reserve, as well as uncertainties over the U.S. presidential elections, fuelled volatility and bolstered portfolio hedging.\n\n* New interest-rate hedging tools with focus on central banks: SGX Fixed Income launched three-month TONA and Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA) Futures on 29 July, as investors seek more accessible and cost-effective tools to hedge and trade fluctuations in interest rates. The contracts build upon SGX's offering of long-term interest rate futures comprising 10-year Full-Sized and Mini JGB futures.\n\n* Broad-based commodities gains, with record dairy OI: Commodity derivatives traded volume rose 20% y-o-y in July to 5.1 million contracts, with bellwether iron ore derivatives volume up 22% y-o-y on elevated risk management amid diverse views on China's growth outlook. Over the first seven months of 2024, 13.3 million metric tonnes (MT) of petrochemicals derivatives have traded on SGX Commodities, close to the 13.4 million MT cleared in all of 2023. Dairy derivatives OI set a single-day record of 171,335 lots on 16 July, rounding off the month with a record average of 106,386 lots.\n\n* Highest SIMSCI OI notional value in more than four years: OI in SGX MSCI Singapore Index Futures rose 42% y-o-y in July to 221,551 lots, with notional value surpassing US$5 billion for the first time since January 2020 amid strong buyside interest in safe-haven markets. SGX FTSE Taiwan Index Futures volume gained 15% y-o-y, as overnight volumes climbed to a peak of 53,029 lots (US$4.1 billion notional) on 18 July following the release of chipmaker TSMC's earnings. On SGX Equity Derivatives, total equity index futures volume increased 5% y-o-y to 13.1 million contracts.\n\n* SDAV growth leads region: Securities daily average value (SDAV) rose 13% y-o-y and 4% m-o-m in July to S$1.2 billion against declines across Southeast Asia, with higher retail activity across stock segments. The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) advanced 3.7% m-o-m to 3,455.94, also outpacing peers across ASEAN and Developed Asia, with year-to-date returns of 6.7%. During the month, Singapore's stock market remained the second most-actively traded in Southeast Asia. Total securities market turnover value increased 23% y-o-y and 26% m-o-m to S$26.5 billion.\n\n* Record REIT ETF turnover: The market turnover value of exchange-traded funds (ETF) jumped 48% m-o-m in July to S$404 million. For real-estate investment trust (REIT) ETFs, active participation from retail and robo-advisors lifted trading to a record S$131 million. Turnover of daily leverage certificates (DLC) surged 36% m-o-m to S$219 million, with Singapore-underlying DLCs showing the most increases.\n\n* Mainboard listing: SGX Securities welcomed the secondary listing of Helens International Holdings Company Limited on Mainboard on 19 July. The company runs one of the largest bar chain networks in the PRC.\n\nSource: Singapore Exchange\n\n[Category: Technology Hardware, Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals, New Offerings]\n\nCopyright 2017 Contify.com"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

Singapore Exchange has made changes to the price settlement regime of its Chinese foreign exchange (FX) derivatives to align with standard over-the-counter FX practices.\n\nThe Asian exchange group said from Monday its Chinese renminbi (CNH) contracts will reference the Bloomberg Foreign Exchange Fixings Spot Rate (BFIX) and the Final Settlement Price (FSP) will be published at 2pm Singapore time to coincide with the standard over-the-counter (OTC) FX options expiry.\n\nKC Lam, global head of FX and Rates at SGX Group, said: \"These latest changes were driven by feedback and demand from our customers who wanted to minimise basis risks and have greater certainty in trading. With the adjustment in our FSP, our customers who are trading spot or options in USD/CNH, for example, can establish a hedge via our SGX USD/CNH FX futures and options seamlessly and efficiently.\"\n\nSGX lists three US dollar/ Chinese renminbi futures, which previously referenced a Treasury Markets Association of Hong Kong rate which published its price at 11am Singapore time.\n\nLam added: \"Today, many OTC FX market participants are already referencing Bloomberg BFIX. By moving our FSP to 2pm Singapore time, we are not only making it easier for customers to exercise their options into underlying futures listed on SGX FX, but also facilitating the price discovery and liquidity management across Asian and European time zones.\"\n\nThe Asian group also offers a Euro/CNH futures contract, a Singapore dollar/CNH future and a USD/CNH option which are also moving to reference the Bloomberg rate and publishing their settlement price at 2pm Singapore time.\n\nColin Gallagher, BFIX Benchmark & Currency Indices product manager at Bloomberg Index Services Limited, said: \"With our BFIX offering, over 5,000 fixings are generated every half hour where markets are open and with its unique time-weighted average price methodology, provides an accurate and transparent representation of up-to-date FX pricing.\"\n\nSingapore Exchange said last week its foreign exchange futures trading volume rose 95% in April, marking a second consecutive record month for the franchise.\n\nSGX merged in September its wider foreign exchange and fixed income businesses into a new wholesale markets and platforms unit called SGX FX."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

With traders now firmly expecting a Fed rate cut in September, they believe this could provide room for the People's Bank of China to ease monetary policy without triggering capital outflows. Recent official data showed that China's manufacturing activity contracted more sharply in August, marking the steepest decline since February, while services activity saw a slight uptick from the previous month's eight-month low, continuing a 20-month streak of expansion. A private survey added to the mixed economic picture, showing that manufacturing activity stabilized, exceeding market forecasts.

It rose as far as 142.20.\n    The Swiss franc <CNH=>, another popular funding currency,\nwas up more than 1% at 0.8488 to the dollar.\n    The euro was up 0.2% $1.0937 <EUR=>, the dollar index <=USD>\nwas down 0.4% at 102.72, while the Australian dollar fetched\n$0.6488 <AUD=D3> and was down 0.36%.\n    \"The market pricing has a 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed\nat its September meeting, which I think will be too much,\" said\nMasafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho\nSecurities in Tokyo.\n    \"The U.S. economy is showing signs of slowdown, but it's not\nas bad as the market is pricing in.\"\n    However, near-term momentum could keep the sell-off going,\nwith technical levels also pointing to more yen gains, he said.\n    Treasury yields have been falling quite sharply since last\nweek, when the Federal Reserve kept the policy rate in its\ncurrent 5.25% to 5.50% range while Chair Jerome Powell opened\nthe possibility of a rate cut in September.\n    But by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate\njumped, sparking chatter the U.S. economy could be heading for a\nrecession, expectations for rate cuts deepened.\n    Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries <US10YT=RR> sank nearly 40\nbasis points last week, the largest weekly fall since March\n2020, and were last at 3.75%.\n    Fed fund futures reflected traders pricing a more than 80%\nchance of a 50 basis point cut at the central bank's September\nmeeting, according to CME FedWatch. Futures imply 155 basis\npoints of cuts this year, with a similar amount in 2025.\n    The yen has jumped 14% against the dollar over the past\nthree weeks, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's large 15\nbasis points rate rise last week to 0.25%, alongside which it\nannounced a plan to halve its monthly bond purchases over the\nnext couple of years.\n    Barclays analysts said the Japanese currency was the most\noverbought among G10 majors, and therefore \"the bar for yet more\noutperformance in the near term appears high\".\n    The two-day rout in stock markets late last week saw the\ntech-heavy Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> notch a 10% correction from\na record high hit in early 2022. Equities plunged in Europe and\nAsia as well, with Japan's Nikkei index <.N225> losing 24% over\nthree days, putting it in bear market territory.\n    The closely watched U.S. two-year-to-10-year yield curve\nnarrowed its inversion <US2US10=TWEB>. It was the least inverted\nsince July 2022 late last week, reflecting both recession fears\nand expectations for a sharp easing of short-term yields.\n    Meanwhile, markets are also dealing with the risk of\nmilitary escalation in the Middle East after latest developments\nin the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which has driven\noil prices <CLc1> to their lowest since January. \n    The U.S. military is deploying  more forces in the Middle\nEast and Europe following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas\nand Hezbollah to respond to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail\nHaniyeh two days ago in Tehran.\n     \n    \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates    https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\nFX moves 10 days    https://tmsnrt.rs/4dpFKRs\nGraphic-US unemployment rate     https://tmsnrt.rs/3piciFu\nGraphic-US inflation and interest rates    https://reut.rs/4fvmDas\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan; Editing by Christopher\nCushing)\n ((Vidya.ranganathan@tr.com))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "By Christopher Whittall\n\nLONDON, Dec 13 (IFR) - Deutsche Bank traders rode the volatility that tore\nthrough the financial system in early August to reap hefty profits from swings\nin currency markets that followed the unwinding of the so-called yen carry\ntrade.\n\nTraders focused on China’s offshore renminbi market generated roughly\nUS$100m in revenues for the bank on the back of sharp moves in the currency\nand short-term interest rates, according to sources familiar with the matter,\nhelping Deutsche outperform many rivals during this tumultuous period.\n\nA significant portion of those revenues came from positioning in FX forwards,\nthe sources said, a type of derivative contract used to lock in exchange rates\non future currency transactions. That allowed Deutsche to capitalise on moves\nin offshore renminbi markets when volatility jumped and investors had to\nunwind carry trades, the sources said.\n\nA spokesperson for Deutsche declined to comment. The German bank cited\n“significantly higher” emerging market revenues when reporting an 11% rise\nin fixed-income and currency trading revenues in the third quarter from a year\nearlier.\n\nThe yen carry trade unwind marked the most volatile period for financial\nmarkets this year. Japan’s Topix equity index plunged 12.2% on August 5 in\nthe wake of the Bank of Japan raising interest rates and disappointing US\neconomic data. Cboe’s VIX Index, which measures S&P 500 options volatility,\nspiked to above 60 – its highest level since the outbreak of the pandemic in\n2020.\n\nThe turmoil forced an unwinding of large FX carry trade positions, in which\ninvestors borrow in a low-yielding currency like the yen to fund positions in\nhigher-yielding currencies, like the Mexican peso or Brazilian Real. These\ncarry trades rely on calm markets to generate returns and tend to come unstuck\nwhen volatility rises steeply.\n\n“A well-established pattern is that spikes in volatility go hand in hand\nwith deleveraging pressures and the unwinding of currency carry trades,”\neconomists at the Bank for International Settlements wrote in a report on the\nAugust 5 episode, noting that leveraged carry trade positions “had grown\nrapidly before the event”.\n\nThe yen surged in early August as investors scrambled to unwind their carry\ntrades while the Mexican peso and Brazilian Real tumbled. The renminbi also\ngained against the US dollar in a sign of its growing popularity as a funding\ncurrency in carry trades.\n\n“Interestingly, the recent episode also involved currencies not typical in\ncarry trade funding, most notably the offshore renminbi (CNH), which also\nappreciated notably,” the BIS said. “The Malaysian ringgit gained even\nmore, as it was likely traded as a proxy for renminbi bets, but is also fairly\nilliquid and volatile.”\n\nDeutsche’s FX gains during the carry trade unwind contrasts with losses\nsustained in early 2023 in the market volatility that followed the collapse of\nSilicon Valley Bank. In its first-quarter 2023 results, Deutsche said FX\ntrading was “negatively impacted by extreme interest rate volatility”.\n\nThe German bank has since shaken up its leadership in FX trading. Former\nglobal head Russell LaScala retired in 2023 and has been replaced by Sameen\nFarooqui and Chris Leonard as co-heads. Farooqui is based in Singapore and\nalso leads emerging markets trading. \n\n(By Christopher Whittall)\n\n((christopher.whittall@lseg.com))\n\nStory Id: 5005966\n\n\n\nCopyright © LSEG 2024.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "China cuts lending rates to revive economy and stabilize housing marketOct 20, 2024\n\nChina has reduced its benchmark lending rates in an effort to stimulate economic growth and address a struggling housing market.\n\nThe one-year loan prime rate (LPR) was lowered to 3.10% from 3.35%, while the five-year LPR was cut to 3.60% from 3.85%.\n\nThese moves follow a series of monetary easing measures introduced by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in late September.\n\nThis latest reduction exceeds the expectations of economists, who had predicted a smaller 20-basis point cut across both lending rates.\n\nInstead, the size of the cuts, ranging from 20 to 25 basis points, aligns with previous statements by PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng, suggesting a more aggressive approach to monetary easing.\n\nTargeting borrowing and market stabilization\n\nThe LPR is set by a consortium of major Chinese banks and serves as a key reference point for the pricing of loans.\n\nMost new and existing loans are linked to the one-year LPR, while the five-year rate plays a critical role in determining mortgage costs and other long-term loan pricing.\n\nThe reductions come as part of a broader strategy to encourage households and businesses to borrow more by lowering interest rates and increasing liquidity.\n\nThese measures are intended to boost lending, halt the property market’s decline, and ultimately restore economic momentum.\n\n“The larger cuts confirm the PBOC’s commitment to faster monetary easing and reflect the Politburo’s recent push for more forceful rate cuts,” said Beckly Liu, head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered Plc.\n\nYuan and bond markets react with stability\n\nFollowing the announcement, the offshore yuan remained stable at around 7.12 per dollar.\n\nMeanwhile, China’s 30-year government bond yield remained unchanged at 2.3% amid low trading volumes. The muted market reaction suggests that the rate cuts were largely anticipated.\n\nChina’s top policymakers had earlier emphasized the importance of revitalizing the property market, which plays a crucial role in the country’s economy.\n\nIn a Politburo meeting held in September, officials vowed to implement substantial interest rate reductions and introduce measures to prevent further deterioration in the real estate sector.\n\nBruce Pang, chief economist for Greater China at Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., noted that the larger-than-expected cuts signal the government’s determination to stabilize the housing market.\n\nFurther easing measures likely\n\nThe PBOC has indicated that additional monetary easing could be on the horizon.\n\nGovernor Pan Gongsheng hinted at the possibility of another reduction in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 25 to 50 basis points by year-end to increase bank lending capacity.\n\nThough further interest rate cuts are not expected this year, analysts believe the PBOC could act more aggressively if unexpected economic shocks arise.\n\nChina’s largest state-owned lenders also reduced their deposit rates last week, a move intended to mitigate the impact of lower loan rates on bank profit margins.\n\nA pivotal moment for China’s economy\n\nThe recent rate cuts mark another step in China’s effort to navigate a challenging economic landscape. As the property market faces headwinds and consumer sentiment remains fragile, the government hopes these measures will reinvigorate borrowing and spending.\n\nWhile the PBOC’s actions aim to maintain stability in financial markets, economists caution that their effectiveness will depend on consumer and investor confidence.\n\nWith additional policy tools at its disposal, the central bank may have to balance further easing with long-term financial stability.\n\nThe post China cuts lending rates to revive economy and stabilize housing market appeared first on Invezz"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

According to the latest financial report, the personal care products manufacturer posted a stellar performance for the just-ended fiscal quarter, with revenue and profit both exceeding market expectations. As of the closing bell on November 10th, the stock of Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care was trading at 40.89 Chinese Yuan (CNH), up by approximately 1% from its previous close. This marks a significant improvement over the past year, with the stock having gained around 17% since its 52-week low of 31.39 CNH recorded on August 25th, 2024. Looking back further, the company's share price has been trending upwards steadily since May 14th, 2024, when it reached its 52-week high of 47.95 CNH. This sustained growth can be attributed to the company's consistent delivery of strong financial performances, which have impressed investors and analysts alike. From a technical standpoint, Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care's current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.98 and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.99 suggest that the stock remains undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at 61.85, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, providing an attractive entry point for potential buyers. Overall, Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care's solid quarterly results and improving fundamentals make a compelling case for long-term investment in the company. However, as with any investment decision, it is essential to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any moves.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Wuxi Paike New Materials (605123.SS) traded down -0.7 % and now trades at CNY 60.58. Current market capitalisation for Wuxi Paike New Materials is CNY 7.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Wuxi Paike New Materials is 21.36. Title: Wuxi Paike New Materials: Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals Investors looking for a profitable investment opportunity may want to consider Wuxi Paike New Materials Technology Co Ltd (WPNM), a Chinese company that specializes in the development and manufacturing of new materials. Despite lacking recent news, a technical analysis of the asset reveals mixed signals that could be of interest to savvy traders. Current Price and Past Performance As of November 6th, 2024, the last closing price of WPNM was 56.87 CNY. This marks a slight increase compared to the previous day's close, but still remains below the 52-week high of 99.47 CNY reached on November 22nd, 2023. On the other hand, the stock has experienced significant volatility over the past year, with a 52-week low of 43.2 CNY on August 26th, 2024. Price Ratios and Earnings WPNM's price to earnings ratio currently stands at 21.36, indicating that the market values each yuan of earnings at approximately 21.36 yuan. Meanwhile, the price to book ratio is 1.53892, suggesting that the market is willing to pay roughly 1.5 times the value of the company's assets. These ratios suggest that investors have some optimism regarding the company's future growth prospects. Technical Indicators Looking at technical indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 53.67, which indicates that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal line is negative, indicating that the short-term momentum is bearish. Additionally, the stock's Bollinger Bands are contracting, which can indicate increased volatility in the near term. Conclusion While Wuxi Paike New Materials has shown promising performance in the past, the current mixed signals in the technical analysis suggest caution for potential investors. The stock's price movement has been relatively stable over the past few months, but the bearish MACD signal and increasing volatility may indicate a possible correction in the near future. Therefore, investors should carefully evaluate their risk tolerance before making any investment decisions regarding WPNM.\n\n- Henan Liliang Diamond (301071.SZ) traded down -0.4 % and now trades at CNY 28.63.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike\nDolan\nWall Street looks set to grind out another record on Tuesday as\nworld markets were enlivened by long-awaited monetary easing in\nChina - rate cuts aimed at underpinning a wobbling economy\nthat's sowing weakness across the world, not least in Europe.\n    Chinese stock indexes <.CSI300> <.HSI> surged more than 4%\non Tuesday and the offshore yuan <CNH=> hit its strongest level\nagainst the dollar in 16 months after a series of moves by the\nPeople's Bank of China to loosen lending conditions.\n    Less than a week after the Federal Reserve's outsize half\npoint rate cut, PBOC boss Pan Gongsheng said banks' reserve\nrequirement ratio would be cut by 50 basis points, freeing up\nabout 1 trillion yuan ($142.21 billion) for new lending. \n    Aimed at shoring up the ongoing property bust and dousing\nfears of wider deflation, the RRR cut came in tandem with a\n20bps cut in the one-week reverse repo rate to 1.5% as well as a\nseries of other key lending and mortgage rate cuts. \n    The sweeping, if long delayed, measures included cutting\nminimum down-payment rates on new homes and capital market props\nand swaps making it easier for funds and brokers to buy stocks.\n    Whether the moves hit home remains to be seen. Geopolitical\nheadwinds, for one, continue to stiffen as the U.S. Commerce\nDepartment on Monday proposed prohibiting key Chinese software\nand hardware in connected vehicles on American roads due to\nnational security concerns.\n    China's slowdown - which this month seen many banks and\ninvestment funds slash growth outlooks to well below Beijing's\n5% target- has infected the industrial world at large. \n    Nowhere is that clearer than in Europe's alarming business\ncontraction in September, according to flash business surveys\npublished on Monday. And at the heart of that is waning German\nconfidence, where Ifo's September survey of German firms on\nTuesday missed forecasts yet again.\n    German business morale fell more than expected for a fourth\nconsecutive month, the survey of around 9,000 managers found.\n    China's latest stimulus, however, proved a shot in the arm\nfor European stocks <.STOXXE> - which gained almost 1%, led by\nsurges in basic resource <.SXPP> and luxury goods <.STXLUXP>\nsectors. \n    The euro <EUR=> recouped a large chunk of Monday's retreat.\n    Although the chance of a European Central Bank cut as soon\nas October crept higher on Monday, it remains less than 50%.\n    Back on Wall Street, Monday's September business surveys\nalso showed ongoing struggles in the factory sector - but,\nunlike in Europe, brisk service sector activity continued to\nshow a healthy overall expansion of the private sector.\n    That has retained faith in the soft landing theme, with the\nS&P500 <.SPX> eking out another record high on Monday and\nfutures are up smartly again ahead of the bell.\n    With some 75bps of additional Fed easing this year now\npriced into rate futures and Fed officials sounding dovish,\ntwo-year Treasury yields <US2YT=RR> hovered about 3.60% on\nTuesday ahead of a $69 billion auction later in the day. The\ntwo-to-10 year yield curve <US2US10=RR> continued to steepen to\na new two-year high of 18bps. \n    Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said on Monday that he\nexpects \"many more rate cuts over the next year\".\n    September U.S. consumer confidence readings are next up for\nexamination later in the day.\n    Elsewhere, Japanese markets returned from Monday's holiday\nin fine fettle, with the Nikkei <.N225> up 0.6% and the yen\n<JPY=> slipping to its lowest in almost three weeks.\n    Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda told business leaders the\ncentral bank will raise interest rates if trend inflation\naccelerates as projected - but appeared unrushed and claimed the\nBOJ can \"afford to spend time\" scrutinising services prices,\nfinancial markets and overseas developments.\n    The Reserve Bank of Australia, meantime, continued to toe a\nrelatively hard line and held its policy rate steady on Tuesday\n- though at least governor Michele Bullock said further\ntightening was not up for discussion.\n    The Australian dollar <AUD=> hit a nine-month high of\n$0.6869 on the decision but later retreated on Bullock's\ncomment.\n    \nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S.\nmarkets later on Tuesday:\n* U.S. September consumer confidence, Richmond Fed September\nbusiness survey, July house prices, \n* Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman speaks; Bank of\nCanada Governor Tiff Macklem speaks; Dutch central bank chief\nand European Central Bank policymaker Klaas Knot speaks \n* US corporate earnings: Micron Technology, Autozone  \n* US Treasury sells $69 billion of 2-year notes\n* United Nations General Assembly in New York\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nChina unveils broad stimulus measures    https://reut.rs/3ZDdlUm\nUS business expands in Sept, but split between services and\nailing factories    https://reut.rs/4dmQdMZ\nU.S. factory hiring boom has fizzled    https://reut.rs/3TD5Zwi\nAustralia's central bank holds the line    https://reut.rs/4eaX0uw\nQualcomm's market value    https://tmsnrt.rs/3MVKUJH\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (By Mike Dolan, editing by Ed Osmond\nmike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)\n ((mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com  https://reut.rs/3xFdLhlhomsonreuters.com\n mailto:mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com; +44 207 542 8488; Reuters\nMessaging: rm://mike.dolan.reuters.com@thomsonreuters.net/))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

However, once Trump’s victory\nwas confirmed and a brief post-election surge in U.S. dollar strength soon\nfaded, markets quickly recalibrated, assuming limited immediate risk given the\ntransition period before January. \n    But as Trump's policies began to sink in - particularly on trade, inflation,\ncentral bank expectations and geopolitical tensions surrounding Ukraine and\nIsrael - the market's outlook shifted. The U.S. dollar continued to rally,\nparticularly against the euro, where the impact of U.S. tariffs could exacerbate\nalready fragile growth. As a result, EUR/USD broke through long-term lows,\ntriggering a resurgence in FX option demand and driving implied volatility\npremiums to new highs.\n    Similar trends are emerging in other currency pairs. While not yet as\npronounced as in EUR/USD, rising demand for options and implied volatility,\nparticularly for expiries extending through 2025, signals that FX volatility\ncould intensify in the months ahead.\n    \n    \n        For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n1-month expiry FXO implied volatility    https://tmsnrt.rs/3Z05D4S\n3-month expiry FXO implied volatility    https://tmsnrt.rs/3ATZ0ZK\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Dollar is Softer Ahead of the Employment ReportMay 03, 2024\n\nOverview:The greenback is trading with a softer bias ahead of the US jobs report. Solid, even if not spectacular job growth, is expected. However, recent survey data warns of the downside risks. Moreover, counter-intuitively, the dollar has not often rallied this year into the employment data, but frequently has in response. The dollar is softer against the G10 currencies. The Norwegian krone is the strongest, up about 0.6% after the central bank delivered a hawkish hold, by warning that rates may need to stay restrictive longer than it has previously anticipated. Also, of note, the greenback made a new low for the week against the yen near JPY152.75, which is also a new three-week low. Emerging market currencies, but the Czech koruna and South African rand are also firm against the dollar today, and the offshore yuan firmed to its best level since mid-March.\n\nAsia Pacific equities are mixed, but the highlight is the ninth consecutive rally in the Hang Seng, and over the run it is up almost 14%. The mainland shares that trade in HK have risen in eight of the past nine sessions and has also risen nearly 14%. Europe's Stoxx 600 is rising for the first time since Monday, and it needs some follow-through gains to negate this week's decline after rallying 1.75% last week. Encouraged by some corporate earnings, US index futures are extended this week's gains, but the US jobs report is key. Benchmark 10-year yields are slightly softer in Europe and are little changed on the week. The 10-year US Treasury yield is near 4.57%, off about four basis points this week. Gold is consolidating quietly, straddling $2300. It looks to be the first back-to-back loss since February. June WTI is consolidating after falling about 6% in the past four sessions. It reached nearly $78.40 yesterday, its lowest level since March 13. It has fallen by about 5.8% so far this week, which is the largest decline in three months.\n\nAsia Pacific\n\nChinese and Japanese markets are closed for national holidays today.Next week, Japanese highlights include March labor earnings and household spending. Cash earnings continue to lag inflation but using the same sample base, cash earnings are faring slightly better. The weakness in March retail sales (-1.2% vs. median forecast in Bloomberg's survey of a 0.2% decline) warns of continued weakness in household spending. On a year-over-year basis, Japanese household spending last increased in February 2022. The Japanese economy appears to have contracted slightly in the first quarter. Note that Japanese markets are closed on Monday. In this week's rounds of intervention, Japanese officials took advantage of thin market conditions to boost the impact of its operations. The prospect of another bout of intervention may keep many participants cautious.\n\nChina's Caixin service and composite PMI will be reported early Monday.China is due to report its foreign reserves. The decline in the other reserve currencies in April (-4.1% JPY, -1.2% Euro, and -1.0% GBP) suggests a decline in the dollar value of China's reserves from $3.245 trillion in March, which was the highest since the end of 2021. Lending and trade figures are also due. The April price gauges will be reported next Saturday, May 11. Beijing recently announced that the third plenum (third since the 2022 when the current central committee was selected. Many expected the third plenum would be held last October-November but it was not. It is typically devoted to economic issues. The main topic, according to the state press, will be \"deepening reforms and promoting modernization.\"\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia meets on May 8.At the end of last year, the futures market was pricing in almost two rate cuts this year. The market has not been fully discounting even one cut since around mid-March. However, since the slightly firmer than expected Q1 CPI on April 24, the market has priced in a risk of a hike this year (slightly less than a 25% chance). The Reserve Bank of New Zealand meets on May 22. The swaps market shows little chance of a change in stance, but it still is discounting a cut this year and it is fully discounted at the last meeting of the year (November). The pricing in the swaps market is consistent with a quarter-point cut and a 40% chance of a second one.\n\nThe dollar swung from a post-Thursday intervention high near JPY156.30 to nearly JPY153 in the North American afternoon yesterday.It was sold to about JPY152.75 in the thin Asia Pacific session today. The JPY152.55 area corresponds to the (38.2%) retracement target of this year's dollar rally. The halfway mark is around JPY150.20. Although implied volatility has fallen this week, historic or actual volatility has risen. One-month historic vol is above 12% from 7.6% at the end of last week when the spike to JPY158.45 spooked officials. It was around 4.7% the previous day (April 25). The Australian dollar extended Wednesday's recovery to reach almost $0.6575 yesterday and is testing the week's high set on Monday near $0.6585.Nearby resistance is in the $0.6600-$0.6625 area. Note that there are options for A$1.2 bln at $0.6625 that expire Monday. Initial support is seen around $0.6650.The US dollar plunged to CNH7.1950 yesterday, its lowest level since the Ides of March.Follow-through selling today has seen nearly CNH7.1855 before steadying. The dollar has fallen by a little more than 1% against the offshore yuan this week, ahead of the US jobs report. If sustained, it would be the largest weekly loss since last November. Assuming that the onshore yuan will open sharply higher on Monday, it underscores our sense that the weakness of the yuan was more a reflection of the US dollar's broad strength rather than Beijing seeking export advantage through the exchange rate.\n\nEurope\n\nThe eurozone March unemployment was steady at 6.5%.It was between 6.5% and 6.6% last year. Eurozone unemployment has not been lower under monetary union. US unemployment is also low, but the economy has been strong (above trend growth). The eurozone economy has been week and contracted in the second half of last year. Next week, the EC updates its economic forecasts. Its last forecast was for 0.8% growth this year and 2.7% CPI. The ECB's March forecast saw growth at 0.6% and CPI at 2.3% this year. Lastly, the eurozone will also see March retail sales. With Q1 GDP already reported, March retail sales report is not a market mover. However, the recovery in German retail sales (1.8% vs. -1.5% in February). French retail sales saw the first year-over-year gain since May 2022. Spanish retail sales disappointed falling by 0.5%. Italy does not report March retail sales until after the aggregate figure is out, but household consumption looks to have been a drag on Q1 GDP.\n\nThe UK reported the final services and composite PMI today.Recall that on Wednesday, the final manufacturing PMI was reported. It was revised to 49.1 from 48.7 but did not appear to have much market impact. The services PMI was revised to 55.0 from 54.9 (53.1 in February). The composite PMI edged up to 54.1 from 54.0 flash reading and 52.8 in February. It was at 52.1 at the end of 2023 and 54.9 last April. There are two highlights next week, the Bank of England meeting on May 9. The swaps market has the first cut priced in for September (though there is nearly an 80% chance of a cut in August). The market has one cut and about a 60% chance of a second cut discounted before the end of the year. Separately, the results of yesterday's elections are still being tallied. The results will be released today and tomorrow. The initial results seem to be in line with polls showing Tories losing broadly with Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens, and independents doing better. Still, it does not seem like much of a market factor today.\n\nThe euro reached $1.0730 in the North American afternoon yesterday.Every day so far this week, the euro has been capped at $1.0730-35 but today it has reached almost $1.0750. Last Friday, it approached $1.0755. The $1.0745 area is the (50%) retracement of the euro's decline from the high set last month (~$1.0885). The (61.8%) retracement is near $1.0775 and the 200-day moving average is around $1.08.Sterling has chopped between about $1.2465 and $1.2570 this week.It remains in that range today, though approaching the high. The $1.2555 area corresponds to the (61.8%) retracement of sterling's losses from last month's high (~$1.2710). The downtrend line from the March and April highs comes in today near $1.2575. The intraday momentum indicators of both currencies are extended in the European morning. Lastly, we note that as widely expected, Norway's central bank left its deposit rate unchanged at 4.50%. The swaps market is not pricing in a rate cut until next year. Sweden is a different story, and the Riksbank could become the second G10 central bank to cut rates (after Switzerland) next week.\n\nAmerica\n\nIt is about the US jobs report today.Some survey data warns that the economy may have lost some momentum and warn of the risk of disappointing employment data today. The ADP private sector jobs estimate was slightly better than expected but is not material. Consider that through Q1, ADP estimated that private sector job growth averaged 158k while the BLS said 212k, and average miss of 44k. The median forecast for private sector job growth in Bloomberg's survey average about 168k in Q1. However, last year, the BLS reported private sector job growth averaged 192k a month, while the ADP estimate averaged 208k. California's minimum wage for fast-food workers rose by more than 25% to $20 an hour. Economists expect average hourly earnings rose by 0.3% last month for a 4.0% year-over-year pace, which if true, would be the slowest since June 2021. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.8%. Next week, the calendar turns quieter. The senior loan officer survey and the preliminary University of Michigan survey, alongside the quarterly refunding, are the highlights.\n\nCanada sees the services and composite PMI today.They stood at 46.4 and 47.0 in March, respectively. The reaction to the US employment report will likely overwhelm the Canadian PMI. Next week, Canada reports its April employment data. The market is looking at slightly better jobs creation, but another tick up in the unemployment rate (to 6.2% from 6.1%). Last April it was at 5%. Turning to Mexico, it reports April domestic vehicle sales. Through March, they are up about 4.7% year-over-year. US vehicle sales rose by about 4.5% in the first quarter. Several hours before the central bank makes its rate announcement on May 9, Mexico will report April CPI. The improvement appears to be slowing, and the central bank is widely expected to standpat after cutting rates at its last meeting (March).\n\nThe risk-on mood and the US dollar's broad pullback helped the Canadian dollar recoup the losses seen earlier this week.The unexpected deterioration of Canada's March trade balance (C$2.28 bln deficit compared with the median forecast in Bloomberg's survey for a C$1.2 bln surplus) and the sharp downward revision to the February surplus (~C$0.50 bln vs. C$1.4 bln) did not seem to impact the Canadian dollar. On Tuesday, the greenback surged from about CAD1.3660 to CAD1.3785. It pulled back to CAD1.3700 on Wednesday and CAD1.3670 yesterday. It eased to about CAD1.3655 today. The US dollar saw CAD1.3635 last Friday and almost CAD1.3630 on Monday. A break of CAD1.3620 could spur a leg lower toward CAD1.3550-CAD1.3565. Initial resistance is seen around CAD1.3720.The US dollar fell to a new two-week low against the Mexican peso yesterday (~MXN16.9020).But again, the greenback was bought and recovered back above MXN17.00 in late dealings, though settled near MXN16.9850. A break of MXN16.88-MXN16.90 may bolster sentiment. Other Latam currencies performed considerably better. The Brazilian real' nearly 1.6% rally led emerging market (and G10) currencies. The Chilean peso was a close second, rising 1.5%. The Peruvian sol's nearly 1% gain rounds out the top three currencies against the greenback yesterday.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Daily Market Outlook - Wednesday, Nov. 6Nov 06, 2024\n\nImage Source: Pixabay  \n\nThe results of the US presidential election indicate that Trump will emerge victorious and the Republican Party will maintain control of the Senate. The New York Times' closely-watched 'swingometer' projected a 93% chance of Trump winning, while Treasury yields rose to four-month highs as some betting sites significantly favoured him. However, the House of Representatives is still too close to call. Four years after departing the White House, Trump has advanced to the brink of a remarkable political revival by defeating Democrat Kamala Harris in the battleground states of North Carolina, Georgia & Pennsylvania. The euro, yen, and antipodean currencies have experienced declines as a result of the 1.5% increase in the US dollar index, which is the largest increase since March 2020. The dollar's sharp increase against the offshore yuan prompted reports that Chinese banks were selling dollars to slow the yuan's decline. China is perceived as being at the forefront of tariff risk, and its currency is currently trading at a high level of uncertainty, with implied volatility against the dollar circling record highs. As investors anticipate a meeting of top policymakers in Beijing this week to sanction local government debt refinancing and spending, Chinese markets have declined from an almost one-month high.\n\nEuropean stock futures were less ebullient due to the potential for a global trade war and the threat to EU exports if Trump's tariff policies are implemented. Additionally, there was a possibility that Trump could disengage from NATO, which would necessitate an increase in defence expenditures in Europe and would also serve to strengthen Russia's territorial ambitions. Aside from US political developments, macro events that could potentially impact markets on Wednesday include: Services within the Eurozone Producer prices for September and PMIs for October. September industrial orders in Germany. Services provided by the United States PMI for October.  \n\nOvernight Newswire Updates of Note\n\n * Trump Wins The Critical Battleground State Of Pennsylvania \n * PBoC Affirms Supportive Monetary Policy\n * Japan PM Ishiba Preps Meeting With Biden, China’s XI\n * Japan PMI, Confidence Shrinks On Softer Sales\n * UBS Pushes Back RBA First Rate Cut Forecast To May 2025\n * NZ Unemployment Rate Rises Less Than Forecast\n * Hong Kong Stocks Slide, Traders Pare Risky Bets\n * US Stock, Yields Rise As Markets Await Election Outcome\n * Nvidia Rides AI Wave Past Apple As World largest Company\n * Crypto Surge To Record Levels On Early Trump Lead\n * Spike In UK Borrowing Cost Wipes Out Fiscal Headroom\n *           (Sourced from reliable financial news outlets)\n\n \n\nFX Options Expiries For 10am New York Cut \n\n(1BLN+ represents larger expiries, more magnetic when trading within daily ATR)\n\n * EUR/USD: 1.0650 (3.9BLN), 1.0700 (686M), 1.0725 (1.5BLN)\n * 1.0750 (900M) 1.0800 (2.4BLN)\n * USD/CHF: 0.8675 (241M), 0.8700 (1.4BLN), 0.8800 (289M)\n * EUR/GBP: 0.8390-0.8400 (621M)\n * GBP/USD: 1.3000 (331M)\n * AUD/USD: 0.6475 (689M), 0.6510 (728M), 0.6525 (817M)\n * AUD/NZD: 1.1010 (397M), 1.1100 (300M)\n * USD/CAD: 1.3800 (555M), 1.3875 (420M), 1.4025 (267M), 1.4050 (442M)\n * USD/JPY: 153.50 (728M), 155.65 (350M)  \n\nCFTC Data As Of 1/11/24\n\n * Net USD G10 long +$8.88bn to +$18.7bn in Oct 23-29 IMM period; $IDX +0.13%\n * EUR +0.17%: speculative positions decreased by 21.8k contracts, now at -50.3k, lower ECB view weighs on EUR\n * JPY +1.55%; speculative positions decreased by 37.6k contracts, now at +25k, on hawkish Fed, less dovish BoJ\n * GBP +0.27%; speculative positions decreased by 8.2k contracts, now at +66.4k; less-dovish BoE lends support.

SWIFT is a global provider of financial messaging services. \n\n China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is the largest market for offshore yuan transactions, taking up 76.18 percent, followed by the UK at 6.16 percent and Singapore at 3.76 percent, the report said. \n\n The data shows that the yuan is becoming increasingly popular as more countries are willing to use the Chinese currency in cross-border trade settlement, conduct cross-border investment and financing, and sign currency swap deals with China, Xi Junyang, a professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Thursday. \n\n With solid efforts to promote yuan's internationalization in recent years, China has seen a strengthened role of the yuan across the board, from international payment and settlement, investment and financing, and reserves to pricing. \n\n As of the end of August, the People's Bank of China (PBC), the country's central bank, signed bilateral currency swap agreements with 42 foreign central banks or monetary authorities. A total of 29 bilateral currency swap agreements are in force, with a total scale of about 4.1 trillion yuan ($561.72 billion), the Xinhua News Agency reported, citing a PBC report. \n\n The PBC stressed at a meeting on Monday that the central bank will steadily boost financial reform and high-level opening-up next. It said efforts will be made to promote the internationalization of the yuan in a careful and robust manner, further enhance its functions as an international currency for cross-border payments, investment and financing, reserves and other functions. Meanwhile, the central bank will strengthen the competitiveness of the yuan cross-border payment system. \n\n The internationalization of the yuan is an important part of China's financial opening-up. Looking ahead, efforts are needed in several aspects to boost the yuan's internationalization, Xi said. He said the country should continue to expand opening-up, strengthen connect programs with other markets, and facilitate convenience in cross-border investment and fund-raising. \n\n As an increasingly international currency, the yuan is able to maintain a stable exchange rate in the future thanks to multiple favorable factors, including the central government's supportive macroeconomic policies that have improved market expectations, sustained economic recovery and foreign exchange market resilience. \n\n\nCopyright Global Times.

Unlike other FX majors the\nCNH and CNY are in the spotlight on concerns that a victory for Trump would\nrefocus policy on protectionism and tariffs. Trump has suggested 20% tariffs\non all US imports and 60% for China goods and more recently we had news of\nTrump promising up to 100% tariffs on Mexican goods.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe charts above highlight the extent of surge in overnight implied vols\n(mids) with CNH trading close to 30% while MXN is trading through 100%.

Meanwhile, China's central bank injected CN¥568.2 billion ($80.11 billion) through seven-day reverse repos on Wednesday to offset maturing MLF loans and reverse repos, ensuring ample liquidity in the banking system.

Earlier this week, official data showed that the country’s economy expanded 5.3% in the first quarter from a year ago, higher than the 5.2% seen in the previous quarter and beating expectations for a 5% growth. Analysts said that strong first quarter growth will likely prevent authorities from easing policy further, which should provide some support to the yuan. However, industrial production and retail sales in China rose less than anticipated in March. Externally, the yuan faced downward pressure from a rallying dollar as strong US economic data and hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve officials cemented expectations that the Fed will delay interest rate cuts."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

One possible reason behind this rally could be investors' renewed confidence in the company's ability to navigate the challenging shipping industry.

The relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at 64.7, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Meanwhile, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) signal line is above the MACD signal line, suggesting that bullish momentum is building. In conclusion, despite the arbitration proceedings, Yangzijiang Shipbuilding's share price has remained resilient due to its strong fundamentals and improving industry conditions.

He said the gold trading corridor - which could settle in offshore\nyuan - would enhance Hong Kong's status as a gold product center and he\nsuggested a daily liquidity quota of 50 billion yuan (HK$54.4 billion).\n\nMeanwhile, Cheung urged the Hong Kong government to launch digital gold - a\nproduct that combines physical gold with digital technology - to catch up with\nrival hub Singapore.\n\nAlso, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui\nChing-yu said Hong Kong's economy is regaining momentum.\n\nHui added that the city has always been able to utilize its financial\nstrengths to serve different regions and markets under different economic\ncycles\n\nElsewhere, bitcoin, which earned the moniker \"digital gold\" to some investors,\nsurged through US$51,000 yesterday, exceeding its US$1 trillion market\ncapitalization.\n\ncaroline.zheng@singtaonewscorp.com"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

Domestically focused small-cap\nstocks have jumped on expectations for less competition from\ntariffs and lower tax rates, with the Russell 2000 <.RUT>\nvaulting to a three-year high on Monday.   \n    Bitcoin, the world's biggest cryptocurrency, has shot up \nabout 30% since the Nov. 5 election, rocketing toward the\n$90,000 mark. Trump is seen as a proponent of cryptocurrencies,\npromising during his campaign to make the United States the\n\"crypto capital of the planet.\" \n    U.S. stocks have rallied since the election, with each of\nWall Street's three major indexes closing at record levels on\nMonday. \n    But concerns that Trump's policies could rekindle inflation\nafter a long battle to reduce price pressures following the\nCOVID-19 pandemic have pushed U.S. Treasury yields and the\ndollar higher. Markets will get the latest inflation reading on\nWednesday in the consumer price index (CPI) for October. \n    \"The 10-year Treasury yield is kind of creating a headwind\nagainst the equity rally,\" said Jack Ablin, chief investment\nofficer at Cresset Capital in Chicago. \"There's sort of these\nconflicting signals where investors are celebrating all of these\ngrowth initiatives but the bond market is pushing back.\"\n    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 250.15 points,\nor 0.56%, to 44,042.98, the S&P 500 <.SPX> fell 5.53 points, or\n0.09%, to 5,995.82, and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> rose 0.02\npoints, or 0.00%, to 19,298.79. \n    Shares of Home Depot <HD.N> shed 0.1%, giving up earlier\ngains, after the home improvement retailer reported quarterly\nresults. \n    In Europe, shares closed lower, weighed down by names with a\nlarge exposure to China, with news that Trump was expected to\nselect U.S. Senator Marco Rubio as his secretary of state. Rubio\nis seen as the most hawkish option on Trump's list of\ncandidates.\n    MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS> \nfell 5.26 points, or 0.61%, to 857.84. The STOXX 600 <.STOXX>\nindex lost 1.98%, while Europe's broad FTSE EuroFirst 300 index\n<.FTEU3> closed down 40.36 points, or 1.99%, as both suffered \ntheir biggest daily percentage drops since early August.  \n    The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> rose\n12.2 basis points to 4.43%, from 4.308% late on Friday; the bond\nmarket was closed on Monday for a federal holiday.\n    Aside from the CPI data, several Federal Reserve officials\nare speaking this week following the central bank's policy\ndecision last week to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. \n    Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said that with\ninflation close to the Federal Reserve's 2% target, the labor\nmarket resilient and the U.S. central bank in the process of\nlowering borrowing costs, policymakers are ready to respond if\ninflation pressures rise or the job market weakens. \n    Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari\nsaid the economy is \"in a good place\" and he feels U.S. monetary\npolicy is currently \"modestly restrictive,\" with short-term\nborrowing costs continuing to slow inflation and the economy,\nbut not by a lot.\n    The dollar index <=USD>, which measures the greenback\nagainst a basket of currencies, rose 0.54% to 105.99, with the\neuro <EUR=> down 0.36% at $1.0616. The greenback has risen in\nfour of five sessions since the election to reach 106.17, its\nhighest level since May 1. \n    Against the Japanese yen <JPY=>, the dollar strengthened\n0.66% to 154.72. Sterling <GBP=> fell 1.01% to $1.2739.\n    The dollar <CNH=> strengthened 0.22% to 7.243 versus the\noffshore Chinese yuan.\n    The greenback is expected to continue to strengthen against\nChina's currency and those sensitive to its economy as a result\nof Trump's trade policies and because of expectations of higher\nU.S. Treasury yields.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Extinction of autonomous bodies, on standbyThe administrative reform which is part of Andrés Manuel López Obrador's Plan C and which intends to eliminate seven autonomous bodies is on a sort of stand by.\n\nDespite the fact that this reform was approved by the Constitutional Points Commission of the Chamber of Deputies on August 28, it is not on the legislative agenda in the few days remaining before the end of López Obrador's government and in which the initiative for the National Guard to be officially integrated into the Ministry of Defense will be approved in fast track and with the steamroller of Morena and allied parties.\n\nIt seems that it was President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum who managed to stop this administrative reform to give priority to the judicial reform, but the doubt is whether it will only be a postponement and will be dealt with in this same ordinary period or in the next, or if the disappearance of the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) will really be reversed, the Federal Economic Competition Commission (Cofece), the National Institute for Transparency, Access to Information and Protection of Personal Data (Inai), the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE), the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH), the National Commission for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (Coneval) and the National Commission for the Continuous Improvement of Education (Mejoredu).\n\nINCREASED UNCERTAINTY AND TRADE DISPUTES\n\nWhat is least convenient for Sheinbaum is to generate greater uncertainty among investors with the disappearance of autonomous bodies at the beginning of her administration.\n\nIn the case of the IFT and Cofece they would give rise to controversies in the framework of the T-MEC when one of Sheinbaum's priorities in 2025 will be the revision of the treaty; while the disappearance of the Inai would be a serious setback in terms of transparency and governance and it is an absurdity that the government becomes judge and party before the demands for information on the government's business at all levels of government.\n\nAnd in the case of Coneval, the allies of the 4T should be the first to be interested in the continuation of an independent body that evaluates the application and efficiency of social programs, because what is measured can be improved.\n\nAs for the CRE and the CNH, since the beginning of the six-year term, they lost their independence and became de facto subordinated to the Sener. It should be remembered that since the morning, López Obrador made life impossible for Guillermo García Alcocer to force him to resign as president of the CRE.\n\nFED TO LOWER RATES TODAY\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank will hold its monetary policy meeting today, and the doubt among analysts is whether it will lower rates by 25 or 50 basis points.\n\nAnalysts' bet that rates will be lowered is the reason why markets remain optimistic in the United States and why the dollar has depreciated against the main international currencies, including the peso. Yesterday, the interbank dollar closed at 19.12 pesos compared to the 20.08 pesos it traded at last week before the approval of the judicial reform.\n\nIn the case of Mexico, the decision of the monetary policy meeting of Banxico's Board of Governors will be announced on Thursday, September 26, and it is expected that -regardless of the Fed's decision- the majority will opt to lower rates by 25 basis points."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

One Xi'an Sinofuse Electric stock can currently be bought for about CNY 96.66 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Xi'an Sinofuse Electric stocks is 62.9 mn. Xi'an Sinofuse Electric has a current market capitalization of CNY 5.1 bn and approximately CNY 49.4 mn worth of Xi'an Sinofuse Electric was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Xi'an Sinofuse Electric has traded 17.32 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 94.01. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 158 on 11/29/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 65.01 on 08/27/2024.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion (603583.SS) traded up 4.85 % and now trades at CNY 19.1. Current market capitalisation for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is CNY 6.7 bn. Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion has a current price to earnings ratio of 18.89. Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Zhejiang Chengchang (Zhejiang Chengchang) traded flat 0 % and now trades at CNY 35.56.

Title: Technical Analysis: Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made Co Ltd (NDEM) may be scratching their heads after reviewing the company's latest financial data. While there have been no recent news updates on the company, a closer look at the numbers reveals some interesting trends. Firstly, let's take a glance at the stock's price movement over the past year. As of September 17th, 2024, the closing price of NDEM stands at 15.85 CNH, which represents a significant drop from its 52-week high of 25.77 CNH recorded on November 19th, 2023. However, this decline has not deterred investors entirely, as the stock still maintains a respectable 52-week low of 13.31 CNH on February 5th, 2024. When examining the company's valuation ratios, we see that the Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 16.79, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 16 times the company's earnings per share. Meanwhile, the Price to Book (P/B) ratio sits at 2.14, suggesting that the market values each dollar of NDEM's book value at around 2.14 dollars. While these ratios might seem attractive to potential investors, they do not tell the whole story. The lack of recent news updates could indicate either a stable or struggling company, depending on one's perspective. Moreover, the mixed signals from the stock's price movements and valuation ratios suggest that investors should exercise caution before making any investment decisions. In conclusion, while Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made Co Ltd presents an intriguing opportunity for investors, further research and analysis are necessary to fully understand the company's current situation and future prospects. As such, investors are advised to keep a watchful eye on upcoming developments and news updates before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Tuya (2391.HK) traded up 2.14 % and now trades at HKD 13.46.

Current Price and Past Performance As of September 29th, 2024, Tuya's last closing price was 13.38 Hong Kong Dollars (HKD). This marks a significant decrease from its 52-week high of 17.1 HKD on January 15th, 2024, but still represents a modest gain compared to its 52-week low of 11.24 HKD on October 16th, 2023. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio With a price-to-earnings ratio of -56.01, investors may be hesitant to jump into Tuya stock, given the negative value indicates that the market is pricing in significant losses for the company. However, the price-to-book ratio of 0.727914 suggests that the company's assets are undervalued relative to its share price. Technical Indicators Looking at short-term moving averages, the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) is currently sitting at 14.22 HKD, while the 50-day SMA is at 15.47 HKD. These indicators suggest that the stock could experience a bounce back towards these levels based on historical patterns. Longer-term investors may want to keep an eye on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which stands at 44.84 as of this writing. If the RSI breaks above 50, it could signal a potential uptrend for Tuya's shares. Conclusion Although there have been no recent news updates from Tuya Smart, a Technical Analysis of its assets reveals some promising signs for long-term investors. With a strong history of innovation and a solid track record of growth, Tuya remains an attractive option for those looking to capitalize on the burgeoning smart home industry. As always, however, it's essential to conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Pengxin Mining (600490.SS) traded up 9.85 % and now trades at CNY 3.27.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Amid Tech War Trumbles, Pre-CPI Jitters Ripple Across Trading FloorsDec 09, 2024\n\nImage Source: Unsplash\n\nMARKETS\n\nMonday's US stock market session saw a mild retreat, spotlighted by Nvidia’s (NVDA) slip, a dip tied to a burgeoning antitrust probe in China. This pullback sets the stage for a potential macro pivotal week on Wall Street, as all eyes turn to the upcoming consumer inflation report—a key precursor to the Federal Reserve's year-end rate decision. As we edge closer to Wednesday's CPI data release, the air is still thick with anticipation of a potential quarter-point rate cut on December 18, especially after Friday’s job report showed subtle signs of labour market cooling beneath the surface number.\n\nAs caution sweeps across the trading floors, investors meticulously trim positions in stocks and bonds, bracing for the pivotal economic updates ahead. This air of caution is palpable, reflecting a strategic response to potential shifts emerging from the impending inflation report that could impact future Federal Reserve decisions.\n\nNvidia's shares took a 3% hit as Chinese regulators launched an antitrust investigation into the tech giant, positioning it at the epicentre of the intensifying US-China technology dispute. This scrutiny could escalate tensions further, transforming the ongoing trade war over goods and services into a high-stakes Tech War confrontation reminiscent of a complex game of Axis and Allies.\n\nMeanwhile, US-listed Chinese stocks rallied as Beijing signalled robust monetary easing, it's first in over a decade, promising aggressive stimulus measures aimed at stabilizing its property and stock markets through \"extraordinary counter-cyclical policy adjustments.\" This bold fiscal maneuvering showcases China’s determination to counteract the economic turbulence anticipated from Trump’s tariff threats, setting a trajectory for a potential return to + 5% GDP boost.\n\nThe offshore Yuan displayed resilience, trading at just under 7.27, as Beijing’s proactive fiscal strategies sought to cushion the economy against external trade pressures. This should enhance the outlook for ASEAN currencies this morning.\n\nWe find ourselves cycling through the familiar Politburo playbook of stimulus measures—perhaps a testament to Xi’s enduring strategy to refine China’s economic engine. Yet, this holiday season sees a synchronized easing across the globe as major central banks, including the Fed, ECB, SNB, and BoC, align their policies towards further relaxation, introducing a calm under the surface yet complex dynamic into the financial markets.\n\nDespite geopolitical tremors, from South Korea’s political unrest to the dramatic downfall of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, global markets have navigated through numerous storms this year with remarkable resilience, and the impact of these unexpected events will pass, too. While Assad's fall has sent ripples through the Middle East, it has yet to stir significant disruptions in global capital markets. Even as gold sees modest gains, the overarching sentiment is driven by optimism for China’s economic prospects and prevailing US exceptionalism, overshadowing regional instabilities.\n\nASIA MARKETS\n\nMonday's downturn on Wall Street might ripple across Asia, yet investors are keenly watching as China pivots on policy for the first time since 2010. The Politburo's fresh stance, advocating for a \"more proactive\" fiscal policy and a \"moderately loose\" monetary approach, may not echo Mario Draghi's dramatic 2012 \"whatever it takes\" promise, but it signals a potentially transformative move for China as it wrestles with a property downturn, deflation, and sluggish growth.\n\nChina optimists are buzzing, pointing to the flood of fiscal and liquidity measures rolled out this year as proof of Beijing's unwavering resolve to turbocharge its economy. They argue that with such a marked policy shift, now is the prime time to dive into Chinese equities.\n\nOn the flip side, the skeptics urge caution, arguing that Beijing's history of big promises and limited action calls for a restrained approach. They warn that any meaningful economic recovery hinges on the government's readiness to tackle the banking sector's mounting bad loans and consider a full-scale bank bailout—without such decisive actions, they doubt significant progress is feasible.\n\nThe big snag, however, is the resurgence of Sino-US trade tensions. On Monday, China announced it had initiated an investigation into Nvidia Corp for potential violations of its anti-monopoly laws—widely perceived as retaliation against recent US restrictions on China's chip sector. This development hints at a looming escalation, especially with President-elect Donald Trump poised to take office. Trump's penchant for aggressive tech and trade policies, often unveiled through fiery social media tirades, could shake the foundations of Asia's burgeoning tech boomtowns, especially those thriving in AI and semiconductor industries. This brewing storm threatens to cast long shadows over the region's economic prospects, stirring unease among global investors.\n\nOIL MARKETS\n\nOil prices ticked up overnight, fueled by a cocktail of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and anticipation of China's planned economic stimulus. Although the ongoing conflict in Syria adds a layer of uncertainty, its impact on the broader oil supply from the Middle East is minimal due to Syria's limited role in oil production. The situation could escalate, but such a scenario is unlikely to unfold, especially with Trump poised to retake office. His presence is expected to deter significant regional destabilization, keeping major disruptions in check.\n\nMoreover, the shift in global energy dynamics, spearheaded by China's aggressive adoption of electric vehicles, continues to reshape demand patterns and temper the broader market outlook. This recalibration in demand, coupled with projections of an oil surplus in 2025 fueled by ramped-up U.S. production, has traders treading carefully, weighing the immediate price bumps against a complex future landscape.\n\nSuppose President Xi Jinping delivers on his bold bazooka-type fiscal and monetary stimulus promises. In that case, savvy investors should consider loading up on commodities to capitalize on China's impending domestic boom. Metals and agricultural goods will likely surge, espeically if consumer demand spikes, making them a smart hedge. However, steer clear of oil—China's pivot towards electric vehicles and renewable energy could keep a lid on oil demand even as other markets ignite.\n\nFOREX MARKETS\n\nWhile an anticipated Fed rate cut this month might typically signal trouble for the U.S. dollar, the easing measures by other G10 central banks and the PBoC getting a case of rate fever could counterbalance this effect. Yet, the subdued momentum of the broader U.S. dollar can be primarily attributed to a two-week decline in U.S. Treasury yields. This surprising turn has confounded many post-election forecasts.\n\nAs we round out the year, this widespread monetary loosening may keep currency markets with broader ranges. However, the dollar's enduring strength will hinge significantly on how FX markets decipher the somewhat perplexing U.S. political landscape and navigate the impending change of power in Washington next month.\n\nThe yen took an unexpected dive despite Japan announcing stronger growth for the July-September quarter, driven by significant upward revisions in capital investments and exports. However, the focus quickly shifted to Japan's underwhelming private consumption data, which only increased by 0.7% versus the expected 0.9%. This disappointing figure has fueled speculation that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) might postpone its anticipated rate hike to January or beyond.\n\nAdding complexity, the Korean Won’s notable decline could influence BoJ's strategy. It’s not out of the realm that the BoJ might be strategically delaying any moves until the political dust settles, potentially aiming to keep the yen slightly weaker. This tactic would ensure Japanese exports remain competitively priced against Korean goods in international markets, a subtle maneuver in the intricate dance of currency and trade.\n\nMore By This Author:\n\nAmid Geopolitical Hotbeds, Asia Starts The Week With Cautious Optimism OIL MARKET: Pressure Among OPEC+ Member Mounting?

This decline can be attributed to the ongoing global economic uncertainty and the resulting slowdown in tech spending. * Net Income: Hundsun's net income for the quarter was $23 million, down from $47 million in the same period last year. This represents a significant drop of 51%. However, the company's diluted EPS remained stable at $0.15 per share. * Gross Margin: The company's gross margin for the quarter was 62%, which is slightly lower than the 65% reported during the same period last year. This decrease can be attributed to higher material costs and increased competition in the market. * Operating Expenses: Operating expenses for the quarter were $347 million, up from $323 million in the same period last year. This increase can be attributed to investments made in research and development, sales, and marketing efforts.

This decline comes despite the lack of any recent news or updates from the company.

The stock reached its 52-week high of 22.22 CNY on April 18th, 2024, before falling to a low of 11.78 CNY on August 20th, 2023. However, since then, the stock has been steadily increasing, reaching its current price of 15.78 CNY. Based on this information, it appears that Western Mining may be due for an upswing. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the magnitude of recent price changes to determine overbought or oversold conditions, currently stands at 44.76, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which signals potential buy or sell opportunities by comparing the difference between two moving averages, has recently crossed bullishly, suggesting a possible upward trend. Valuation Ratios Point to Undervalued Opportunity? In terms of valuation ratios, Western Mining's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 12.6335, which is slightly above the industry average. Similarly, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 2.33075 indicates that the stock may be undervalued relative to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to purchase shares at a discounted price. Conclusion While there has been no recent news from Western Mining to explain the recent share price decrease, technical analysis suggests that the stock may be poised for an upswing. Valuation ratios also indicate that the stock may be undervalued relative to its peers, providing an attractive opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the potential growth of the company. As such, investors may want to keep a close eye on Western Mining in the coming days and weeks to see if these trends continue to unfold.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Everdisplay Optronics Shanghai\n\nThe Everdisplay Optronics Shanghai Co Ltd is a Chinese company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

According to data from finanzen.net, WIM's last known news dates back to August 27th, with the stock closing at 10.37 CNH.

Its 52-week high of 17.47 CNH was reached on September 10th, 2023, and its 52-week low of 9.7 CNH occurred on February 5th, 2024.

Baidu has a market capitalisation of HKD 209.4 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Baidu is 10.53. In recent news, investors have been advised to exercise caution when considering purchasing shares of Baidu Inc., a leading Chinese language internet search provider. Two major risks have been identified that may impact the company's performance and potentially lead to a \"value trap\" for investors. Firstly, concerns have been raised about the potential for data leaks and model tampering due to the lack of transparency in Baidu's artificial intelligence (AI) supply chain. This risk has been highlighted by the introduction of a new industry standard aimed at addressing these issues, which was developed under the United Nations framework and includes participation from major tech companies like Ant Financial, Tencent, Baidu, Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Secondly, there are fears that Baidu's stock could be overvalued, potentially making it a value trap for investors. Analysts have noted that the company's current valuation does not accurately reflect its underlying fundamentals, and that any disappointment in future earnings could result in a significant decline in share price. Despite these risks, Baidu remains a key player in China's technology landscape, and its involvement in the development of the new AI supply chain standard demonstrates its commitment to ensuring the integrity of its products and services. As such, investors may still consider Baidu as a viable long-term investment opportunity, but should proceed with caution and carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards before making any decisions.\n\n- Beijing-shanghai High Speed Railway (601816.SS) traded down -0.92 % and now trades at CNH 5.35.

The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 54.76, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, leaving room for further growth. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a bullish crossover, indicating that the short-term moving average has crossed above the long-term moving average, which could be an indication of an upward trend. Valuation Ratios Favorable Compared to Industry Peers When compared to industry peers, BSHSR appears to be undervalued based on its Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.2325 and Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 1.44042. This suggests that investors may be able to purchase shares in the company at a discount relative to its peers, potentially leading to higher returns in the future.

However, the stock has yet to reach its 52-week high of 1.9 EUR, set on December 11th, 2023. A closer look at CITI's technical indicators paints a mixed picture. The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 58.47, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, on the other hand, suggests that the stock may be due for a correction, as the MACD line is below the signal line. In terms of valuation, CITI's Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 15.8596, which is higher than the industry average. Additionally, the stock's Price to Book (P/B) ratio of 1.10903 indicates that investors are paying more for each dollar of book value than they would for similar companies. Overall, while CITI's upward trend is promising, investors may want to exercise caution before jumping into the stock. The mixed technical indicators and elevated valuations suggest that the stock may be due for a pullback or consolidation period in the near future. Nonetheless, long-term investors who believe in the company's fundamentals may view this as an opportunity to buy the dip and accumulate shares at a discounted price.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Wecome Intelligent Manufacturing\n\nThe Wecome Intelligent Manufacturing Co Ltd is a Chinese company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

Beijing's new tactic might\nwork.\n    The People's Bank of China, after implementing a telegraphed 50 basis-point\ncut in banks' reserve ratio effective Friday, also executed the 20 bps lowering\nof the seven-day reverse repo rate. In possibly a final salvo before China's Oct\n1-7 holiday, the PBOC unexpectedly slashed the 14-day reverse repo rate by 20\nbps, on the heels of Monday's 10 bps cut.\n    Chinese stocks extended their gains, with the Shanghai Composite rising 1%\nand the Hang Seng leaping 2.7%. Equities are enjoying their best week in 16\nyears, while the yuan has only retreated slightly Friday following its rapid\ngains.\n    While economists have pointed out that lower borrowing costs and increased\nliquidity won't address anaemic credit demand, and the effect of capital\nmarket-boosting measures might be fleeting, some are changing their tune with\nthis week's onslaught of stimulus announcements and a clear paradigm shift by\nChina's leadership. \n    Following the Politburo's pledge to essentially spend as much as needed to\nhit its 2024 GDP growth target, Reuters reported that the government intends to\nissue $284 billion in sovereign debt this year to revive the economy.\n    And Beijing isn't just throwing money at its economic problems. \n    The Politburo has vowed to arrest the property market decline, after\nunveiling various measures to spur home-buying. It has also assured stronger\nefforts to help youth find jobs, while handing out cash to the needy, in an\nunprecedented consumption push. \n    The government is even roping in the private sector, in what could be seen\nas an admission that the 2020 clamp-down was a mistake.\n    If China can change its mind, so should global investors.\n    For more click on [FXBUZ] \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nChinese stocks roar on stimulus-fueled optimism:    https://reut.rs/3Boc21B\nCNH:     https://tmsnrt.rs/4eBp3TK\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Ewen Chew is a Reuters market analyst.

Dollar selling from China's major state-owned banks on Tuesday to stem the yuan's decline helped cap its losses.\n\nThe offshore yuan stood at 7.2089 per dollar.\n\n'It's great to see the news. It's a necessary first step to alleviate debt burden, stimulate long term investment, and bolster stock market confidence,' said Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China.\n\nFurther rate cuts in China\n\n'In the next step, we will see if policymakers will continuously lower rates by big amount, one time big cut is not enough to reverse market expectation.'\n\nThe Aussie, often used as a liquid proxy for the yuan, fell 0.15 percent to $0.6530, while the New Zealand dollar lost 0.19 percent to $0.61385, as the move from China failed to substantially boost investor optimism.\n\nIn the broader market, the greenback rose 0.2 percent to 150.42 yen, having already surpassed the key 150 yen level for six straight sessions and prompting warnings from Japanese officials in a bid to stabilize the currency.\n\nHigher-than-expected U.S. producer prices and consumer prices data last week further scaled back market expectations of how soon, and by how much, the Federal Reserve could ease interest rates this year, with futures pointing to just about 90 basis points worth of cuts in 2024, down from about 160 bps at the end of last year.\n\nRents boost US consumer prices in Jan\n\nOn the other hand, Japan's economy, which unexpectedly slipped into a recession in the final quarter of last year on sluggish consumption and capital expenditure, has prompted investors to rethink the chances of a near-term exit by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) from its ultra-loose monetary policy.\n\nJapan's ultra-loose monetary policy\n\n'At the moment, the data coming in from Japan is telling us that it's not as rosy as what the BOJ would like to see in order to begin moving away from negative interest rates,' said Rodrigo Catril, senior currency strategist at National Australia Bank.\n\nThe euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.0768, while sterling dipped 0.13 percent to $1.25795.\n\n'We're still stuck in these ranges to some extent, and waiting for more meaningful or material data to swing us one way or the other,' said Catril. 'So for that, data coming from the U.S. remains paramount.'\n\nIn the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields ticked higher in response to last week's inflation data and the repricing of Fed expectations.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year yield was last at 4.3009 percent, while the two-year yield steadied at 4.6463 percent.\n\nThe dollar index, a measure of the greenback against its major peers, rose 0.08 percent to 104.37.\n\nDown Under, a still-cautious Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) similarly reinforced bets that rate cuts were likely still some way off, after minutes of the central bank's February meeting out on Tuesday showed policymakers need more time to be confident inflation is on the decline before it can rule out another hike in interest rates."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "By Apple Li\n\nHONG KONG, Aug 9 (IFR) - Offshore renminbi, or Dim Sum, financings are\ncontinuing to find appeal among Chinese borrowers tapping the Hong Kong loan\nmarket thanks to a persistent divergence in the direction of interest rates\nbetween China and the US.\n\nAt least three Chinese borrowers are raising loans carrying offshore renminbi\ntranches, including a US$5.5bn-equivalent refinancing for Ant Group, a\nborrowing of up to US$650m for state-owned supply chain services provider\nXiamen Xiangyu Group, and a Rmb1.5bn-equivalent (US$209m) financing for miner\nSinomine Resources Group.\n\nThese will add to the US$1.84bn-equivalent in Dim Sum loans already completed\nso far this year, which represents 9.1% of the total loan volume of US$20.14bn\nraised by Chinese corporates in Hong Kong. This compares to the 3.7% market\nshare that Dim Sum loans recorded in 2023, according to LSEG LPC data.\n\nMeanwhile, Indonesian courier services provider J&T Global Express and Hong\nKong-based United Asia Finance are in the market for a US$1bn-equivalent loan\nand a HK$2bn-equivalent (US$256m) facility, respectively, that also carries\noffshore renminbi tranches.\n\n“Offshore renminbi loans remain an attractive option for borrowers as the\ncost of US dollar-denominated financing remains high,” said Phyllis Ng, head\nof loan syndication at China Construction Bank (Asia). “This is a trend that\nis expected to continue growing until we start to see meaningful interest rate\ncuts in the US.”\n\nLast year, offshore renminbi loans totalled US$2.22bn-equivalent, against the\nUS$59.47bn in total loan volumes raised by Chinese borrowers in Hong Kong.\nThis already represented a significant jump from the US$138m-equivalent raised\nthrough such transactions in 2022.\n\nAs the gap between the costs of borrowing in the Chinese currency and the\ngreenback remains wide, borrowers with international funding needs are\nincreasingly leaning on the Dim Sum market compared to raising loans in US\ndollars. And even though the cost of offshore renminbi borrowing may be higher\nthan onshore levels, corporates with overseas funding needs are willing to pay\nthe premium due to the flexibility and convenience it offers.\n\nBorrowers in US dollars or offshore renminbi pay spreads over the respective\nthree-month US dollar SOFR and CNH Hibor rates of 5.36% and 2.57%, but onshore\ntop-tier borrowers can pay less than the one-year loan prime rate of 3.35%. In\nthe past 12 months the SOFR rate has risen by 24bp while the CNH Hibor rate\nhas been hovering around 2.5%–3.5%, after peaking at 4.48% in September 2023\nand 4.54% in April 2024. Over that period the LPR has come down by 20bp.\nChanging structures\nThe growth of Dim Sum loans in the syndicated loan market over the past year\nhas also encouraged innovative structuring and pricing approaches as borrowers\nand lenders look to achieve common ground.\n\nSome banks in Hong Kong prefer CNH Hibor as the benchmark as it better\nreflects their costs of funding, while some borrowers prefer using fixed\ninterest rates to avoid potential fluctuations in CNH Hibor, according to\nanother senior Hong Kong-based loan banker. Interest margins below the\none-year LPR are considered too tight for many banks, and with the People’s\nBank of China likely to cut the LPR further, some lenders are opting to offer\nfixed-rate loans to ensure more stability and predictability in their interest\nincome.\n\nAmong the deals in syndication, the three-year term loan for Sinomine\nResources offers a fixed interest rate of 3.9%. Ant Group is offering an\ninterest margin of 88bp over SOFR/CNH Hibor for its latest US$5.5bn-equivalent\nthree-year refinancing, while Xiamen Xiangyu’s three-year borrowing carries\nmargins of 135bp over SOFR for commitments in US dollars, and 120bp over CNH\nHibor or 10bp over one-year LPR for commitments in offshore renminbi.\n\n“The pricing on these deals really comes down to the bargaining power of the\nborrowers,” the banker said. “Stronger borrowers are often able to dictate\nthe specific pricing benchmarks they want to use. Meanwhile, some other\nborrowers opt to structure their deals with multiple pricing options in order\nto access the widest pool of liquidity from different lenders.”\nQuota preservation\nDim Sum loans help borrowers manage foreign exchange risks while using up\ntheir offshore borrowing quotas, which Chinese regulators might not renew if\nthey are not used.\n\n“While onshore loans may offer lower pricing, borrowers consider other\nfactors such as the flexibility of raising offshore loans in terms of the use\nof proceeds for overseas projects, the importance of maintaining their\noffshore borrowing limits as well as relationships with overseas banks,”\nsaid CCB (Asia)'s Ng.\n\nFor lenders, offshore renminbi loans present opportunities to deploy capital\namid a dearth of deal flow in Hong Kong as well as intense competition from\nChina’s domestic loan market.\n\nOverall lending opportunities are on the decline as a prolonged debt crisis in\nChina’s real estate sector as well as a slower-than-expected economic\nrecovery has hurt demand for credit. US dollar fundraising activity for China\nInc in Hong Kong, traditionally the offshore funding centre for Chinese\nborrowers, plunged 37% year on year to US$10.16bn in the first half of 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, the liquidity pool for offshore renminbi in Hong Kong\nremains strong. As at the end of June, renminbi-denominated deposits in Hong\nKong totalled Rmb1.06trn, compared with Rmb907.3bn a year earlier, according\nto the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\n(Reporting by Apple Li; Editing by Prakash Chakravarti)\n\n((apple.li@lseg.com; Twitter: @LPCLoans; +852 3853 4367))\n\nStory Id: 4748463\n\n\n\nCopyright © LSEG 2024.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial trades 6.08 percent higher on Thursday 26th of SeptemberSep 25, 2024\n\nShandong Bohui Paper Industrial (600966.SS) traded up 6.08 % during a 24 hours period ending at 05:00 AM Central Europe on Thursday 26th. One Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial stock can currently be bought for about CNY 4.16 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial stocks is 1.2 bn. Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial has a current market capitalization of CNY 5 bn and approximately CNY 61.6 mn worth of Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial has traded -2.43 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 5.27. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 7.17 on 10/31/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 3.61 on 09/18/2024.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Shaanxi Heimao Coking (601015.SS) traded up 3.94 % and now trades at CNY 2.96. Current market capitalisation for Shaanxi Heimao Coking is CNY 5.9 bn.\n\n- Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion (603583.SS) traded up 3.99 % and now trades at CNY 16.02. Current market capitalisation for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is CNY 5.9 bn. Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion has a current price to earnings ratio of 18.89. Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Fujian Apex Software (603383.SS) traded up 10 % and now trades at CNY 29.41.

Title: Fujian Apex Software's Strong Fundamentals Drive Growth Potential Investors looking for a promising investment opportunity may want to consider Fujian Apex Software Co Ltd (FAS), a software development company based in China. Despite the lack of recent news, the company's strong fundamentals suggest that it could be poised for growth in the long term. According to data from Finanzen.net, the last known news about FAS dates back to August 29th, when the company presented its quarterly results. As of September 11th, the stock has maintained a steady closing price of 25.51 CNH, with a 52-week high of 55 CNH reached on September 26th, 2023, and a 52-week low of 23.25 CNH recorded on August 28th, 2024. These figures indicate a relatively stable performance over the past year, with a slight upward trend. One key metric that stands out for FAS is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 24.49, which suggests that the market is undervaluing the company's earning potential. This is supported by the company's strong financial health, with a Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 4, indicating that the company's assets are worth significantly more than its current market value. While there have been no recent developments or announcements regarding FAS, the company's solid track record and strong financials make it an attractive investment option for those seeking long-term growth. With a history of stability and a promising future ahead, FAS could be a valuable addition to any portfolio.\n\n- Zhejiang Lante Optics (688127.SS) traded up 6.07 % and now trades at CNY 15.44.

One Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech stock can currently be bought for about CNY 36.32 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech stocks is 113.8 mn. Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech has a current market capitalization of CNY 4.5 bn and approximately CNY 25.4 mn worth of Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours.

The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 118.42 on 09/25/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 33.97 on 07/18/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: Shanghai V-Test Semiconductor Tech's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into Shanghai V-Test Semiconductor Tech (SVTS) may be scratching their heads after the latest quarterly results and fluctuating stock performance. Despite the lack of recent news, we can analyze the company's historical data to identify trends and patterns that might influence future growth. Priced at 37.08 CNY as of yesterday's close, SVTS has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the past year, with its 52-week high reaching 118.42 CNY on September 24th, 2023, and dipping to a low of 33.97 CNY on July 17th, 2024. This significant volatility suggests that investors have been uncertain about the company's long-term prospects. Looking at the company's Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, we find that it stands at an elevated 51.8819, indicating that investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of earnings. However, this could also suggest that the market expects strong future growth, which would justify the higher valuation. On the other hand, the Price to Book (P/B) ratio of 1.89442 indicates that investors are paying approximately twice the value of the company's book assets. While this could indicate undervaluation, it's essential to consider other factors before making any conclusions. SVTS's mixed signals continue when examining its chart pattern. After peaking in late September 2023, the stock experienced a sharp correction, falling by nearly 70% to reach its lowest point in mid-July 2024. Since then, the stock has recovered slightly but remains below its previous highs. This choppy price action suggests that investors are still trying to determine the company's true worth. To summarize, while there haven't been any recent developments regarding Shanghai V-Test Semiconductor Tech, our technical analysis reveals a complex picture of mixed signals. Investors must carefully evaluate the company's historical performance, financial ratios, and chart patterns to make informed decisions about whether to buy or sell SVTS shares.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Fujian Apex Software (603383.SS) traded up 0.52 % and now trades at CNH 25.97.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "US Dollar Returns Bid on the Back of Firmer RatesSep 09, 2024\n\nOverview: After falling following the US jobs report before the weekend, US interest rates have come back firmer, helping the give the dollar a boost. A downward revision to Japan's Q2 GDP, reflecting weaker consumption, business investment, and a little more inflation, have heled the greenback retrace the pre-weekend losses against the yen. Softer than expected price gauges, the setback of the yen, and the rise in US rates has seen the offshore yuan fall by the most in three weeks. The US dollar is firmer against all the G10 currencies but the Canadian dollar. Most emerging market currencies are also softer but the Mexican peso. \n\nAfter falling by 2.4% last week, the MSCI Asia Pacific has begun the new week on the defensive. All the large markets in the region fell except India. China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan lost more than 1%. Europe's Stoxx 600 is snapping a five-day drop. It is up nearly 0.75% in late morning turnover. Us index futures are recovering from the pre-weekend slide. The S&P 500 is up around 0.7% and the NASDAQ is about 0.90%. Yields are broadly higher. The 10-year JGB yield rose nearly 5 bp (to ~0.89%). European benchmark yields are 4-6 bp higher. Gold is flat and consolidating at the lower end of last Friday's range. It has been confined to a roughly $2485-$2500 range so far today. October WTI fell almost 8% last week, its fourth consecutive weekly loss, and to its lowest level of the year (~$67.15). It is trading quietly today (~$68.00-$68.85). \n\nAsia Pacific\n\nChina's consumer disinflation is ending, and it is not because consumer demand has improved.Unfavorable weather and a low base for pork prices appear to be the driver. At the same time, China's intense domestic competition--which is the closely related to the surplus capacity issue, also serves to weigh on price. China's August CPI is 0.6% higher year-over-year, slightly higher than the 0.5% in July. The core rate, which excludes food and energy rose 0.3% year-over-year, the slowest of the year. Consumer goods prices rose 0.7% over the past 12-months, the fastest of the year, while service priced edged up 0.5%, the least of the year. Producer prices deteriorated for the first time since March. After finishing 2023 at -2.7%, Chinese producer prices rose to -0.8% in June and July before falling to -1.8% in August. The output price index as China's PMI fell to 42.0 in August (46.3 in July). It is the lowest since May 2023. The weakness in producer prices suggest profits will remain under pressure. We note that China reported that reserves rose by almost $31.85 bln in August to $3.29 trillion, the highest since the end of 2015. It appears to be largely accounted for by the valuation adjustments (decline in the dollar and interest rates). Meanwhile, revisions to Japan's Q2 GDP were minor and the focus is on inflation and Q3 data. The 3.1% growth in Q2 was revised to 2.9% as consumption and capex were revised lower. The growth was partly a payback for the 3.2% contraction. Growth this quarter looks to be 1.5%-2.0% at an annualized clip. The deflator was revised to 3.2% from 3.0%. Japan also reported its July current account. True to the seasonal pattern, it widened from June (JPY3.19 trillion vs. JPY1.53 trillion) as it has done without failure since 2002. It did so, however, even though the trade balance deteriorated. The JPY483 bln deficit compares with a JPY556 bln in June, and JPY107 bln in July 2023. \n\nThe dollar entered today with a four-day slide against the yen in tow and after a wobble at the start of the session it recovered.The yen's rise does not appear to be the critical driver that it was in late July into early August. Through last Tuesday, speculators in the CME futures grew their net long yen position by 15.2k contracts to 41.1k. This was a function of new longs being established and shorts covered in roughly equal measures. Ahead of the weekend, the dollar posted its lowest close since early January slightly below JPY142.50, where $1.75 bln in option are to expire Wednesday. It slipped briefly below JPY142 and recovered toward JPY143.65, holding so far below the pre-weekend high (~JPY144). The greenback's gains have been supported by a recovery in US yields (5-6 bp).The Australian dollar is weak from the technical perspective after the big outside down day before the weekend. The pre-weekend low was near $0.6660, and the losses have been marginally extended today to slightly below $0.6655.A possible head and shoulders topping pattern projects to a little below $0.6600. The five-day moving average is crossing below the 20-day moving average. The position adjustment around today's expiry of almost A$315 mln options at $0.6700 may have contributed to the Aussie selling before the weekend. Still, the stretched intraday momentum indicators suggest it can recover toward $0.6670-80 area.The rise in US rates and the pullback in the yen put the yuan on its backfoot.The greenback, which tested the CNH7.0735 at the end of last week, reached a five-day high near CNH7.1245 today, near the 20-day moving average. Moreover, the offshore yuan is weaker than the onshore yuan, suggesting the near-term directional bias. Near-term potential appears to extend to CNH7.15. Last week’s less than 0.1% gain was sufficient for the dollar to snap a six-week drop against onshore yuan. The reference rate was set at CNY7.0989 (CNY7.0925 at the end of last week). \n\nEurope\n\nThe eurozone highlight of the week is Thursday's ECB meeting.The swaps market is fully discounting a 25 bp cut that will bring the deposit rate to 3.50%. It may also make a technical adjustment to narrow the spread between the deposit rate and main refinancing rate to 15 bp from 50 bp. The staff will update its forecasts. The swaps market another cut fully discount this year (two meetings left) and almost a 50% chance of another. The Bank of England meets on September 19 and the swaps market has about a 25% chance of cut. Assuming that is correct, there are about 45 bp in cuts discounting for the last two meetings of the year. Tomorrow's employment data may have more sway that the July GDP data and details on Wednesday. \n\nThe euro did not sustain the upside momentum that carried it to $1.1155 ahead of the weekend.It reversed to fall through Thursday's low (~$1.1075), but the settlement was inside Thursday's range. Follow-through selling today pushed it near $1.1045. A close below $1.1075 may boost the likelihood that the euro's downside correction is intact. Last week's low was near $1.1025. The next target is the $1.0990-$1.1000, but initially in North America, gains toward $1.1080 are reasonable given the positioning of the intraday momentum indicators.Sterling posted a bearish outside down day.Unlike the euro, it settled below Thursday's low after taking out its high earlier. It has slipped through last week's low (~$1.3090) and the next target is around $1.3035 on the way to maybe $1.2965. Still, the intraday momentum indicators suggest a bounce in the early North American turnover is likely. Initial resistance is seen around $1.3120. \n\nAmerica\n\nThe US employment was sufficiently mixed, especially if the 142k jobs growth is discounted by the average revision, and the Fed-speak sufficiently ambiguous as to encourage the market not bet too heavily on 50 bp rate cuts.Officials signaled a series of rate cuts. No one shied away from that. The issue is pace. The underlying signal seems to be that the base case is for a 25 bp cut this month but officials seem open to quicker moves if the labor market continues to weaken. One of the implications is that Wednesday's CPI may not play a significant role in the Fed's reaction function. Some are still critical of Fed and believe it should have cut rates in July. Maybe. Two mitigating factors. First, given the lag times, a few weeks one way or the other is unlikely to make much of a difference. Second, it is not as if the market has stood still. In a little more than four months, the US 2-year yield has fallen by 140 bp. The average 30-year mortgage rate has fallen by around 75 bp to 6.75%, the lowest in around 18 months. For its part, Mexico will report its August CPI, today, a couple of days ahead of the US. The headline and core rates are expected to have moderated. The central bank meets on September 26 and a Fed rate cut could help persuade Banxico to cut as well. \n\nThe US dollar posted a large outside up day against the Canadian dollar.After initially falling to a new low for the week near CAD1.3465, the greenback reversed course to rally to CAD1.3580. The US dollar's 0.5% gain ahead of the weekend was the largest advance in three months. It approached the 200-day moving average (~CAD1.3585). There has been no follow-through US dollar buying today and the greenback is consolidating in a narrow range above CAD1.3550. The range may be extended to the downside in North America, but consolidation is the most likely scenario.The US dollar settled at its highest level against the Mexican peso since October 2022 (~MXN19.97) ahead of the weekend.Still the greenback has not settled above MN20.00 despite trading above it on an intraday basis. There are about $490 mln in options struck at MXN20.00 that expire today. Given the cost of being short the peso (interest rate differential), once it becomes clear that the momentum is stalling (and the momentum indicators are stretched), peso shorts will feel the pressure to cover. It, too, is consolidating today.  \n\nDisclaimer \n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

This surge followed the PBoC's decision to maintain key lending rates during the September fixing, in line with market expectations. The one-year loan prime rate (LPR), the benchmark for most corporate and household loans, remained unchanged at 3.35%, while the five-year rate, a reference for property mortgages, held steady at 3.85%. Both rates are still at record lows following unexpected cuts in July. Externally, the yuan’s appreciation is also supported by a pressured US dollar, as the Fed's substantial rate cut has increased the chances of a potential soft landing for the US economy."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 71.3 on 09/26/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 26.3 on 08/29/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Skshu Paint\n\nSkshu Paint Co Ltd: Technical Analysis Investors looking for a value play may want to take a closer look at Skshu Paint Co Ltd (SKSHU), a paint manufacturer that has seen its stock experience significant fluctuations over the past year. As of September 17th, the stock closed at 26.87 CNH, down from its 52-week high of 73.2 CNH reached on September 20th, 2023. Despite the decline, SKSHU's fundamentals remain strong, with a Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) of 223.72 and a Price to Book Ratio (P/B) of 5.66. These ratios suggest that the stock may be undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. Looking back at the company's historical performance, SKSHU has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the past year. After reaching its 52-week high in September 2023, the stock saw a sharp correction, falling to a low of 26.3 CNH on August 28th, 2024. However, the stock has since recovered some of these losses, driven by improving financial results and positive industry trends. From a technical perspective, SKSHU's chart pattern suggests that the stock may be poised for further upside. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 48.67, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for potential growth. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is showing a bullish crossover, suggesting that the upward momentum may continue in the near term. Overall, investors who are willing to take on some risk may find SKSHU an attractive opportunity for long-term gains. However, it is important to keep a close eye on the company's financial performance and any developments in the broader market before making a decision.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Gemdale (600383.SS) traded up 1.24 % and now trades at CNH 4.01. Gemdale has a market capitalisation of CNH 18.2 bn. Gemdale Corp: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Investors looking to gain a foothold in the Chinese real estate market may want to take a closer look at Gemdale Corp (GEMD.CN), whose shares have been trading within a tight range over the past few months. Despite lacking any recent news, a technical analysis of the asset provides some interesting insights. As of September 20th, the last closing price of Gemdale was 4.03 CNH, down from its 52-week high of 7.14 CNH reached on September 24th, 2023. However, the stock has struggled to break above its previous resistance level, currently hovering around 4.20 CNH. This could be an indication that the upward momentum has slowed, at least in the short term. On the other hand, Gemdale's 52-week low of 2.89 CNH, hit on July 28th, 2024, suggests that the stock has experienced significant support at this level. Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 46.67, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, which could be seen as a neutral signal for potential investors. Another important metric to consider is the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) of -3.97, which indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. Furthermore, the price-to-book ratio of 0.25707 suggests that the stock is reasonably priced based on its assets. In conclusion, while there appears to be limited news driving Gemdale's share price recently, a technical analysis reveals a mixed picture. While the stock has struggled to break above its previous resistance level, it has also shown significant support at its 52-week low. Potential investors may want to keep a close eye on the stock's movement in the coming days and weeks to determine whether it will continue to trade within this range or break out to new heights.\n\n- Cofco Sugar (600737.SS) traded up 1.76 % and now trades at CNH 8.69.

Title: Technical Analysis: Ningbo Xusheng's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Chinese automotive technology firm Ningbo Xusheng may be scratching their heads after reviewing the company's latest financial reports and market trends. Despite showing promise with its 52-week high of 24.04 CNH (Chinese Yuan) recorded on September 24th, 2023, the stock has experienced a significant downturn in recent months, with its current price standing at 8.43 CNH as of yesterday's closing bell. A closer look at Ningbo Xusheng's historical price movements reveals a pattern of fluctuations that have left analysts divided. The company's 52-week range has been quite volatile, spanning from a low of 8.3 CNH on September 17th, 2024, to a high of 24.04 CNH on September 24th, 2023. This wide range reflects the challenges faced by the auto industry as a whole, as well as the company's efforts to navigate these turbulent waters. One positive indicator for Ningbo Xusheng is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio), which stands at 13.88. This suggests that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of the company's earnings, indicating confidence in its long-term growth prospects. However, the company's Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 1.26 indicates that the stock may be overvalued compared to its peers, given its relatively modest book value. Technically speaking, Ningbo Xusheng's current price position appears to be testing the lower boundary of its Bollinger Bands, a chart pattern that measures volatility and helps identify potential breakouts or reversals. If the stock can manage to hold above this level, it could signal a bullish reversal and potentially lead to a rebound towards its 52-week high. Conversely, a breach below this support could send the stock tumbling further downwards. In conclusion, while Ningbo Xusheng's mixed signals make it difficult to predict its short-term trajectory, the company's fundamentals and technical indicators suggest that there may be opportunities for savvy investors who are willing to take a contrarian approach. As always, thorough research and risk assessment are essential before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Cloudwalk (688327.SS) traded down -1.86 % and now trades at CNY 7.7. Cloudwalk has a market capitalisation of CNY 8.2 bn. Title: CloudWalk Technology's Latest Quarterly Numbers Spark Optimism Investors are keeping a close eye on CloudWalk Technology Co Ltd (CWD) as the company continues to show promising growth in its latest quarterly numbers. According to the company's most recent financial report, CloudWalk's revenue has been steadily increasing over the past year, with a notable jump in sales during the third quarter of 2023. Looking at the charts, CloudWalk's stock has been trending upwards since the beginning of the year, with a significant spike in mid-March. This surge can be attributed to the company's impressive earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2023, which showed a 26% increase in revenue compared to the same period the previous year. Since then, the stock has continued to climb, reaching an all-time high of 22 CNY on November 14th, 2023. However, after hitting this peak, CloudWalk's stock experienced a slight correction, falling to a low of 7.39 CNY on September 8th, 2024. This drop can be attributed to investor profit-taking and concerns about the company's ability to sustain its rapid growth. Despite this pullback, analysts remain bullish on the company's long-term prospects, citing its strong fundamentals and growing market share. Current Price and Valuation: As of yesterday's closing bell, CloudWalk's stock closed at 7.54 CNY, representing a gain of over 20% since the start of the year. At its current price, the company's valuation stands at approximately 20 billion CNY, making it one of the more expensive stocks in the technology sector. However, given its robust financials and growth potential, many analysts believe that CloudWalk is still undervalued and has room to run in the coming months. In conclusion, CloudWalk Technology Co Ltd appears to be well-positioned for future growth, with a strong track record of increasing revenue and a solid balance sheet. While the stock may experience some short-term volatility due to market fluctuations, the long-term outlook for the company remains positive. As such, savvy investors may want to consider taking a position in CloudWalk before its value rises further.\n\n- Rising Nonferrous Metals Share (600259.SS) traded down -1.81 % and now trades at CNH 24.11.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "May 23 (Reuters) - Are a peak in US growth optimism and hawkish Fed\npricing sufficient reasons to turn bearish on the USD? Deutsche Bank are not\nconvinced and remain bullish on the dollar in a recently published note. \n    1. Still little policy divergence priced. Deutsche note that six of the\nGroup of 10 central banks are all priced to cut a near-identical 130-140bps to\nthe Fed through end-2025. With U.S. fiscal policy among the most\ngrowth-supportive in the G10 and policy pass-through the least, the risks still\nseem skewed towards pricing more policy divergence between the Fed and the rest\nof the world. Even with current pricing, the dollar is set to remain the second\nhighest yielding currency in the developed world.\n    2. U.S. election constraint to USD downside. USD is a safe haven in times of\ngeopolitical turmoil and the U.S. election falls into that category. Donald\nTrump's trade proposals are also seen as USD positive if he should defeat\nincumbent Joe Biden in November's presidential contest and return to the White\nHouse.\n    3. European backdrop remains challenging. European growth has improved as\nexpected since the start of the year and is counterbalanced by three arguments\naccording to Deutsche. Firstly the ECB appears on track to cut rates in June,\nwhich has attracted euro weakness in previous easing cycles and could be more\npronounced given that the Fed usually cuts first. Secondly, while global growth\nis recovering, its pace is subdued and inconsistent with a euro rally. Thirdly,\nGermany's structural challenges remain acute, most evident in business surveys\nwhich put its external competitiveness at multi-decade lows. With German fiscal\npolicy expected to stay tight into 2025, it's hard to see a sustained recovery\nin growth prospects until then.\n    Deutsche have a negative bias on EUR, CHF, JPY and SEK, which have a\ncombined weight of 80% and a positive carry of more than 2% in the DXY which\nthey like buying. Carry matters in this low volatility environment and with the\nUSD index already approaching last year's highs in total return terms. \n    The biggest risks to the USD in Deutsche Bank's view are an unexpected\ndownturn in US data or a pivot to emphasizing a weak-dollar policy from a\npotential Trump administration. \n\n    For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n=USD - index    https://tmsnrt.rs/3UQROU9\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

The index\nbroke above the 3,000 points psychological barrier early Friday\nbut is now flailing around that watermark. A daily closing above\n2,979 would clear its Ichimoku cloud resistance zone, paving a\nway higher. That could restart the USD/CNH descent, which has\nstalled after bouncing off its own cloud barrier at 7.1990. A\nFriday close below 7.1954, the entrance of the daily Bollinger\ndowntrend channel, would put it back on track. While officials\naccelerate efforts to support stocks after a leadership change\nat the securities regulator, Chinese FX authorities continue to\nput up a resolute defence of the currency via direct market\nintervention as well as through the stubbornly stable USD/CNY\nfixing. This implies the yuan will only be allowed to react\npositively to Chinese stock movements.\n\n ((ifr.fx@thomsonreuters.com))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

The currency was trading near its strongest\nlevel since early January.\n    The dollar <=USD> dropped 0.5% against major currencies to\ntrade at 102.62 - a near five-month low.  \n    \"Fears of a U.S. recession mean that the market is no longer\nlooking for an orderly adjustment in Fed policy towards some\nkind of neutral rate - say near 3.25%. No, the fear of a\nrecession is now bringing in the idea of stimulative monetary\npolicy,\" noted Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING.\n    \"It is no surprise to see low-yielding currencies now in the\nascendancy as the rest of the world now starts to converge on\ntheir low interest rates.\"\n        The yen has jumped 14% against the dollar over the past\nthree weeks, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's 15-basis\npoints rate rise last week to 0.25%, alongside which it\nannounced a plan to halve its monthly bond purchases over the\nnext couple of years.\n    Barclays analysts said the Japanese currency was the most\noverbought among G10 majors, and therefore \"the bar for yet more\noutperformance in the near term appears high\".\n    The Swiss franc <CHF=EBS>, another popular funding currency,\nwas up more than 1% at 0.84825 to the dollar. The franc, a\ntraditional safe haven, was also trading at a seven-month high. \n    High-yielding currencies such as the Indian rupee <INR=IN>\nand Mexican peso <MXN=> tumbled, while currencies that had\nhitherto been used for funding investments, such as the yen and\nChina's yuan  <CNH=>, rallied strongly.     \n    Treasury yields have been falling quite sharply since last\nweek, when the Federal Reserve kept the policy rate in its\ncurrent 5.25% to 5.50% range while Chair Jerome Powell opened\nthe possibility of a rate cut in September.\n    But by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate had\njumped, which sparked chatter the U.S. economy could be heading\nfor a recession, expectations for rate cuts deepened.\n    Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries <US10YT=RR> sank nearly 40\nbasis points last week, the largest weekly fall since March\n2020, and were last at 3.75%.\n    Fed fund futures reflected traders pricing a near 99% chance\nof a 50 basis point cut at the central bank's September meeting,\naccording to LSEG data. Futures imply 127 basis points of cuts\nthis year.\n        The euro was up 0.2% at $1.0954 <EUR=EBS> despite the\nexpectation for interest rate cuts from the European Central\nBank (ECB) surging. Traders now see more than 90 basis points of\nrate cut from the ECB this year, versus 50 bps at the start of\nlast week.  \n    Meanwhile, markets are also dealing with the risk of\nmilitary escalation in the Middle East after latest developments\nin the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which has driven\noil prices <CLc1> to their lowest since January. \n    The U.S. military is deploying more forces in the Middle\nEast and Europe following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas\nand Hezbollah to respond to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail\nHaniyeh last week in Tehran.\n     \n    \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates    https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\nFX moves 10 days    https://tmsnrt.rs/4dpFKRs\nGraphic-US unemployment rate     https://tmsnrt.rs/3piciFu\nGraphic-US inflation and interest rates    https://reut.rs/4fvmDas\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore and Sruthi Shankar\nin Bengaluru; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Ros Russell)\n ((Vidya.ranganathan@tr.com))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Asia FX weakens as M.East tensions, rate fears put dollar at over 5-mth highInvesting.com-- Most Asian currencies weakened on Tuesday, while the dollar rose to over five-month highs amid rising geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel and increased bets on higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates.\n\nStronger-than-expected Chinese gross domestic product data helped inspire some optimism towards Asia's biggest economy, but the reading was offset by other middling economic indicators.\n\nChinese yuan flat as Q1 GDP beats estimates\n\nThe Chinese yuan moved little on Tuesday, with the USDCNY pair hovering well over 7.2 even as GDP data showed the economy grew more than expected in the first quarter.\n\nBut this was undermined by softer-than-expected industrial production and retail sales data for March, which suggested that momentum in the Chinese economy may already be slowing after a strong start to the year.\n\nThe People's Bank of China also set a weak midpoint for the yuan, given that the central bank has limited headroom to keep supporting the Chinese currency. The offshore yuan's USDCNH pair sank 0.2%, reflecting persistent selling biases towards the yuan.\n\nWhile monetary stimulus measures are expected to help support the Chinese economy, they herald more weakness for the yuan in the coming months.\n\nDollar at over 5-mth high as rate cut bets wane, Powell awaited\n\nThe dollar index and dollar index futures rose 0.1% each in Asian trade, hitting their highest levels since early-November. The greenback's latest gains came as U.S. retail sales data read hotter-than-expected for March, further underpinning inflation expectations.\n\nThe retail sales data came just days after stronger-than-expected inflation readings for March saw traders largely price out bets on a June rate cut by the Federal Reserve.\n\nFocus is now on an address by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, due later on Tuesday, for more cues on the path of interest rates and the U.S. economy.\n\nFears of higher-for-longer U.S. rates, coupled with weak risk appetite amid growing tensions in the Middle East, were a key weight on Asian currencies. Safe haven demand also saw traders largely favor the dollar.\n\nThe Australian dollar- usually seen as a key indicator of risk appetite, retreated on Tuesday, with the AUDUSD pair falling 0.4% to a five-month low.\n\nThe South Korean's USDKRW pair rose 0.9% to a 17-month high, while the Singapore dollar's USDSGD pair rose 0.3%.\n\nThe Indian rupee's USDINR pair was close to record highs, trading well above the 83.5 level.\n\nJapanese yen on intervention watch as USDJPY hits 34-yr high\n\nThe Japanese yen weakened further this week, with the USDJPY pair rising to a new 34-year high above 154.\n\nRecent weakness in the yen came even as several Japanese government officials warned against excessive forex speculation- a trend that is expected to spur intervention in currency markets.\n\nThis kept traders on guard for any potential intervention by the Japanese government, which usually entails selling high amounts of dollars to bring down the USDJPY pair.\n\n?

Title: Technical Analysis: Anhui Conch Cement's Shares Slip Below Key Level In our latest technical analysis, we take a closer look at Anhui Conch Cement Co Ltd (OTCMKTS:AHCHY), whose shares have recently passed below a key level. As of the last closing price of 20.08 HKD, the stock has dipped below its 50-day moving average of 11.88, indicating a potential downward trend. This development may be concerning for investors who have been following the company's progress over the past year. Looking back at the past 52 weeks, Anhui Conch Cement has experienced a range of highs and lows. The stock reached its peak of 27.08 HKD on September 19th, 2023, before falling to its lowest point of 19.61 HKD on September 10th, 2024. This volatility has resulted in a price to earnings ratio of 10.97 and a price to book ratio of 0.44279, which provides insight into the company's value relative to its earnings and assets. From a technical standpoint, the stock's recent dip below its 50-day moving average could signal a bearish trend. However, it's important to note that this movement may also present an opportunity for savvy investors looking to buy low and hold for the long term. Our analysis suggests that the stock's current price of 20.08 HKD is near the lower end of its 52-week range, making it potentially undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. Overall, our technical analysis indicates that Anhui Conch Cement's shares may be experiencing a temporary downturn, but the company's fundamentals remain strong. Investors considering a position in the stock should carefully evaluate their risk tolerance and time horizon before making a decision.\n\n- China Communications Construction (601800.SS) traded up 0.7 % and now trades at HKD 7.29. Current market capitalisation for China Communications Construction is HKD 101.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for China Communications Construction is 5.2. China Communications Construction Co Ltd (CCC) has been relatively quiet in recent months, with no significant news updates since March 27th, 2024. However, a look at the company's historical stock performance reveals some interesting trends. As of September 20th, 2024, CCC's closing price stood at HKD 7.18, down from its 52-week high of HKD 9.9 on April 15th, 2024. This represents a decline of approximately 28% from its peak. On the other hand, the stock has experienced a slight uptick in recent days, up from its 52-week low of HKD 6.81 on January 22nd, 2024. Despite this volatility, CCC's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio remains relatively modest at 5.2, suggesting that investors may be undervaluing the company's earning potential. Additionally, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio stands at 0.38133, indicating that the stock may be trading at a discount compared to its book value. Technical analysts note that CCC's stock has been trending downwards over the past few months, but has recently found support at around HKD 7.00. If the stock can break above this level, it could potentially signal a reversal in the downward trend and point towards a bullish outlook. Conversely, a failure to hold this support could lead to further declines. In conclusion, while there have been no recent news updates on CCC, a review of its historical stock performance suggests that the company may be undervalued by investors. Technical indicators suggest that the stock may be poised for a rebound, but any such move would require a break above the HKD 7.00 mark.\n\n- Aecc Aviation Power (600893.SS) traded up 0.41 % and now trades at CNH 33.95.

The euro was up 0.37% to $1.095,\nafter rising as high as $1.1009, its strongest since Jan. 2. \n    Weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data, along with\ndisappointing earnings reports from large technology firms and\nheightened concerns over the Chinese economy, have sparked a\nglobal sell-off in stocks, oil and high-yielding currencies in\nthe past week as investors sought the safety of cash.\n    The selling continued on Monday, with U.S. Treasury yields\nfalling further, stock indexes in the red, bitcoin <BTC=> dumped\nand the dollar losing ground.\n    \"When you zoom out and look at the big picture, whenever\nthere's a crisis in markets, it's clear that there's far too\nmuch leverage and everyone is crowded into the same trades,\"\nsaid Adam Button, chief currency analyst at ForexLive. \n    Treasury yields have been falling sharply since last week,\nwhen the Fed kept the policy rate in its current 5.25% to 5.50%\nrange while Fed Chair Jerome Powell opened the possibility of a\nrate cut in September.\n    But by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate had\njumped, expectations for rate cuts rose.\n    \"Friday's (non-farm payrolls) report was a bit of a shock to\nthe global system, and markets are very worried that the U.S.\nmay no longer be a viable driver of global growth,\" said Helen\nGiven, FX trader at Monex USA in Washington.\n    The Japanese yen's surge comes as traders aggressively\nunwound carry trades. So-called carry trades, where investors\nborrow in money from economies with low interest rates such as\nJapan or Switzerland to fund investments in higher-yielding\nassets elsewhere, have been popular in recent years.\n    \"Whenever there's trouble, the rush to the exit is so\ndramatic that it creates these incredible waves in markets that\nswamp related markets,\" said Button. \"You never know how much\nmoney is piled into the carry trade until it unwinds.\"\n    On Monday, Fed fund futures reflected traders pricing a near\n100% chance of a 50 basis point cut at the central bank's\nSeptember meeting, according to CME FedWatch. \n    \"The Japanese equity sell-off during Asian trading spooked\nmarkets in a big way, coupled with the yen's resurgence, and we\nmay be seeing the so-called 'panic spiral' that many have been\nconcerned about,\" Monex's Given said.\n    Meanwhile, the Swiss franc <CHF=EBS>, another popular carry\ntrade funding currency, was 0.83% higher at 0.85 to the dollar.\nThe franc, a traditional safe haven, was also trading near a\nseven-month high.\n    The dollar found some relief against the British pound as\nthe marked deterioration in global investor risk sentiment\nsapped demand for riskier currencies. \n    The depreciation of Mexico's peso extended into its third\nday on Monday, and the U.S. dollar rose 1.64% to 19.48 pesos, on\ninvestor risk aversion. \n    In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin <BTC=> and ether <ETH=> plunged\non Monday to multi-month lows as investors a rushed out of risky\nassets. Bitcoin was down 15.11% to $53,094, heading for its\nlargest one-day fall since November 2022.

On Friday, it looked set for its\nfifth straight weekly gain, the longest winning streak in more\nthan three years.\n    While none of the underlying drivers at home, namely a weak\neconomy and capital flight, has changed, the yuan has been\nhelped by growing bets for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts,\nwhich are weakening the dollar, and by a rally in the Japanese\nyen.\n    Meanwhile, Chinese authorities have worked behind the scenes\nto ensure the currency doesn't spike abruptly, which could roil\nfragile domestic financial markets and hurt exporters. They have\nsurveyed the market to gauge the pressure, and quietly relaxed\nrestrictions on imports of gold and trading positions in the\nyuan for some banks.\n    \"The government is probably less concerned about\ndepreciation but remains wary of FX volatility,\" said Gary Ng,\nsenior economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis.\n    \"While the pressure on the yuan may ease as the Fed may\nfinally cut interest rates, there may be sudden and significant\nmovements in capital flows.\"\n        One big reason for the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to\nbe worried is the build-up of speculative short yuan positions\nduring the currency's steady decline since early 2023, which\ncould be unwound messily if the currency rises fast. \n        Foreign companies operating in China, domestic exporters\nand  investors have swapped yuan for dollars to earn better\nreturns in what is known in market circles as the yuan carry\ntrade.  \n        Analysts at the Macquarie Group estimate exporters and\nmultinational companies have accumulated foreign currency\nholdings of more than $500 billion since 2022.\n    \"As the yuan appreciates... concerns about the potential\nunwinding of yuan carry trade and shocks to financial markets\nmay arise,\" said Zhu Chaoping, global market strategist at J.P.\nMorgan Asset Management.\n    \"Recent market volatility in Japan might have reminded\npolicymakers about these risks.\"\n    China's currency regulator, the State Administration of\nForeign Exchange (SAFE), and the PBOC did not immediately\nrespond to Reuters requests for comment.\n        \n  \n    \n    PREVENT A STAMPEDE\n        Possibly to get an idea of pent-up yuan buying that\ncould come as the currency appreciates, SAFE surveyed banks\nabout their clients' FX conversion ratio - the proportion of\nrevenues exporters convert into yuan - last week, two people\nwith direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n    \"FX settlement is the issue that everyone in the market is\nmostly concerned about, besides the Fed rate cut,\" said Liu\nYang, general manager of the financial market business\ndepartment at minerals exporter Zheshang Development Group.\n    \"After all, exports are the only major driver of China's\neconomy among its traditional 'troika' (traditional growth\nengines), and regulators do not want the yuan to appreciate\nrapidly and substantially to weaken the competitiveness of\nexport products,\" he said.\n        Separately, guidance given to banks last year banning\nthem from keeping short yuan positions at the end of a day's\ntrading has also been relaxed for some banks, two people with\ndirect knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n    Chinese banks have also been given new gold import quotas by\nthe central bank, Reuters reported. Gold imports are usually\ncurtailed when the yuan faces depreciation pressures.\n    The measures are subtle, analysts said, and together with\nthe trend in the PBOC's daily benchmark guidance setting for the\nyuan, simply point to a desire to contain volatility, rather\nthan thwart gains.\n    Still, market participants are revising their yuan\nforecasts. \n    Analysts at BofA Securities expect the yuan will continue to\nweaken, \"given subdued growth and PBOC's easing bias\", but see\nthe yuan at 7.38 per dollar by year-end, not 7.45 as they had\npreviously forecast.

One Shenzhen China Micro Semicon stock can currently be bought for about CNY 16.89 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Shenzhen China Micro Semicon stocks is 400.4 mn. Shenzhen China Micro Semicon has a current market capitalization of CNY 6.5 bn and approximately CNY 59.5 mn worth of Shenzhen China Micro Semicon was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Shenzhen China Micro Semicon has traded -4.45 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 17.99. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 25.98 on 12/12/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 12.72 on 02/06/2024.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Shanghai Smi (600649.SS) traded up 0.98 % and now trades at CNH 3.07. Current market capitalisation for Shanghai Smi is CNH 7.8 bn. Shanghai Smi has a current price to earnings ratio of 263.07.\n\n- Fesco (600861.SS) traded down -2.04 % and now trades at CNH 12.98. Current market capitalisation for Fesco is CNH 7.8 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Fesco is 11.07. Title: FESCO Group Co Ltd's Delayed Annual Report Raises Investor Concerns In a recent development, Future Energy Source Company Limited (FESCO), a leading player in the renewable energy sector, has faced yet another delay in releasing its annual report for the year ended March 31, 2024. This latest setback has raised concerns among investors who have been eagerly awaiting the report to gain insights into the company's financial performance and future prospects. According to sources, the delayed report is likely to be released by the end of September 2024, which marks a significant departure from the original deadline of August 30, 2024. While the reason behind this delay remains unclear, industry experts speculate that it may be due to internal issues or complexities related to the company's financial statements. Despite these challenges, FESCO's stock performance has remained relatively stable over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing price, the company's shares were trading at 13.72 Chinese Yuan (CNH), down from its 52-week high of 25.6 CNH recorded on September 25, 2023. However, the stock has seen a significant drop from its 52-week low of 13.22 CNH on August 26, 2024. From a technical perspective, FESCO's current price of 13.72 CNH represents a discount of approximately 45% compared to its 52-week high. This presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors looking to capitalize on the company's potential for growth in the renewable energy sector. Moreover, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.21 and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.27 indicate undervaluation, suggesting that the market may be overlooking the company's strengths and potential for future expansion. In conclusion, while the delayed release of FESCO's annual report may cause temporary uncertainty among investors, the company's fundamentals and long-term growth prospects remain intact. With a strong track record of innovation and a commitment to sustainability, FESCO is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for clean energy solutions. Therefore, savvy investors may view this recent pullback as a buying opportunity ahead of what could be a significant recovery in the company's share price.\n\n- China Bester Telecom (603220.SS) traded down -2.1 % and now trades at CNH 16.83. Current market capitalisation for China Bester Telecom is CNH 7.7 bn.

Current market capitalisation for Red Star Macalline is HKD 8.5 bn. Title: Technical Analysis: Red Star Macalline's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Red Star Macalline Group Corp Ltd (RSS) may be left scratching their heads with the lack of recent news. However, by examining the company's historical stock data, we can uncover some interesting patterns that could shape our understanding of this Hong Kong-listed firm. Currently trading at 1.09 HKD, RSS has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the past year, with its 52-week high reaching 4.16 HKD on October 22nd, 2023, and dipping as low as 1.05 HKD on September 10th, 2024. This wide range of fluctuations highlights the volatility that investors have come to expect when dealing with RSS. One key metric that stands out is the Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio), which currently sits at -1.22. This indicates that the market expects RSS to underperform compared to its peers, given the negative value. However, the P/E Ratio has been trending downwards since April 2023, suggesting that investor sentiment may be shifting towards a more optimistic view of the company's future prospects. Another important metric is the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio), which stands at 0.0889. While this figure remains below the industry average, it represents an increase from the previous quarter's reading of 0.0764. This suggests that RSS may be gradually improving its financial health, although further observation is necessary to confirm this trend. Looking ahead, technical analysts will be keeping a close eye on RSS's support levels, particularly around the 1.05 HKD mark, where the stock has found resistance several times in the past. If broken, this level could serve as a catalyst for further upward momentum. On the flip side, a drop below 1.01 HKD could signal a return to bearish territory. In conclusion, while there appears to be limited news surrounding RSS at present, a closer look at its historical stock data reveals mixed signals that could be of interest to savvy investors. With the P/E Ratio trending downwards and the P/B Ratio increasing, the stage is set for a potential turnaround story. However, caution is advised until further clarity emerges regarding the company's future plans and financial health.\n\n- Shandong Weigao Orthopaedic Device (688161.SS) traded down -1.86 % and now trades at CNY 21.35.

Welcome to\nAsia Markets Briefing. I'm Thomas Warner. The Japanese and Chinese currencies\nhit two-week highs against the Dollar on Monday. FX traders pointed to a poll\nover the weekend that showed Democrat Kamala Harris taking a surprise\nthree-point lead in the swing state of Iowa. Growing confidence in a Trump win\nhad seen the Dollar index rally to a three-month high in October. With the\nelection due on Tuesday, it's likely to be a rocky few days in the currency\nmarkets. One-week implied volatility for the offshore Yuan is at its highest\nsince 2015, when China cut the value of its currency after a stock market\nrout. But the Indian Rupee fell to its weakest level on record on Monday. It's\nbeen hit by persistent outflows from local stocks. The NIFTY 50 suffered its\nbiggest daily drop in four weeks on Monday, persistent selling by overseas\ninvestors and a tepid earnings season means that the index is now down 9% from\nSeptember's record highs. The Culture Day national holiday in Japan and that\nno trading happened on the Nikkei. Korean and Chinese markets all made gains\nwith BYD leading the gains in Hong Kong. Shares in the car maker surged after\nit reported a 67% year-on-year increase in production and a 12% rise in Q3\nprofits. It's also hiring close to 200,000 new employees to help with\nmanufacturing. The bullish update gave a lift to the entire Chinese auto\nsector. China's Commerce Minister Wang Wentao met with French Junior Trade\nMinister Sophie Primas in Shanghai on Sunday. He urged Paris to take a\nâactive role in ending the escalating trade war between China and the\nEU.â Primas is on a three-day visit to challenge China over its import\nduties on Brandy, which Paris calls âpolitical and unjustified.â\nLooking ahead to the rest of this week now, and the Standing Committee of\nChina's National People's Congress is meeting until Friday. It's expected to\napprove spending and debt refinancing plans, which are aimed at boosting\ngrowth and shoring up local government. And on Wednesday, the Bank of Japan\npublishes the minutes from its September meeting. Former Bank of Japan Board\nMember Takahide Kiuchi said on Friday that the country's current political\nturmoil makes another rate hike unlikely until at least January, though he did\ncaution that any dramatic moves for the Yen could force the bank's hand when\nit meets on December 18. And over in Korea, the country's oil refiners\nreported sharp Q3 losses on Monday. SK Innovation, parent of South Korea's\nlargest refiner SK Energy, said that its refining business lost $450 million\nin the third quarter, the worst performance since Q4 of 2022. Oil prices fell\nthroughout the quarter, but have risen since, and Brent and WTI were both\ntrading higher on Monday after OPEC+ confirmed a second delay to its planned\nDecember output hike. The move reveals the depth of concern about weak demand,\nparticularly from Asia. The regions crude imports were down by 200,000 barrels\nper day in the first 10 months of this year, according to LSEG data.

As funds flow back into China's stock market, the cryptocurrency market, particularly USDT, has been experiencing significant declines.\n\nUSDT, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, theoretically maintains a value close to $1 USD. A discount from this value suggests that investors may prefer holding dollars or other more stable assets. Livio Weng, CEO of Hong Kong's cryptocurrency exchange Hashkey, pointed out that the eagerness of traders to convert assets back to Chinese yuan could infer a strategic move towards purchasing Chinese equities.\n\nOn Binance's peer-to-peer market, 1 USDT can be exchanged for between 6.78 to 6.98 yuan, while the offshore yuan to USD exchange rate has risen to around 7.09. This discount provides a potential arbitrage opportunity for investors to buy USDT with dollars, convert it to yuan, and invest in the Chinese stock market for potentially higher returns.\n\nAnnabelle Huang, managing partner at Singapore's Amber Group, observed a correlation between this phenomenon and the demand for onshore A-share trading. Brokerages in China have even extended their services during the national holiday to accommodate new account openings.\n\nThis investment interest is not limited to retail investors. Laura Vidiella del Blanco of New York-based MNNC Group noted that some institutional investors are also reallocating funds into Chinese stocks.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "China Central Bank to cut reserve ratio, inject 1 trillion Yuan to boost economyJan 24, 2024\n\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) has announced a significant reduction in the reserve requirements ratio (RRR) for all banks by 50 basis points, scheduled to take effect on February 5, 2024. However, this decisive move aims to bolster the Chinese economy amid a turbulent stock market. This bold step is set to infuse a staggering 1 trillion yuan (approximately US$140 billion) of liquidity into the market, according to a statement by PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng during a press conference held in Beijing on Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank's decision to cut the RRR is anticipated to provide a substantial boost in liquidity to the financial system. By lowering the amount of cash that banks are required to hold in reserve, this move enables financial institutions to extend loans to customers and invest in bonds, ultimately supporting economic growth. Pan Gongsheng highlighted the potential long-term benefits of this measure, which comes after two previous RRR cuts in 2023, with the most recent reduction occurring in September.\n\nMajor boost in liquidity\n\nFollowing Pan's announcement, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index experienced a notable surge, marking its most substantial two-day advance since November 2022. Additionally, the yield on China's 10-year government bonds briefly dipped before rebounding to 2.51%. The offshore yuan, amidst state-bank sales of the US dollar, managed to recover from earlier losses.\n\nWhile many economists had been anticipating an RRR cut at some point in the first quarter of 2024, some analysts view this move as a means to ensure liquidity stability in preparation for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday next month. However, the broader impact of this reduction on the economy remains uncertain.\n\nMixed reactions from experts\n\nFinancial experts have offered mixed opinions on the implications of the central bank's decision. Kevin Net, the Head of Asian Equities at Tocqueville Finance SA, noted that the RRR cut could boost market sentiment in the short term but cautioned that investors may view it as an exit opportunity unless accompanied by additional policies addressing structural issues.\n\nShen Meng, the Managing Director at Beijing-based Chanson & Co., expressed concern, suggesting that the advance announcement of an RRR cut might indicate a lack of alternative effective tools to stabilize the market.\n\nThe PBOC's move is part of a broader effort by Chinese authorities to stabilize the economy and financial markets. Premier Li Qiang had called for market stability, prompting various agencies to make promises and announcements to address the situation. These include a focus on improving the quality of listed state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and efforts to maintain the stable operation of capital markets.\n\nAdditional policy adjustments\n\nIn addition to the RRR cut, Governor Pan Gongsheng also revealed other policy adjustments. Starting January 25, 2024, the central bank will decrease re-lending and re-discount interest rates by 25 basis points specifically for small businesses and the rural sector. Furthermore, the PBOC plans to unveil adjustments to borrowing policies related to commercial property, aimed at expanding funds available to property developers and improving their liquidity conditions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Oil plunges and OPEC disappears in the face of falling battery prices: Saxo Bank's eight black swans for 2025The global economy faces an uncertain and challenging future, where unpredictable events could drastically change the rules of the game. That's why Saxo Bank's economists, true to form, have compiled a list of black swans for 2025, those outlandish predictions that, while unlikely, could cause huge disruptions in markets, politics and everyday life. This year, projections range from a second term of Donald Trump dynamiting the hegemony of the dollar to unprecedented fiscal stimulus in China. They also highlight surprising technological breakthroughs, such as the printing of a human heart or the meteoric rise of Nvidia to double the value of Apple. They also put on the table a crisis in energy prices for data centers. However, among the most striking predictions is the rise of electric vehicles, which could lead to the demise of OPEC after a sharp drop in oil prices. In addition, Saxo Bank imagines extreme weather scenarios, such as a natural catastrophe that sinks a major insurer, or an unexpected turnaround in the British economy that would return sterling to its pre-Brexit strength.\n\nThe rise of electric vehicles (EVs) is radically transforming the global energy landscape, challenging even the industry's most influential institutions, such as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, puts this black swan: the possible irrelevance of OPEC in 2025, dragged down by the accelerating shift to electrified transport and the collapse of the oil price.\n\nOil sinks and OPEC 'dies'.\n\nThe terrifying scenario for the cartel and oil plays out as follows. China has led this revolution, shattering all projections for electric vehicle adoption. In 2021, Schroders, an asset manager with nearly $1 trillion under management, projected that EV sales in China would reach 5 million by the end of 2024, with a 15% market share. However, reality far exceeded these estimates: EV registrations in China exceeded 8 million as early as 2023, and by September 2024, EVs accounted for more than 45% of new car sales in the country, with annual growth of more than 40%. This progress, which has come six years ahead of schedule, has accelerated the transition to fossil fuel-free transportation.\n\nHansen notes that, with accelerated deflation in battery prices and a tipping point in EV costs relative to internal combustion vehicles expected in less than 12 months, global oil demand shockingly peaks in 2025. Given that roughly two-thirds of oil goes into gasoline and diesel for cars and trucks, the decline in their consumption will profoundly affect OPEC's relevance. With production quotas (imposed by the cartel to keep supply tight) becoming meaningless and the most dependent members facing drastic drops in revenue, the organization could crumble in the face of internal disputes and the departure of key members. This collapse would drive a significant drop in crude oil prices, profoundly altering the global energy market balance.\n\nFor Hansen, this scenario could benefit sectors such as air transport, the chemical industry, tire manufacturers and logistics companies, which would benefit from cheaper oil. However, he also warns that the market would quickly find a new equilibrium, as higher-cost producers, such as shale oil operators in North America, would shut down operations. Meanwhile, manufacturers such as the Japanese, traditionally reluctant in the transition to electric, would be forced to hasten their strategy to avoid being left behind in this new automotive order.\n\nThus, Hansen concludes that, although the future of oil remains uncertain, the unstoppable rise of electric vehicles is not only transforming the automotive industry, but could reshape the global geopolitical and economic balance. The question that arises is not whether change will come, but how fast it will happen.\n\nTrump blowing up the dollar\n\nThe Republican candidate's arrival in the White House has always been accompanied by a strong dollar. The powerful tariffs, tax cuts and the battery of measures brought back by the New York magnate always coincide in a greater power of the 'greenback'. However, at its moment of greatest appreciation, SaxoBank believes that it could lose its global crown and explode into a thousand pieces. The reason is that the global financial stress brought about by the new 'trade wars' already seen in its first stage could finally trigger the US's biggest enemies to make good on their threat and finally find an alternative... in cryptocurrencies and gold.\n\nJohn J. Hardy, a strategist at the firm, explains in this risky forecast that the precedents with Trump are quite clear. \"In 2016 he became the first president in living memory to attack the foundations of the global system, demanding tariffs on imported goods to correct the massive errors in the U.S. trade deficit.\" In that sense, they highlighted the confrontations first with neighboring Mexico, historical partners such as Japan and, the main course, China, whose 'trade war' marked his entire term in office and led to a phase one agreement, which is still where we are now. It also launched a tariff offensive against Europe, taking advantage of the WTO ruling against Airbus subsidies.\n\nFrom SaxoBank they believe that this 2025 we will experience something even stronger, for \"if 'Trump 1.0 was the warm-up act for de-globalization, Trump 2.0 will be the main event, with all its consequences for the US dollar\". Next year the US would completely overhaul its relationship with the world \"with massive tariffs.\" The answer may be very clear: \"The implications for the US dollar are dire for trade around the world, as it cuts off the necessary supply of dollars to keep the wheels of the global dollar system moving, which ironically risks a powerful rise in the US dollar.\"\n\nHardy points out that the biggest 'rebels' against the global dominance of the greenback, the Brics, would find an alternative in \"gold-backed digital money.\" They thus point to the \"offshore yuan\", while Europe would increasingly focus on the euro. The impact would be an unprecedented explosion in the cryptocurrency market, which would become the epicenter of the rebellion against the dollar, quadrupling in value to over $10 trillion. The dollar would sink 20% against the world's major currencies and 30% against the yellow metal, which would also become one of the pillars of the new global financial system.\n\nNvidia worth twice as much as Apple\n\nSo far the story of Nvidia and the momentum that AI has generated has been one of absolute free upside. Its chips have positioned themselves as some of the most likely to become the big stars within the infrastructure underpinning this technological revolution. This is already being transferred little by little to its profits, something that has generated the company to soar 188% so far in 2024 and 848% since 2023.\n\nThese aggressive rises have given Nvidia the opportunity to remain at the gates of the global equity throne, with a capitalization of $3.395 trillion compared to Apple's $3.621 trillion. At certain times, it has even been able to surpass the firm founded by Steve Jobs and proclaim itself the most valuable company on the planet. In this sense, this fever has generated a certain vertigo among analysts who have repeatedly asked themselves whether there will be a strong correction or, at least, how far this momentum has to go, what its ceiling will be.\n\nSaxoBank's answer is that there is no ceiling and that 2025 could confirm a totally historic turn in the markets. According to Hardy Nvidia would not only overtake Apple, but could double in size, consolidating this trend and marking a true global revolution. \"In 2025, Nvidia's success will be further boosted by the volume availability of its revolutionary 208 billion transistor Blackwell chip, a chip that increases AI compute performance per unit of power consumed by up to 25 times over the previous H100 generation.\"\n\nThe analyst strategist comments that no government wants to be left behind and that the famous Blackwells are the best tool in the face of power-hungry data centers. \"There will be an insatiable demand. Not only are they (their chips) more powerful, but they consume less energy, which will make Nvidia the most profitable company of all time.\" For its part, Apple itself and other similar firms will be affected by \"the need to launch huge investments to build huge data centers and not fall out of the AI race.\" In short, Nvidia's stock will be worth at least $250 (it now trades at $138), a figure that will come \"before markets begin to question its potential to turn that promise into profits and before potential competitive scrutiny worsens its prospects.\"\n\nA 'tax' on data centers with energy skyrocketing\n\nWithin AI one of the biggest symbols has been data centers. The need to set up these logistical centers for the new world of technology is catapulting numerous sectors. Faced with the gigantic demand for energy required by giants such as Microsoft, doomed nuclear power plants such as Three Mile Island, the scene of the biggest nuclear catastrophe until Chernobyl, have been reopened. This has boosted nuclear companies such as Vistra or Constellation, which are up 300% and 116% this year. Also nineteenth-century real estate firms such as Texas Pacific land, which is up 189% after learning that it will lease land for data centers near the Permian Basin gas production sources to supply them.\n\nAll of these stories that have taken over Wall Street's Olympus coincide in situating these data centers as the epicenter of a new technological era. In that sense, Ole Hansen, head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bamk explains that he expects these 'AI bases' to consume so much energy in 2025 that they will trigger prices in the US, forcing the White House to intervene urgently with specific taxes and other measures.\n\n\"In 2025, U.S. energy prices will skyrocket in several populated areas of the country as the largest tech companies rush to secure baseload electricity supplies for their prized AI data centers,\" Hansen comments. \"This inspires popular outrage as households see their utility bills skyrocket, compounded by huge increases in the prices of electricity consumed in the home during peak load periods at night.\" Specifically, the firm openly talks about gas prices more than doubling. Something that will also ignite inflation.\n\nThe response will be clear from the US, with \"many local authorities stepping in to protect political constituents, levying huge taxes and even fines on the largest data centers in an attempt to subsidize lower energy prices for households\". For their part, these high taxes and high prices \"will incentivize investment in huge new solar farms with load-balancing battery packs, but also in dozens of new natural gas-powered power plants.\"\n\nInsurers collapse in the wake of a Katrina 2.0\n\nClimate change is advancing by leaps and bounds. Last year saw wild weather events around the world, from a deluge that created temporary lakes in some of the driest parts of the Sahara, to deadly floods in Slovakia and Poland from overflowing rivers and in Connecticut and New York after a \"once-in-a-thousand-year\" rainfall event. Saxo Bank's Saxo Bank is positing a scenario of a catastrophic storm and rainfall in the US next year that will catch the insurance industry off guard and whose damages will more than multiply the $40 billion in claims related to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nIn the aftermath of this fateful natural disaster, one of the largest US insurers was found to have significantly underestimated weather risks, resulting in undervalued policies in the affected region. With insufficient reserves to cover claims and inadequate reinsurance to mitigate the costs of this extreme event, panic would quickly spread throughout the industry. This would eventually trigger a crisis that leads to discussions at the government level on whether to bail out the failed company and the other 'wounded' in the industry to avoid widespread risk contagion. Finally, the natural disaster forces a repricing of natural catastrophes, which drastically reduces property values in many real estate markets. Consumer confidence suffers as the value of many homeowners' greatest asset, their home, becomes insecure.\n\nOne derivative of this scenario drawn by Saxo Bank strategists is that shares in Berkshire Hathaway, the famous conglomerate of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, rise as the company has enough capital to weather the panic and the firm gains market share.\n\nA boom in the pound against a sinking euro\n\nAs growth succumbs in continental Europe, dragged down by a very weak Germany and France, new fiscal policy winds are blowing in the UK. The scenario drawn in this case by Saxo Bank analysts sees the newly arrived Downing Street Labour government moving to budget measures before 2025 that avoid raising the most growth-damaging rates of income tax while cutting less productive public sector spending to reduce deficits. By cutting unproductive subsidies such as winter allowances for pensioners, encouraging investment in the real estate and manufacturing sectors and boosting the incomes of public sector workers, the UK would be setting itself up for solid nominal growth in the coming years, with the Bank of England keeping the policy rate at a high level compared to its major global peers.\n\nThe other side of the coin is being seen in the aforementioned Germany and France. In Paris, a government of circumstances with the mission of putting the accounts in order announces increases in personal income tax and corporate tax that kill growth while the feared austerity is imposed. In Berlin, despite the fact that Germany remains \"the sickest of the sick in Europe,\" in the words of Danish bank strategists, the authorities are reluctant to finance desperately needed domestic investment in housing and infrastructure with debt that they could easily afford. Its old economic model of cheap Russian energy inputs to power its huge industrial base and manufactured exports is in ruins. And its non-luxury automakers have lost competitiveness due to high energy input costs and China seizing new battery technology for electric vehicles and taking a dominant global export share in the critical auto sector.\n\nWith these macroeconomic cards on the table, sterling reaches €1.27 next year, the level at which it traded before the Brexit referendum, erasing all of its post-Brexit vote discount. Encouraging domestic investment and stronger growth prospects are not only supporting sterling against the faltering euro, but the FTSE 100, the UK's benchmark stock index, is performing well.\n\nUndue stimulus in China\n\nChina's post-pandemic weakness may end up triggering dangerous inertia on a global scale. Saxo Bank economists envisage a situation in which the Asian giant is plunged directly into a classic balance-sheet recession similar to the Japanese experience of the 1990s. The country inflated a corporate and real estate debt bubble unparalleled in world economic history and that needs to be fixed. But the solution is never pleasant.\n\nIf the debt is written off, the economy deflates and the wealthy creditor class is crushed. If nothing is done, the country can remain in a malaise that will last for decades. If massive trade surpluses are generated for other countries to finance balance sheet repair, as China is already trying to do, there is a risk of provoking the wrath of other nations and trade wars, the Danish bank's experts argue.\n\nThe scenario chosen by Beijing in this alternative reality outlined by Saxo Bank is ambitious. China is boldly betting that reflation-artificially stimulating the economy-is the only answer and believes it can manage inflationary risks, while launching a mammoth set of fiscal initiatives totaling pledges of more than 50 trillion yuan (about $7 trillion) in 2025 and beyond.\n\nMuch of the spending goes directly into consumers' pockets through the digital yuan, so it will be injected directly into the economy rather than being used to pay down debt. China also adds heavy doses of social engineering to its stimulus, incentivizing companies to reduce working hours to improve quality of life. This boosts leisure time, consumption, business formation, family formation and childbearing.\n\nThe potential market impact would be a strong reflationary shock in China and the world, outperformance of emerging markets relative to developed markets, higher global commodity prices and a stronger Chinese yuan.\n\nThe medical breakthrough (Heart printers).\n\nThe year 2025 could mark a before and after in the history of medicine with a breakthrough that seemed straight out of science fiction: the bioprinting of a fully functional human heart. According to Saxo Bank economist and strategist Koen Hoorelbeke, this scientific breakthrough, achieved through advanced technology, could be a breakthrough in the history of medicine.3D printing technology promises to transform regenerative medicine and personalized healthcare. Based on high-resolution CT scans, researchers have designed a detailed digital model of the heart that serves as a blueprint for a state-of-the-art 3D printer. This technology uses human stem cells and biodegradable materials to build the organ layer by layer with amazing precision.\n\nThe process does not end with the printing of the organ. The bioprinted heart is placed in a specialized bioreactor that simulates the physiological conditions of the human body. Over several weeks, the organ matures, developing networks of blood vessels and electrical pathways essential for its proper functioning. In an unprecedented surgical intervention, this heart is successfully transplanted into a pig, reinforcing its viability as an alternative to conventional transplants. This breakthrough could solve the global organ shortage by creating personalized hearts, compatible with each patient's DNA, thus significantly reducing the risk of rejection.\n\nThe economic and scientific implications of this achievement are extraordinary. Hoorelbeke anticipates explosive growth in the biotechnology and 3D printing sectors, with a boom in IPOs of start-ups dedicated to this technology. Furthermore, this innovation opens the door to the bioprinting of other complex organs, revolutionizing regenerative medicine and improving patient outcomes worldwide. Although we are still in the early stages of this shift, the possibility of prolonging human life through bioprinted organs not only offers hope to millions, but also promises a significant impact on the global healthcare system and the economy as a whole."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Daily Market Outlook - Wednesday, Nov. 6Nov 06, 2024\n\nImage Source: Pixabay  \n\nThe results of the US presidential election indicate that Trump will emerge victorious and the Republican Party will maintain control of the Senate. The New York Times' closely-watched 'swingometer' projected a 93% chance of Trump winning, while Treasury yields rose to four-month highs as some betting sites significantly favoured him. However, the House of Representatives is still too close to call. Four years after departing the White House, Trump has advanced to the brink of a remarkable political revival by defeating Democrat Kamala Harris in the battleground states of North Carolina, Georgia & Pennsylvania. The euro, yen, and antipodean currencies have experienced declines as a result of the 1.5% increase in the US dollar index, which is the largest increase since March 2020. The dollar's sharp increase against the offshore yuan prompted reports that Chinese banks were selling dollars to slow the yuan's decline. China is perceived as being at the forefront of tariff risk, and its currency is currently trading at a high level of uncertainty, with implied volatility against the dollar circling record highs. As investors anticipate a meeting of top policymakers in Beijing this week to sanction local government debt refinancing and spending, Chinese markets have declined from an almost one-month high.\n\nEuropean stock futures were less ebullient due to the potential for a global trade war and the threat to EU exports if Trump's tariff policies are implemented. Additionally, there was a possibility that Trump could disengage from NATO, which would necessitate an increase in defence expenditures in Europe and would also serve to strengthen Russia's territorial ambitions. Aside from US political developments, macro events that could potentially impact markets on Wednesday include: Services within the Eurozone Producer prices for September and PMIs for October. September industrial orders in Germany.

Rally looks to fizzle out today given the\nNDRC disappointment, but fundamental valuations for Chinese\nassets remain attractive. Look to see if further measures will\nbe announced later.\"\n    \nKEN CHEUNG, FX STRATEGIST, MIZUHO, HONG KONG\n\"The FX impact from the NDRC press conference disappointment was\nlargely muted, as the CNH and CNY trading was relatively stable\namid the stock market frenzy. \n    \"However, the risks to CNH are skewed to the downside due to\ncooling China market optimism and the recent USD rally. We noted\nthat the PBoC's massive easing and the positive signals from the\nPolitburo meeting have tempered bearish China growth\nexpectations, outweighing the negative impact from the US-China\ninterest rate spread widening after the PBoC's rate cut. \n    \"An underwhelming stimulus package could swiftly dampen\nbullish sentiment, giving way to the PBoC's rate cut\nmaterialising to weigh on the RMB exchange rate.\"\n    \nSEAN TEO, SALES TRADER, SAXO, SINGAPORE\n\"I believe there was significant pent-up demand for Chinese\nstocks, as evidenced by citizens lining up to open new accounts.\nHowever, while these market movements can be exciting, they are\noften not sustainable. The CSI 300 has surged approximately 38%\nover the past six days. Typically, returns on Chinese markets\naverage around 10%, so we've exceeded that by nearly four times.\n    \"The returns between Hong Kong and Chinese stocks remain\nlargely parallel, although Hong Kong is underperforming today.\nThis underperformance may be due to some investors reallocating\ntheir funds from Hong Kong to Chinese markets, where government\nstimulus is more direct. The Chinese government has a strong\ncapacity to mobilize resources, and if executed correctly, this\ncould lead to Chinese markets outperforming those of other\ncountries.\"\n    \nRONG REN GOH, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, EASTSPRING INVESTMENTS,\nSINGAPORE\n\"Markets were hoping to obtain some guidance on the size of\nfiscal stimulus at this presser – but with MoF not in\nattendance, it was unlikely this information was going to be\nprovided. Recall market estimates on stimulus ranged between CNY\n2 trillion – 10 trillion. A number closer to 10 was needed to\nsustain the risk rally.\n    \"NDRC Chairman recapped key announcements and pledges with\nno new information – disappointing the markets.\n    \"What's next? No major press briefing lined up so far. Thus,\nit is likely we see markets consolidating and digesting what has\nalready been announced, which arguably is meaningful, but not\nquite enough to satiate lofty expectations.\"\n    \nMATT SIMPSON, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, CITY INDEX, BRISBANE\n\"We're seeing a shakeout at the highs of a very strong rally.\nBut when we reach the point of a rally where my neck hurts by\nlooking at it, you could argue a pullback is overdue.\n    \"Either way, it seems some are booking profits after\nexceptional gains over gold week, and this could deter others\nfrom simply stepping in to support the market immediately. And\nthat paves the way for some chop around the top, if not a deeper\npullback for China's markets.\"\n    \nROB CARNELL, ING'S REGIONAL HEAD OF RESEARCH FOR ASIA-PACIFIC,\nSINGAPORE\n\"I think there's a lot of expectations for some further meat on\nthe bones of the physical stimulus that's been talked about a\nbit recently... talk about consumption vouchers, perhaps more\ninfrastructure spending investment.\"\n\nVASU MENON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, INVESTMENT STRATEGY, OCBC,\nSINGAPORE\n\"The strong showing today is not a big surprise as the Chinese\nbourses are probably playing catch-up after both the Hang Seng\nTech Index in Hong Kong and the Golden Dragon Index in the U.S.\nsurged by over 10% in the first week of October when Chinese\nmarkets were closed for the Golden Week holidays. \n    \"There are no clear signs that the Chinese economy is on the\nmend yet, so this rally is largely sentiment-driven and sparked\nby Beijing's stimulus blitz in late September. \n    \"Ultimately for the rally to be sustainable, we need to see\nmore fiscal policy and more measures to support the economy and\nthe property market. A great deal of hope has been built into\nthe strong rally in recent weeks and we now need to see\nadditional government policy action to support the uptrend.\"\n    \nGARY NG, SENIOR ECONOMIST, NATIXIS, HONG KONG\n\"I think the movement today basically explains that in the\nChinese onshore market, it's just rising to a level that\ninvestors are comfortable with.\n    \"Because no one is really certain about what is going on in\nthe stimulus... there could be a bit of uncertainties about\nwhether it is above or below market expectations.\"\n        \nJUN RONG YEAP, MARKET STRATEGIST, IG, SINGAPORE\n\"Mainland China stocks are largely playing catch-up, after being\nout for the Golden Week holiday over the past week. Optimism\naround recent stimulus efforts remains at play.\"\n    \nCHRISTOPHER WONG, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, OCBC, SINGAPORE \n\"So far, the NDRC press conference appears to run short on\ndetails with regards to stimulus measures. Hopes were raised but\nthe delivery was disappointing.

The franc <CHF=> weathered the\nexpected move well against a generally firmed dollar index\n<.DXY>.\n    Disinflation pressures mounted in the energy markets again\non Thursday, with crude oil prices sliding on a Financial Times\nreport that Saudi Arabia is preparing to abandon its unofficial\nprice target of $100 a barrel as it prepares to increase output.\n    U.S. crude prices <CLc1> slumped back below $70 per barrel,\nmagnifying year-on-year declines to some 25% - a likely powerful\ndownward force on headline annual inflation rates throughout\nSeptember.\n    Fed Governor Adriana Kugler kept U.S. easing hopes on the\nboil overnight too. While insisting that the inflation target\nwas not yet in the bag and further moves were \"data dependent\",\nshe added that rapid disinflation meant the Fed needed to cut\njust to keep the level of restrictiveness in policy steady.  \n    China's market revival this week also took a new leg higher,\nwith another 4%-plus leap in both mainland Chinese shares\n<.CSI300> and in Hong Kong <.HSI>.\n    Led by gains in the embattled property sector, the latest\nspur came after Beijing pledged more policy measures on growth\njust days after announcing a series of big rate cuts and funding\nfor the markets. \n    State media, citing a Politburo meeting on the economic\nsituation, reported that China would step up counter-cyclical\nadjustments of fiscal and monetary policy and strive to achieve\nfull-year economic and social development targets.\n    Reuters sources said China plans to issue special sovereign\nbonds worth about 2 trillion yuan ($284.43 billion) this year as\npart of a fresh fiscal stimulus.\n    The offshore yuan <CNH=> continued to test 7 per dollar,\nclose to its best levels since May of last year.\n    Back on Wall Street, Wednesday's stalling near record highs\nlooks set to be a temporary setback, with the tech news\novernight adding to upbeat new homes sales during the session\nthat has aided economic 'soft landing' hopes.\n     Super-sensitive soundings from the labor market are back on\nthe slate on Thursday with weekly jobless readings, and the\nAugust PCE inflation report - which Fed governor Christopher\nWaller said last week was one decisive factor in the outsize\nrate cut - is due on Friday.\n    Treasury yields held up on Thursday amid this week's series\nof auctions, with the two-year hovering around 3.55% and the\n10-year yield at 3.77%. The newly positive 2-10 year yield curve\ngap held just above 20 basis points.\n    The U.S. Congress passed a stopgap bill on Wednesday to\navert a partial government shutdown beginning next week, even as\na large number of House Republicans revolted against their\nleadership for failing to achieve new federal spending cuts.\n    The measure will maintain the government's current level of\nroughly $1.2 trillion in annual discretionary funding through\nDec. 20, avoiding the furloughing of thousands of federal\nworkers and the shutdown of a wide swath of government services\njust weeks before the Nov. 5 election.\n    U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said on Wednesday she\nwould offer tax credits to domestic manufacturers and invest in\nsectors that will \"define the next century\", as she detailed her\neconomic plan to boost the U.S. middle class.\n\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S.\nmarkets later on Thursday:\n* U.S. weekly jobless claims, August pending home sales, August\ndurables goods orders, Q2 GDP revision, Kansas City Fed Sept\nbusiness survey\n* Mexico central bank policy decision\n* Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle Bowman and Lisa Cook\nboth speak, New York Fed President John Williams, Boston Fed\nchief Susan Collins, Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari and Fed\nVice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr all speak; European\nCentral Bank President Christine Lagarde and ECB board members\nLuis de Guindos and Isabel Schnabel all speak\n* US corporate earnings: Costco, Carmax, Jabil, Accenture\n* US Treasury sells $44 billion of 7-year notes, auctions $90\nbillion of 4-week bills\n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAI frenzy boosts Micron's revenue growth    https://reut.rs/3TENzLG\nChina stocks close the yawning performance gap    https://tmsnrt.rs/3BhpQuK\nUS new home sales beat forecasts for August    https://reut.rs/3XLQOlY\nSwitzerland's inflation and interest rates    https://reut.rs/47F2N98\nBoth S&P500 and Nasdaq tracking YTD gains close to 20%    https://tmsnrt.rs/47CNMoB\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (By Mike Dolan, editing by Gareth Jones \nmike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)\n ((mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com  https://reut.rs/3xFdLhlhomsonreuters.com\n mailto:mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com; +44 207 542 8488; Reuters\nMessaging: rm://mike.dolan.reuters.com@thomsonreuters.net/))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

One Dongfeng Electronic stock can currently be bought for about CNY 9.2 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Dongfeng Electronic stocks is 553.4 mn. Dongfeng Electronic has a current market capitalization of CNY 5 bn and approximately CNY 103.3 mn worth of Dongfeng Electronic was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Dongfeng Electronic has traded 10.45 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 9.62.

Current market capitalisation for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is CNY 5.9 bn. Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion has a current price to earnings ratio of 18.89. Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Ningbo Yongxin Optics (603297.SS) traded down -2.48 % and now trades at CNY 56.33.

Current market capitalisation for Cwb Automotive Electronics is CNY 6 bn. Cwb Automotive Electronics has a current price to earnings ratio of 23.27. Title: CWB Automotive Electronics: Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain a foothold in the booming automotive electronics market may want to take a closer look at CWB Automotive Electronics Co Ltd (CWEB), a Chinese firm that has been making waves with its innovative technology solutions. Despite a lack of recent news, a technical analysis of the company's performance paints a mixed picture of its potential. Current Price and Past Performance As of September 24th, 2024, CWEB's last closed price stood at 14.9 CNY, down from its 52-week high of 24.59 CNY recorded on November 28th, 2023. However, this decline has not deterred investors, as the stock has still seen significant growth over the past year, with a 52-week range of 11.3 CNY to 24.59 CNY. This volatility suggests that the company's future performance could be influenced by various factors, including changes in consumer demand and technological advancements. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio One key metric that investors often consider when evaluating CWEB's performance is its price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio). Currently standing at 23.27, this figure indicates that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its peers, suggesting that investors have high expectations for the company's future earnings growth. Additionally, CWEB's price to book ratio (P/B ratio) of 3.28221 implies that the stock is undervalued based on its assets, which could be an attractive opportunity for value investors. Technical Indicators When examining CWEB's chart patterns, several technical indicators provide insights into the company's short-term and long-term prospects. For instance, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 61.8%, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal remains bullish, with a positive crossover hinting at continued upward momentum. However, the Stochastic Oscillator reveals that the stock is approaching overbought territory, which could lead to a correction or consolidation period in the near future. Conclusion While CWEB's recent lack of news may raise concerns among investors, a technical analysis of the company's performance highlights both positive and negative signals. With a premium P/E ratio and undervalued P/B ratio, the stock appears to be attractively priced for those willing to take on some risk. However, the stock's volatility and approach to overbought territory suggest caution may be warranted before jumping into the fray. As such, investors should carefully weigh these factors before making any decisions regarding their investment strategy.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Dongfeng Electronic\n\nDongfeng Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. is a Chinese company that specializes in manufacturing and marketing various motor vehicle parts and instruments.

The yuan was at 7.2251\nby midday, 257 pips softer than the previous late session close.\n    The sources declined to be identified because they are not\nauthorised to speak publicly about market trades.\n    The yuan has fallen more than 2% in three months, and has\nbeen pressured by growing market expectations of further\nmonetary easing to prop up the world's second-largest economy as\nwell as a weaker Japanese yen <JPY=>.  \n    Carlos Casanova, senior economist for Asia at UBP, said the\nstrengthening dollar and sharp depreciation in the yen and some\nAsian currencies after the Bank of Japan ended its negative\ninterest rate policy, have weighed on the yuan. \n    \"The market seems to have interpreted Asian currencies\nshould depreciate further against the U.S. dollar until the\nD-day of interest rate cuts by the Fed,\" he said.    \n    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China\n(PBOC) set the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan\nis allowed to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1004 per dollar, 62 pips\nweaker than the previous fix of 7.0942. \n    The Chinese central bank has for months been setting the\nrate at levels firmer than market projections, traders said. \n    Friday's midpoint was 1,143 pips firmer than a Reuters\nestimate of 7.2147, the biggest discrepancy since November.    \n    The offshore yuan <CNH=D3> meanwhile continued to weaken to\nhit a more than four-month low of 7.2525.   \n     Traders attributed sudden weakness in the yuan to rising\nmonetary easing expectations after senior PBOC officials hinted\nat there being further room to reduce bank reserve requirements.\n    China has room to further cut banks' reserve requirement\nratio (RRR), among other policy tools at its disposal, a deputy\ncentral bank head said on Thursday, underlining market\nexpectations for more easing measures to bolster the economy.\n    Ju Wang, head of Greater China FX and rates strategy at BNP\nParibas, expects the central bank's message on further monetary\neasing will cause the yuan to test lows around 7.3 again.\n    The yuan's sudden weakness weighed on stock markets too,\nwith the benchmark Shanghai stock index <.SSEC> down 1.4%.    \n    If there are signs China is allowing the yuan to depreciate\nfrom 7.2 to 7.3, \"it would definitely make it more difficult for\nthis equity rally to continue, because a lot of people would try\nto diversify into U.S. dollar exposure,\" Casanova said.\n\n (Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom and Summer Zhen; Editing by\nJacqueline Wong)\n ((summer.zhen@thomsonreuters.com; 852-3462-7739))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "July 30 (Reuters) - China's official manufacturing PMI on Wednesday is\nlikely to show a third consecutive contraction in July. With expectations low,\nthe best possible market reaction for now may be a shrug.\n    Unexpectedly swift and substantial monetary policy easing last week failed\nto cheer the stock market. Analysts expect more rate cuts ahead, likely in\nbanks' reserve requirement ratio next, but the entrenched pessimism is proving\nhard to lift. Investment bank Citi downgraded its China 2024 GDP forecast to\n4.8% from 5.0% on Monday, after second-quarter growth undershot estimates.\n    The gloom is mostly due to a still weak property sector, but also a\ndisenchantment among citizens facing employment woes. The ways to address those\nconcerns, such as cash handouts to spur consumption, still seem a step too far\nfor Beijing. \n    Even the easing of property purchasing curbs, with potentially more to come,\nhas had limited effect due to uncertainty for the future, which has also\ncurtailed demand for luxury goods.\n    If Wednesday's official manufacturing PMI comes in near the 49.3 forecast,\nfrom the previous reading of 49.5, Chinese assets will likely get sold even\nmore.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "MIL-OSI China: Flexible H2 money policy foreseenSource: China State Council Information Office\n\nChina's monetary policy is likely to stay accommodative in the second half of the year as the latest economic and financial indicators point to the need for further policy support while growing expectations of US interest rate cuts create more room for easing, market analysts said on Monday.\n\nThey said there is quite a strong possibility of cuts to both loan interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio - the amount of deposits that banks must keep as reserve - in the rest of the year.\n\nOn Monday, China unveiled its first-half economic growth figure of 5 percent year-on-year, in line with the country's GDP growth target for the full year. However, the country's second-quarter GDP growth slowed to 4.7 percent, lower than expectations and down from 5.3 percent in the first quarter.\n\nFinancial data also pointed to tepid credit demand. The increment in aggregate social financing - the total amount of financing to the real economy - stood at 18.1 trillion yuan ($2.49 trillion) in the first half, down by 3.45 trillion yuan compared with the same period last year, the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, said on Friday.\n\n\"The issue of insufficient domestic demand turned prominent in the second quarter, as residential consumption and private investment performed anemically amid a continuous adjustment of the real estate sector,\" said Wang Qing, chief macroeconomic analyst at Golden Credit Rating International.\n\n\"With that, policymakers are expected to intensify growth stabilization efforts in the second half, and there is room for cuts to both interest rates and the RRR,\" Wang said.\n\nAn improving external policy environment may also gradually expand the scope for cutting the policy benchmarks of interest rates, especially the rate of seven-day reverse repos (currently at 1.8 percent), said Ming Ming, chief economist at CITIC Securities.\n\nThe PBOC kept a policy benchmark of interest rates - the one-year medium-term lending facility rate - unchanged at 2.5 percent on Monday. This followed the offshore renminbi plumbing the 7.31 mark against the US dollar earlier this month as delayed US interest rate cuts kept the greenback strong.\n\nThe expectation of the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates within the year has grown stronger after the US consumer price index for June increased slower than expected, Ming said. \"The possibility of a reduction in loan prime rates deserves attention against this backdrop.\"\n\nThe loan prime rates are China's market-based lending rate benchmarks.\n\nThe one-year LPR has stayed unchanged since August at 3.45 percent and the over-five-year LPR stood at 3.95 percent for five consecutive months as of June.\n\nThe PBOC vowed at a meeting late last month that it will unleash the effectiveness of the LPR system and a market-based mechanism of deposit rate adjustments to reduce financing costs for enterprises and households, as part of its efforts to focus more on easing cyclical downward economic pressures.\n\nLou Feipeng, a researcher at Postal Savings Bank of China, said factors that have kept the PBOC from cutting interest rates this year include commercial banks' low net interest margin, a strong US dollar and the central bank's intention to keep long-term government bond yields from dropping too fast.\n\n\"As some of the constraints abate, the possibility of cutting the interest rates and the RRR in the third quarter is rising,\" Lou said.\n\nLou further said that if the PBOC implements an interest rate cut, it can reduce the RRR at the same time to provide long-term low-cost funding to commercial banks, which will help ease their pressures of narrowing net interest rate margins - the difference between the interest income they earn and interest they pay.\n\nMeanwhile, the new tool of overnight repos, which withdraws short-term liquidity from the banking system, can be used simultaneously to prevent an excessive supply of liquidity, he said.\n\nMIL OSI China News [http://milnz.co.nz/mil-osi-aggregation/] -\n\nCopyright 2024 Multimedia Investments Ltd, distributed by Contify.com"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Befar trades -2.1 percent lower on Tuesday 10th of SeptemberSep 10, 2024\n\nBefar (601678.SS) traded down -2.1 % during a 24 hours period ending at 04:07 AM Central Europe on Tuesday 10th. One Befar stock can currently be bought for about CNH 3.24 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Befar stocks is 2.1 bn. Befar has a current market capitalization of CNH 6.9 bn and approximately CNH 0 worth of Befar was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Befar has traded -7.65 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 3.86. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 4.93 on 09/19/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 3.26 on 09/06/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Befar\n\nHeadline: Technical Analysis: Befar Group's Mixed Q2 Results and Price Performance Investors looking to gain exposure to China's booming technology sector may want to take a closer look at Befar Group Co Ltd (BEFAR), a lesser-known but rapidly growing player in the industry. Despite mixed second-quarter results, the stock has shown resilience and could be poised for further growth. In this article, we will delve into the company's financial performance and provide a technical analysis of its assets based on the latest available data. According to the company's most recent quarterly report, Befar Group saw revenue increase by 15% year-over-year to reach $1.2 billion. However, net income declined by 22% due to higher operating expenses. The company attributed the rise in costs to increased investments in research and development, marketing, and expansion into new markets. Despite these challenges, Befar's balance sheet remains strong, with cash and equivalents standing at $345 million. Price Performance: As of September 8th, BEFAR's share price closed at 3.26 Chinese Yuan (CNH), up from its 52-week low of 3.26 CNH on September 5th. This represents a modest recovery of 0.4% over the past week. The stock's 52-week high stands at 4.93 CNH, reached on September 18th, 2023. Technical Analysis: Using the latest closing price of 3.26 CNH as our reference point, we can analyze BEFAR's technical indicators to identify potential trends and patterns. Moving Averages: * Short-term moving average (MA): The short-term MA indicates that the stock has been trading sideways over the past few days, with a slight uptrend. The 50-day MA supports this trend, suggesting that the bullish momentum may continue in the near term. * Long-term moving average (MA): The long-term MA reveals a more pronounced downtrend, which began in late July. This suggests that the stock may face resistance around the 50-day MA and potentially correct lower before continuing its upward trajectory. Relative Strength Index (RSI): * RSI (14): Currently sitting at 52.6, the RSI indicates that BEFAR is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. Bollinger Bands: * Upper band: 4.03 CNH * Lower band: 2.44 CNH The Bollinger Bands suggest that BEFAR is trading within a relatively narrow range, indicating low volatility. However, the upper band acts as a significant resistance level, and a break above it could signal a potential upswing. Conversely, a drop below the lower band could indicate a correction. Conclusion: While Befar Group's mixed Q2 results may have caused some investor hesitation, the stock's resilience and continued strength in its balance sheet suggest that there may be opportunities for growth ahead. Based on our technical analysis, the stock appears to be trading within a tight range, with potential support at the 50-day MA and resistance around the upper Bollinger Band. As such, investors considering entering or adding to their positions in BEFAR should monitor these levels closely to determine the best entry points.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Shandong Sinocera Functional Material (300285.SZ) traded down -2.58 % and now trades at CNY 14.65.

As of September 8th, the last closing price of Jiangxi Copper was 12.36 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), down from its 52-week high of 19.1 HKD recorded on May 19th, 2024. A review of the company's historical stock performance reveals that Jiangxi Copper has been trading within a relatively narrow range over the past few months. The stock experienced a significant drop in January 2024, falling from 16.3 HKD to a low of 9.95 HKD, before recovering some ground in the following months. However, the recent ore shortage has had a limited impact on the company's share price, suggesting that investors may be unfazed by the challenge. One possible reason for this lack of reaction could be the company's strong fundamentals, including a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 5.58 and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 0.52425. These ratios suggest that Jiangxi Copper's shares are undervalued compared to its peers, which could make them an attractive investment opportunity for value investors. Furthermore, the company's financial health appears robust, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.47, indicating a manageable level of borrowing. This, combined with the company's history of profitability, suggests that Jiangxi Copper is well-positioned to weather any challenges posed by the ore shortage. In conclusion, while the ongoing ore shortage may pose operational challenges for Jiangxi Copper, the company's strong fundamentals and undervalued status suggest that its shares may present an attractive investment opportunity for long-term investors.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Befar\n\nThe Befar Group Co., Ltd. is a chemical production and sales company based in Binzhou, China.

But does it change my long term view? Probably\nnot, there are a lot of structural issues, such as the\noverleveraged property sector.\"\n    While the CSI300 blue-chip index <.CSI300> and the Shanghai\nComposite Index <.SSEC> gained around 2% each, shares in Hong\nKong closed around 0.8% softer <.HSI>.\n    Property stocks, onshore and offshore, posted solid gains as\ninvestors bet the latest stimulus measures could aid China's\nbeleaguered property sector <.HSMPI> <.CSI000952>.\n    And the latest stimulus pledges prompted Goldman Sachs to\nraise its China real gross domestic product forecast for this\nyear to 4.9% from 4.7%.\n    But in a sign of the mixed response from investors, China's\noffshore yuan <CNH=D3> fell 0.3% to 7.0902 per dollar.\n    In addition, oil prices wiped out nearly all the gains made\nlast week after data showed China's inflation rate declined and\na lack of clarity on the country's economic stimulus plans\nstoked fears about fuel demand in the world's biggest crude\nimporter.\n    Brent crude futures fell $2 to $77.02 per barrel, while U.S.\nWest Texas Intermediate crude futures also fell $2, or 2.7%, to\n$73.52 per barrel.\n    In Europe, LVMH <LVMH.PA>, Hermes <HRMS.PA>, Kering\n<PRTP.PA> and other French luxury stocks exposed to China fell\nroughly between 2% and 4%.\n    \n    LACKING MOMENTUM\n    All this left MSCI's World Stock Index <.MIWD00000PUS> flat\non the day, below record highs hit last month.\n    French government bonds showed little immediate reaction to\nnews that credit ratings agency Fitch had revised France's\noutlook to \"negative\" from \"stable\" on Friday, citing increases\nin fiscal policy and political risks.\n    \"People are already negative on France, it's some positivity\nthat they are making an effort (on the deficit),\" said Kumar. \n    France's 10-year bond yield gap over benchmark Germany was\naround 77 basis points (bps), slightly tighter from Friday's\nclosing levels.\n    Germany's 10-year bond yield was steady on the day at 2.27%\n<DE10YT=RR>.\n    Currency markets, like government bonds, were largely\nsubdued.\n    The dollar drew support from reduced bets of a big Federal\nReserve interest rate cut next month <FEDWATCH>.\n    Against a basket of currencies, the greenback <=USD> was a\ntouch softer at 103.02, hovering near a recent seven-week high.\n    Traders have priced out any chance of a 50-basis-point rate\ncut from the Fed in November after data last week showed\nconsumer prices rose slightly more than expected in September\nand recent economic releases have also underscored strength in\nthe labour market. <FEDWATCH>\n    Sterling <GBP=D3> dipped 0.1% to $1.3054, with some focus in\nUK markets on an investment summit as the new Labour government\ntries to boost the country's long-term economic outlook.\n    The euro <EUR=EBS> eased just 0.08% to $1.0927 ahead of a\nlikely ECB rate cut on Thursday.\n    Konstantin Veit, a portfolio manager at PIMCO, said he\nexpected a quarter point rate cut to 3.25%. \n    Data signal a euro zone economy in worse shape than when\npolicymakers last met, boosting bets on speedier rate cuts than\nthe quarterly pace June and September reductions suggested.\n    \"While the ECB has previously been guiding towards the next\nrate cut in December, a weaker macroeconomic picture has likely\nstrengthened the Governing Council’s confidence enough to\ndeviate from the quarterly rate cut trajectory and make its\nfirst move outside a staff projection meeting,\" Veit said.\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates YTD    http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\nAsian stock markets    https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\nHang Seng Index    https://reut.rs/3Ykzh5J\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe and Alun John in London and Rae\nWee in Singapore; Editing by Christopher Cushing, Sharon\nSingleton and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)\n ((dhara.ranasinghe@thomsonreuters.com;))\n \n((To read Reuters Markets and Finance news, click on \nhttps://www.reuters.com/finance/markets\nFor the state of play of Asian stock markets please click on: <0#.INDEXA>))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Will the Market Push the Dollar Above JPY152 as Japanese Prime Minister Heads to the US?Apr 08, 2024\n\nOverview:The jump in US rates after the employment report failed to ignite a sustained rally in the dollar and this shaken the market's near-term confidence. The dollar has been mostly confined to narrow ranges and the low yielding Swiss franc and Japanese yen are softest with the G10 complex today. The dollar is knocking on JPY152. The Scandis and Antipodeans lead the advancers. The euro has made little headway despite a much stronger than expected German industrial output. Mainland China markets re-opened, and the dollar remains at the upper end of the 2% band and above it against the offshore yuan. Most emerging market currencies are softer, but the South African rand's 0.5% gain stands out, which some see as a gold play. The yellow metal reached a new record-high near $2354 today in Asia but has pulled back to about $2233.\n\nThe US 10-year yield is at a new high for the year near 4.45% and it appears to be dragging global yield higher. European benchmark yields are up 3-6 bp today. The US two-year yield is also at a new high since last November near 4.78%. Equities are mixed. Most of the large markets in Asia Pacific rose except China. Europe's Stoxx 600 is firmer after falling 0.85% before the weekend, its largest decline since mid-February. US index futures are slightly softer after the strong rally at the end of last week. May WTI gapped lower and fell to about $84.70 before recovering to almost $86.50 in Europe to close the gap, which extended to around $86.30. The Fed's Goolsbee and Kashkari speak today. The former is seen as among the more dovish and the latter, among the hawkish members.\n\nAsia Pacific\n\nChina returned from its four-day holiday weekend.With the mainland closed, the dollar remained above the onshore band against the offshore yuan. The greenback traded roughly between CNH7.24 and CNH7.2550. The upper end of the 2% band was almost CNY7.2370. China is expected to report March lending, and trade figures this week. The CPI and PPI are due early Thursday. It reported that March reserves rose to $3.245 trillion, a $19.8 bln increase. It is the most reserves since 2015. The MSCI Asia Pacific equity index was unchanged over the past two sessions when mainland markets were closed. The CSI 300 fell by almost 0.9% today.\n\nJapan's labor earnings rose by 1.8% year-over-year in February after the 2.0% pace in January was revised to 1.5%.There were sample changes and five-year benchmark adjustments. Excluding the sample changes, cash earnings rose by 1.9% (2.0% in January). Unlike in the US where average earnings growth continues to outstrip inflation, real wages in Japan have fallen year-over-year since the end of Q1 22. Prime Minister Kishida is in Washington later this week. We suspect that it would be an awkward time to intervene, even if officials wanted. With the Fed still wanting restrictive policy to moderate price pressures, intervention to weaken the dollar is unlikely to be looked at favorably in Washington.\n\nThe dollar set an 11-day low against the yen in the local session ahead of the weekend near JPY150.80 and recovered to JPY151.75 in North America.The dollar edged up a little further today and traded slightly above JPY151.90 in Europe. The dollar has held below JPY152 primarily, it would seem, out of concern material intervention. Japan does not appear to have intervened since 2022. Many observers, however, deny Beijing that same kind of influence and consistently see the large banks as acting on behalf of the officials, as if they have no commercial business or are not responding to the same sort of considerations as yen traders have shown. Even the US Treasury has cited press reports of the large banks intervening on behalf of the central bank. There are about $750 mln in options at JPY151.85 that expire today. The dollar has traded above JPY151.85 in only one session in each of the past three weeks. The Australian dollar posted what a bullish outside up week by trading on both sides of the previous week's range and settling above the high.After the US employment data, the Aussie found support near $0.6550 (slightly above the 200-day moving average) before recovering to around $0.6585. Options for about A$370 mln at $0.6580 expire today. Last week's high was near $0.6625. It is firm today in a $0.6560-$0.6590 range.Mainland China's markets re-opened from the long holiday weekend.The PBOC set the dollar's reference rate at CNY7.0947. For the last seven sessions, the fix has been between CNY7.0938 and CNY7.0949. The average in the Bloomberg survey was CNY7.2279 (CNY7.2299 before the holiday). What strikes us is not the stability of the onshore yuan, but the offshore yuan. The dollar closed at CNH7.2478 before the mainland holiday and settled last week at CNH7.2488. It is in a CNH7.2428-CNH7-2549 range, within the pre-weekend range (~CNH7.2401-CNH7.2548).\n\nEurope\n\nThe ECB meets on Thursday. It is difficult to imagine a hawkish surprise.Most likely, ECB President Lagarde continues to prepare the investors and businesses for a June cut. Last week, the final March composite PMI was reported above the 50 boom/bust level for the first time in 10 months. This supports ideas that the regional economy is bottoming, even if the upside momentum is uninspiring still especially in the core.\n\nGermany reported February industrial production today.It rose for the second consecutive month and the 2.1% gains was well above the 0.5% increase expected by the median forecast in Bloomberg's survey. Excluding energy and construction, industrial output rose 1.9% month-over-month. In January and February combined output is about 1% above the Q4 average, suggesting support for Q1 GDP. At the same time, Germany reported its February trade figures. The January trade surplus of 27.5 bln euros was a record and it slipped to about 21.4 bln euros in February. The German trade balance has recovered from the recent shocks. In 2019, Germany's average monthly trade surplus was 18.9 bln euros. In 2022, it has fallen to a 7.1 bln euro average and last year averaged 18.8 bln. Looking at the non-EU exports: Exports to Mexico have risen the most on a year-over-year basis in February and were up nearly 18%. Exports to the UK were up 9.3%, while shipments to the US increased by 5.5%. Exports to China were practically flat (0.3%). Exports to Russia were off by a little more than a fifth. They were down by nearly 11% to South Korea and about 12% lower to Brazil.\n\nThe euro fell to about $1.0790 after the US jobs data but recovered back to about $1.0845.We had suggested a solid jobs report could see $1.0780 but did not anticipate such a strong recovery. Still, the divergence between expectations for the ECB and Federal Reserve, which may be underscored this week by a firm US CPI and an ECB that is preparing the market for a June cut, seems euro negative. Speculators in the future market have culled the net long euro position from about 74.5k contracts to less than 17k in the three weeks through last Tuesday. It is the smallest since September 2022, when \"non-commercials\" were last net short euros.The euro is trading quietly today between $1.0820 and $1.0845.For its part, sterling fell to $1.2575 in response to the US employment report.We had seen potential toward $1.2580, but here, too, the strength of the recovery was unexpected. It rose to about $1.2640 and settled slightly below there. It has been confined to a narrow range so far today: $1.2615-$1.2640. Follow-through buying can lift into the $1.2680-$1.2700 area. Speculators in the future market added to the net long sterling position for the first time in three weeks, in the CFTC reporting period through April 2. Around 43.5k contracts, the net long position is nearly three times larger than at the end of last year.\n\nAmerica\n\nThe US jobs report seemed unambiguously strong.Recent reports had been marred by weakness in the household survey and downward revisions to past months' job growth. Not this time. There was a small upward revision and the household survey saw a nearly 500k employment increase, after three months of decline. The unemployment rate edged lower even though there was an increase in the participation rate (62.7% from 62.5%). Average hourly earnings eased to 4.1% from 4.3%. That is the lowest since June 2021. The average workweek increased to 34.4 hours from 34.3. With the solid labor market report in hand, attention shifts to inflation this week with the March CPI and PPI on Wednesday and Thursday. The FOMC minutes on Wednesday will draw attention. Recall that the Fed was nearly evenly split between those who saw at least three cuts this year and those who saw fewer.\n\nIn contrast, Canada's employment data disappointed.It lost a couple of thousand jobs. The median forecast in the Bloomberg survey looked for an increase of 25k. Despite a steady participation rate (65.3%), the unemployment rate rose to 6.1 % from 5.8%. It was at 5.0% last April. Wage growth (permanent employees) edged back up to 5.0% from 4.9%. The March PMI was all below the 50 boom/bust level, though ahead of the weekend, the IVEY survey rose to 57.5 from 53.9. That is the highest since last March. The Bank of Canada meets on Wednesday. The market expects it to remain on hold. The swaps market has about a 20% chance of a cut discounted. During the tightening cycle, the Bank of Canada did surprise the market, including a 100 bp hike in July 2022. The Canadian dollar fell to new lows for the year before the weekend and a surprise rate cut would likely send it lower still.\n\nThe diverging jobs report sent the Canadian dollar to new lows for the year.After repeatedly trying in recent weeks, the greenback moved above CAD1.3615 to nearly CAD1.3650. But amid the broader pullback, the US dollar returned to CAD1.3575. It is straddling CAD1.36 in about a 15-tick range on both sides. We see initial support near CAD1.3560 but are not convinced a durable high is in place. The next upside target maybe near CAD1.3700. Speculators in the futures market have not been net long Canadian dollars since last August. As of last Tuesday, their net short position of about 51.2k contracts is the largest this year.The Mexican peso rallied about 0.8% ahead of the weekend to a new nine-year high.For attractive carry it is not just against the US dollar, but the Swiss franc, Japanese yen, and offshore yuan too. Momentum and trend followers, whose timeframe may not be sufficient to draw much carry, also seem to be participating. Speculators in the futures market have the largest net long peso position in four years (almost 134k contracts). Yesterday's first TV debate between the presidential candidate appears to be having little market impact, leaving the dollar in a narrow range today: MXN16.45-MXN16.4950. Initial resistance is seen MXN16.50-MXN16.52.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Trump's proposed tariff and tax\npolicies are seen as inflationary and therefore likely to keep\nU.S. interest rates high and undermine currencies of trading\npartners.\n    During Trump's first presidency, the yuan weakened about 5%\nagainst the dollar during the initial round of U.S. tariffs on\nChinese goods in 2018, and fell another 1.5% a year later when\ntrade tensions escalated.\n    \"We don't think China policymakers would react to\ngeneralized pre-election candidate talk about tariffs before\nthey actually materialize,\" Citi analysts said in a note.\n    \"Under a potential 60% tariff, if the yuan exchange rate\nfollows the path in the last round, it could go to 7.7-8.0.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "HONG KONG, Aug 9 (LPC) – Offshore renminbi, or Dim Sum, financings are\ncontinuing to find appeal among Chinese borrowers tapping the Hong Kong loan\nmarket thanks to a persistent divergence in the direction of interest rates\nbetween China and the US.\n\nAt least three Chinese borrowers are raising loans carrying offshore renminbi\ntranches, including a US$5.5bn-equivalent refinancing for Ant Group, a\nborrowing of up to US$650m for state-owned supply chain services provider\nXiamen Xiangyu Group, and a Rmb1.5bn-equivalent (US$209m) financing for miner\nSinomine Resources Group.\n\nThese will add to the US$1.84bn-equivalent in Dim Sum loans already completed\nso far this year, which represents 9.1% of the total loan volume of US$20.14bn\nraised by Chinese corporates in Hong Kong. This compares to the 3.7% market\nshare that Dim Sum loans recorded in 2023, according to LSEG LPC data.\n\nMeanwhile, Indonesian courier services provider J&T Global Express and Hong\nKong-based United Asia Finance are in the market for a US$1bn-equivalent loan\nand a HK$2bn-equivalent (US$256m) facility, respectively, that also carries\noffshore renminbi tranches.\n\n“Offshore renminbi loans remain an attractive option for borrowers as the\ncost of US dollar-denominated financing remains high,” said Phyllis Ng, head\nof loan syndication at China Construction Bank (Asia). “This is a trend that\nis expected to continue growing until we start to see meaningful interest rate\ncuts in the US.”\n\nLast year, offshore renminbi loans totalled US$2.22bn-equivalent, against the\nUS$59.47bn in total loan volumes raised by Chinese borrowers in Hong Kong.\nThis already represented a significant jump from the US$138m-equivalent raised\nthrough such transactions in 2022.\n\nAs the gap between the costs of borrowing in the Chinese currency and the\ngreenback remains wide, borrowers with international funding needs are\nincreasingly leaning on the Dim Sum market compared to raising loans in US\ndollars. And even though the cost of offshore renminbi borrowing may be higher\nthan onshore levels, corporates with overseas funding needs are willing to pay\nthe premium due to the flexibility and convenience it offers.\n\nBorrowers in US dollars or offshore renminbi pay spreads over the respective\nthree-month US dollar SOFR and CNH Hibor rates of 5.36% and 2.57%, but onshore\ntop-tier borrowers can pay less than the one-year loan prime rate of 3.35%. In\nthe past 12 months the SOFR rate has risen by 24bp while the CNH Hibor rate\nhas been hovering around 2.5%–3.5%, after peaking at 4.48% in September 2023\nand 4.54% in April 2024. Over that period the LPR has come down by 20bp.\nChanging structures\nThe growth of Dim Sum loans in the syndicated loan market over the past year\nhas also encouraged innovative structuring and pricing approaches as borrowers\nand lenders look to achieve common ground.\n\nSome banks in Hong Kong prefer CNH Hibor as the benchmark as it better\nreflects their costs of funding, while some borrowers prefer using fixed\ninterest rates to avoid potential fluctuations in CNH Hibor, according to\nanother senior Hong Kong-based loan banker. Interest margins below the\none-year LPR are considered too tight for many banks, and with the People’s\nBank of China likely to cut the LPR further, some lenders are opting to offer\nfixed-rate loans to ensure more stability and predictability in their interest\nincome.\n\nAmong the deals in syndication, the three-year term loan for Sinomine\nResources offers a fixed interest rate of 3.9%. Ant Group is offering an\ninterest margin of 88bp over SOFR/CNH Hibor for its latest US$5.5bn-equivalent\nthree-year refinancing, while Xiamen Xiangyu’s three-year borrowing carries\nmargins of 135bp over SOFR for commitments in US dollars, and 120bp over CNH\nHibor or 10bp over one-year LPR for commitments in offshore renminbi.\n\n“The pricing on these deals really comes down to the bargaining power of the\nborrowers,” the banker said. “Stronger borrowers are often able to dictate\nthe specific pricing benchmarks they want to use. Meanwhile, some other\nborrowers opt to structure their deals with multiple pricing options in order\nto access the widest pool of liquidity from different lenders.”\nQuota preservation\nDim Sum loans help borrowers manage foreign exchange risks while using up\ntheir offshore borrowing quotas, which Chinese regulators might not renew if\nthey are not used.\n\n“While onshore loans may offer lower pricing, borrowers consider other\nfactors such as the flexibility of raising offshore loans in terms of the use\nof proceeds for overseas projects, the importance of maintaining their\noffshore borrowing limits as well as relationships with overseas banks,”\nsaid CCB (Asia)'s Ng.\n\nFor lenders, offshore renminbi loans present opportunities to deploy capital\namid a dearth of deal flow in Hong Kong as well as intense competition from\nChina’s domestic loan market.\n\nOverall lending opportunities are on the decline as a prolonged debt crisis in\nChina’s real estate sector as well as a slower-than-expected economic\nrecovery has hurt demand for credit. US dollar fundraising activity for China\nInc in Hong Kong, traditionally the offshore funding centre for Chinese\nborrowers, plunged 37% year on year to US$10.16bn in the first half of 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, the liquidity pool for offshore renminbi in Hong Kong\nremains strong. As at the end of June, renminbi-denominated deposits in Hong\nKong totalled Rmb1.06trn, compared with Rmb907.3bn a year earlier, according\nto the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\n((Apple Li: +852 3853 4367, apple.li@lseg.com, Twitter: @LPCLoans))\n\n(Editing by Prakash Chakravarti)\n\n\n\n(c) Copyright Refinitiv"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

Current market capitalisation for Guobo Electronics is CNY 30.4 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Guobo Electronics is 54.46. Title: Technical Analysis: Guobo Electronics' Mixed Signals Amidst Lack of Recent News Introduction: In the absence of recent news, we turn our attention to the technical analysis of Guobo Electronics Co Ltd (GBOE), a Chinese electronics manufacturer. Despite the lack of updates, GBOE's stock performance has been sending mixed signals, with fluctuations in both its short-term and long-term trends. In this article, we will delve into the company's current and past prices, price ratios, and other key indicators to provide a comprehensive assessment of its technical standing. Current Price Trend: As of October 13th, 2024, GBOE's last closing price was 49.47 CNY, representing a slight increase compared to its previous close. However, this upward movement seems to have stalled, as the stock has failed to breach the 50 CNY mark despite several attempts. This suggests that buyers may be losing steam or that sellers are exerting pressure to keep the price down. Past Performance: Looking back at GBOE's historical data, we can see that the stock experienced significant growth during the latter half of 2023, peaking at 60.4631 CNY on November 20th. Since then, the price has been trending downwards, reaching a low of 32.13 CNY on September 17th. This sharp decline could be attributed to various factors such as market volatility, industry competition, or potential changes in the company's financial health. Price Ratios: At present, GBOE's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 39.33, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 39 times the company's earnings per share. Meanwhile, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio is 4.57784, suggesting that the stock is trading at a premium relative to its book value. These ratios suggest that investors have a positive outlook on the company's future prospects but may also be factoring in some degree of risk. 1. Moving Averages: GBOE's short-term moving average (MA) is currently positioned above its long-term MA, indicating a bullish crossover. However, the gap between the two averages is narrowing, which could signal a possible reversal in the near future. 2. Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI reading of 52.6 indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral sentiment among investors. 3. Bollinger Bands: The stock's Bollinger Bands are contracting, indicating decreased volatility and potentially a more stable price trend. Conclusion: While there appears to be a lack of recent news driving Guobo Electronics' stock performance, technical analysis reveals a mix of positive and negative signs. The stock's inability to break through the 50 CNY barrier and the narrowing gap between its short-term and long-term moving averages suggest caution among investors. However, the P/E and P/B ratios indicate continued optimism regarding the company's future prospects. As such, further monitoring of GBOE's performance and any subsequent news developments will be crucial in determining the best course of action for investors.\n\n- Wintime Energy (600157.SS) traded down -4.41 % and now trades at CNH 1.31.

Wintime Energy Group Co Ltd: Technical Analysis As of October 11th, 2024, there have been no recent updates on Wintime Energy's performance. However, we can analyze the company's previous activity based on available data. On August 12th, 2024, TerraCom (ASX:TER) and Wintime Energy announced their collaboration to develop the Moorlands Coal Project. This partnership could potentially boost Wintime Energy's growth prospects, but there has been no further news since then. Looking at Wintime Energy's historical stock prices, we can see that the highest point over the past 52 weeks was 1.48 CNY on November 27th, 2023, while the lowest point was 1.01 CNY on July 23rd, 2024.

While there may be potential for growth due to the company's partnership with TerraCom, investors should exercise caution before making any decisions without additional updates on the company's progress.\n\n- Shanghai M&g Stationery (603899.SS) traded down -2.86 % and now trades at CNH 31.61. Shanghai M&g Stationery has a market capitalisation of CNH 30.3 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Shanghai M&g Stationery is 19.5.

Shanghai M&G Stationery's recent performance has been mixed, with the stock experiencing both gains and losses over the past year. However, the company's strong fundamentals and commitment to sustainability suggest that it may be poised for long-term growth. The stock's relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at 52.67, indicating that it is neither oversold nor overbought. Additionally, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator suggests that the stock may be due for an upswing, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line. However, investors should note that the stock's beta rating is relatively high at 1.73, which means that it may be more volatile than the broader market. As such, risk-averse investors may want to approach this stock with caution. Conclusion: Shanghai M&G Stationery's partnership with the Boao Forum for Asia highlights the company's commitment to sustainability and its position as a leader in the stationery industry. While the stock's recent performance has been mixed, its strong fundamentals and potential for long-term growth make it an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Guangzhou Port\n\nThe Guangzhou Port Company Limited offers a range of services including loading, discharging, storing, bonded warehousing, logistics, and other port services.

According to data from finanzen.net, the last known news about Bank of Jiangsu dates back to August 18th, with the stock closing at 7.53 CNY. While there has been no recent news, investors can still gain valuable insights from the company's quarterly results.

As of September 21st, 2024, CEBK's last closed price stood at $2.31, representing a modest increase from its 52-week low of $2.13 recorded on January 21st, 2024. However, the stock has yet to reach its 52-week high of $2.64, which was achieved on May 19th, 2024. This suggests that while the company has made progress, there may still be room for growth. One key metric that investors may find particularly interesting is CEBK's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, currently standing at 3.34. This indicates that the market is valuing each dollar of the company's earnings at approximately three dollars and thirty-four cents. While this may seem relatively high, it is important to note that CEBK's earnings have been steadily increasing over time, suggesting that the company's financial health is strong. Another metric worth considering is CEBK's price-to-book (P/B) ratio, which stands at 0.293665. This indicates that the market values the company's assets at approximately twenty-nine percent of its book value. Again, while this may seem low compared to other companies in the industry, it is important to remember that CEBK has been consistently profitable and has demonstrated steady growth. Overall, while there may not be any immediate news driving CEBK's stock price, the company's historical performance and fundamental metrics suggest that it could be a promising long-term investment opportunity. As such, investors may want to keep a watchful eye on CEBK's future developments and consider adding it to their portfolios if they haven't already done so.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout China Three Gorges Renewables\n\nChina Three Gorges Renewables Group Co.,Ltd. is a utility company operating in the renewable energy generation sector.

The\nmarket's focus will be on any hints of the central bank's rate\npath outlook.\n    Sterling <GBP=D3> was up 0.12% at $1.2766.  \n    The Swiss franc <CHF=EBS> was nearly flat at 0.88375 per\ndollar, with markets weighing the prospect of a half-point rate\ncut by the Swiss National Bank on Thursday.\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates    https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Brigid Riley; Editing by Saad Sayeed and Jamie\nFreed)\n ((mailto:brigid.riley@thomsonreuters.com;))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

The shortfall amounted to 6.4% of gross\ndomestic product, up from 6.2% a year earlier.\n    A fiscal think-tank, the Committee for a Responsible Federal\nBudget, recently estimated that Republican Donald Trump's plans\nwould pile up $7.5 trillion in new debt, more than twice the\n$3.5 trillion envisaged in Democrat Kamala Harris's proposals.\n    Shifting odds on post-election Congressional math, however,\nmay have much to do with how any of those fiscal plans pan out. \n    At 4.12%, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields <US10YT=RR> hovered\nclose to 2-1/2 month highs on Monday even with another\nquarter-point Federal Reserve interest rate cut still near fully\npriced for next month.\n    With the Atlanta Fed's real-rime \"GDPNow\" model indicating\ngrowth in excess of 3.4% and U.S. economic surprise index at its\nmost positive in six months, the early Q3 earnings season is\nimpressing again with 83% of the 71 S&P500 firms reported \nbeating forecasts.\n    While the blended annual profit growth estimate for the 500\nhas dipped to 4% from the 5% expected pre-season, according to\nLSEG data, revenue growth is holding to expectations and a\nreturn to brisk double-digit earnings expansions is still\nforecast for next quarter and right through next year.\n    A heavy diary of updates this week spans industrial,\ndefence, energy and financial sectors but Tesla's quarterly\n<TSLA.O> likely grabs many headlines mid-week.\n    Overseas, attention was back on China on Monday as the\nlatest official lending rate cuts there were mostly expected and\nmet with a shrug by markets. The one-year loan prime rate\n<CNYLPR1Y=CFXS> was lowered by 25 basis points to 3.10% from\n3.35%, while the five-year LPR <CNYLPR5Y=CFXS> was cut by the\nsame margin to 3.6% from 3.85% previously.\n    Even though Chinese GDP and industrial data released on\nFriday were marginally ahead of forecasts, the historic slowdown\nremains in train and the property bust continues. China's new\nhome prices fell at the fastest pace since May, 2015. \n    China's mainland shares <.CSI300> eked out a small gain on\nMonday, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng <.HSI> lost more than 1%.

Yet Beijing is probably not done.\n    Chinese stocks and the yuan continued to surge Wednesday, after Tuesday's\nunveiling of a wide swathe of economic stimulus measures. The offshore yuan\nextended its rally past the 7.0000 watermark to reach a new 16-month high of\n6.9952. The Shanghai composite stock index surged 2.4% while Hong Kong's Hang\nSeng sprinted 2.3% higher.\n    The People's Bank of China delivered on its promise to cut rates, starting\nwith a 30 basis-point easing of the one-year medium-term lending facility rate\nto 2.00%, as signalled on Tuesday. The seven-day reverse repo rate, earmarked to\nbe trimmed by 20 bps to 1.50%, is likely next.\n    Still on the cards is a planned 50 bps slashing of banks' reserve\nrequirement ratio, as well as a cut in the benchmark one-year and five-year loan\nprime rates; the latter affects household mortgages. \n    And there could be more in store beyond the telegraphed monetary policy\neasing moves. Tuesday's coordinated announcement of the economic boosters\nsuggests policymakers' sense of urgency has risen another notch or three.\n     While Beijing has acted judiciously to lower lending costs, support\nproperty markets, reduce mortgage burdens, and to juice the equity markets,\nthere are a couple of major issues to address before naysayers will relent. \n    First, consumer confidence, which might pick up if property prices finally\nturn a corner, possibly via a knock-on effect from a sustained rally in\nequities. Second, joblessness, particularly among the youth, needs to be\nremedied.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Preparing for US inflation aftershockOn February 14, the US experienced an unexpected inflation shock, causing a surge in bond yields, pushing expectations of the first Fed rate cut out to June, and boosting the dollar. The MSCI Asia ex-Japan index is down four days in a row, with the MSCI World index slumping 1.4% for its steepest decline since September. The big three U.S. indices lost between 1.3% and 1.8%. \n\n The regional calendar on Wednesday is light, with wholesale price inflation in India and presidential elections in Indonesia being the main events. Chinese markets are still closed for Lunar New Year, although the offshore yuan could sell off. This presents a potentially choppy mix of political risk, below-average liquidity, and widespread 'risk off' sentiment across Asia following the tightening of financial conditions and big moves across many markets on Tuesday. \n\n U.S. Treasury yields jumped as much as 20 basis points after figures showed that annual U.S. CPI inflation slowed to 3.1% in January and not the 2.9% economists had expected. Stocks tumbled. The reaction of Japanese stocks will be particularly interesting after the dollar smashed through the psychologically important 150.00 yen barrier to trade within sight of the all-time high of just under 152.00 yen reached in November last year and October 2022. \n\n The Nikkei played catch up on Tuesday, surging nearly 3% for its best day since November 2022. However, the weak yen might take a back seat to Tuesday's global equity selloff. India's wholesale price index rose 0.53% year-on-year in January, with strong gains in food prices offset by fuel deflation. Another weak print on Wednesday could put the rupee under added downward pressure. \n\n The Indonesian rupiah may be sensitive to domestic politics as the country goes to the polls.

This\ntime President Xi Jinping is better prepared for a fight, even as he has more\nto lose.\n\nTrump, who won a second term as president in an election on Tuesday, has\nthreatened to put tariffs of as much as 60% on Chinese goods, a level that\nBloomberg Economics says will decimate trade between the world's biggest\neconomies. That's on top of a range of export controls on advanced technology\nthat the Biden administration has only tightened since Trump left office.\n\nDuring this period, China has taken strategic steps to ensure it's more\nresilient and well-positioned to strike back. Key to that has been expanding\nits toolkit, which now includes export controls on critical raw materials,\ntariffs on agricultural goods and an entity list that can target key American\ncompanies.\n\n\"China, psychologically speaking, is much more prepared in dealing with him\nagain,\" said Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the People's Liberation Army\nand senior fellow at Tsinghua University's Centre for International Security\nand Strategy. China's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday congratulated Trump on his\nelection victory, saying it respects the choice of Americans.\n\nStill, Xi would much prefer to avoid a tariff battle that risks proving much\nmore devastating than the first round. China has relied on exports of goods\nlike electric vehicles and batteries to buoy an economy beset by deflationary\npressure and property woes, and Chinese lawmakers are meeting this week to\nformulate measures to bolster growth.\n\nIf Trump follows through on his tariff threats, Chinese authorities will need\nto do much more to help the economy. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said last week\nthat steeper trade restrictions on China may force Xi's hand to bolster\ndomestic consumption, something the Communist Party has traditionally sought\nto avoid.\n\nThe yuan on Wednesday weakened the most in two years and Chinese stocks fell,\ngiving investors a taste of the volatility that lies ahead as Trump clinches\nthe US presidency. The offshore yuan fell as much as 1.3% against the dollar,\nthe largest one-day drop since October 2022. Chinese shares listed in Hong\nKong bore the brunt of the selling, with a Hang Seng gauge closing 2.6% lower.\n\n\"China can hardly retaliate on 60% tariffs,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, Asia\nPacific chief economist at Natixis SA. \"What China will do is to announce a\nbigger stimulus to counteract so that the market doesn't penalize China.\"\n\nDuring Trump's first term, roughly two years of threats, tariffs and talks\nended with a deal signed in January 2020 that included a promise by China to\nbuy $200 billion worth of American goods to try and close its trade imbalance\nwith the US. However, the outbreak of Covid around the same time quickly\nsoured relations between the countries, and China never came close to\nachieving the targets as Chinese exports soared during the pandemic.\n\nA renewed trade war threatens to do greater damage to global trade. Last year,\nChinese companies exported $500 billion in goods to the US, or about 15% of\nthe value of all its exports. If the US were to put high tariffs on all or\nmuch of those products, it could wipe out those sales and further hurt firms\nfacing a weak domestic economy and falling prices.\n\nWhile Chinese officials don't want to overreact to Trump's new tariff threats,\nthey are also wary of looking weak, according to Scott Kennedy, a senior\nadviser at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International\nStudies, who frequently travels to China. Potential options for Xi's\ngovernment, he said, include targeting American companies with sizable\ninterests in China, selling US treasuries, devaluing the yuan and doing more\noutreach in Europe and Latin America.\n\n\"They're sick of being treated like a piñata and want to fight back,\" Kennedy\nsaid of China. \"They're prepared to deal with Trump and fight fire with fire\nif needed.\"\n\nOne wild card for China is the emergence of Elon Musk as a major supporter of\nTrump's campaign for president. The billionaire chief executive officer of\nTesla Inc. has extensive business interests in China, raising the possibility\nthat he could advocate a softer approach. Trump praised Musk while declaring\nvictory in the early morning hours of Wednesday in the US.\n\nBut if a trade war does erupt, China will be ready to hit back - and US\nexports of agricultural goods may again be the first target. Since Trump's\nfirst term, Brazil has strengthened its position as the largest soybean\nsupplier to China, and is now also the biggest source of corn imports,\nreplacing the big spike of US exports to China as part of the 2020 trade deal.\nIn 2016, the US supplied more than 40% of Chinese soybean imports, but that\nhad fallen to less than 18% in the first nine months of this year.\n\nChina's slowing economy also provides Beijing with more of a buffer, as its\ndemand for pork - as well as corn and soybeans to feed pigs - has slumped.\nThat means it's less reliant on imports and can more easily shift purchases\nfrom the US to other nations.\n\n\"There should not be any doubt about China's tit-for-tat retaliation,\" said\nZhou Xiaoming, a researcher at a Beijing think-tank and a former deputy\nrepresentative to China's United Nations mission in Geneva a decade ago. \"Easy\ntargets include corn and soya beans. The country is in a better position than\n2018 to take counter measures as China has developed Brazil as a reliable\nalternative source of supplies and been able to reduce imports from the US.\"\n\nAt the same time, however, China has fewer obvious targets to hit. The\ncountry's imports from the US have fallen from a peak in 2021, and Beijing\nhasn't signed a contract to buy new Boeing Co. jets for years, meaning it has\none less threat it can make. In addition to a weakening trade relationship,\ndirect investment ties between the US and China are also shrinking: The stock\nof Chinese investment in the US last year was down by 28% from the peak in\n2019, according to United Nations data.\n\nThat raises the possibility that China may seek to devalue its currency,\nmaking exports cheaper. While China's last formal devaluation was in 2015,\nduring the thick of the first trade spat from mid-2018 to mid-2019 authorities\nallowed the yuan to fall to almost 7.2 to the dollar, making its exports\ncheaper and providing some cushion to Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe Chinese currency is currently around the same level, but allowing it to\ndrop a lot further risks irking other trading partners around the world, who\nmight in turn put their own tariffs on Chinese goods. A flood of cheap steel\nhas already prompted nations to raise barriers to the metal, and that could\nspread to more products in a general trade war.\n\nOne major new tool for Xi is export controls, which the US has deployed\nfrequently against China. Last year, Beijing restricted overseas sales of\ngallium and germanium, two metals which are widely used across chipmaking,\ncommunications equipment and defense industries. China may now seek to impose\ncurbs on critical raw materials the US needs for strategic technologies, such\nas antimony, which is used in some semiconductor devices.\n\nChina also now has a more formal process for sanctioning foreign firms.\nAuthorities in September said China would begin a probe of PVH Corp., the\nparent company of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, for not using cotton from\nthe far west region of Xinjiang, where the US restricted trade due to human\nrights concerns. Beijing has also sanctioned a US drone firm for supplying\nTaiwan, blocking it from purchasing parts in China, according to the Financial\nTimes.\n\nUltimately, China would prefer to strike a deal with Trump. The incoming\npresident has signaled that he would be open to Chinese investment in the US,\nwhich could potentially form the basis for some sort of agreement, according\nto Henry Wang Huiyao, founder of the Center for China and Globalization\nresearch group in Beijing.\n\n\"Trump is a pragmatic politician who focuses on solving specific problems,\"\nWang said. \"China has the super lead on electric vehicles and green\ntechnology,\" he added. \"There's an enormous opportunity that Chinese companies\ncan help make America great again.\"\n\nStill, there's a recognition in Beijing that China must hope for the best and\nprepare for the worst. And there's not a whole lot of options if Trump wants\nto make good on extreme threats that would also hurt the US and raise prices\nfor American consumers.\n\n\"We've talked a lot about what China can do to prepare for this scenario, but\nin the end there isn't really too much that can be prepared,\" said Tu Xinquan,\na former adviser to China's Commerce Ministry who is now professor and dean of\nthe China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International\nBusiness and Economics in Beijing.\n\n\"There's no silver bullet,\" he added. \"We can only deal with the problem when\nit comes.\" Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.\nFor any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement,\nplease contact Editor at contentservices@htdigital.in"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

Weakening\nthe exchange rate, given that sort of backdrop, does have a very\nappealing logic to it. \n    And we know, of course, that politically, particularly if\nChina does want to increase the reserve status of the renminbi,\nthere is pressure on it to keep it firmer. But if they need to\nrevitalise the economy, and they tend to be more interested on\nfocusing on exports, there is quite a compelling logic that they\nmay allow the renminbi to soften.\"\n        \n  \n    NICHOLAS REES, SENIOR FX MARKET ANALYST, MONEX, LONDON:\n    \"News that China will allow the yuan to weaken as they\nprepare for Trump tariffs does not come as a shock – this has\nbeen one of our high-conviction calls post-election day. \n    \"As we see it, Chinese authorities understand that they need\nto establish a negotiating position, and that right now they\nhave first mover advantage. If anything, we think markets are\nstill underestimating the degree to which the yuan could weaken\nin the next year if tariffs are implemented. But, given the\nyuan’s role as a regional FX anchor, significant depreciation is\nlikely to have broader knock-on effects, particularly across\nAsian FX\"\n \n    CHRIS SCICLUNA, HEAD OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH, DAIWA CAPITAL\nMARKETS, LONDON:        \n    \"Most people would assume that the response to implementing\ntariffs would be to allow the yuan to weaken. Even if European\nexports are hit (by tariffs), the markets will react by\nweakening the euro. \n    \"So, it's about if and when. The currency adjustment might\noffset the impact of tariffs.\n    \"There is a question about whether or not a weaker yuan is\nappropriate given the performance of Chinese exports, which are\nstrong while imports are weak. The appropriate response to that\nis not a weaker currency.\n    \"But if you have additional tariffs from the U.S., then we\nwill get a weaker yuan. Then the U.S. will have to ask the\nquestion of whether it's worth it.\"\n    \n    FRED NEUMANN, CHIEF ASIA ECONOMIST, HSBC, HONG KONG:\n    \"Currency adjustments are on the table as a tool to be used\nto mitigate the effects of tariffs. I think that is clear.\n    \"It's tempting to think that Chinese currency weakness could\nfully offset the tariffs in the U.S. and kind of neutralise the\nimpact on the economy. But I think that would be short-sighted.\n    \"The Chinese leadership is likely also to be mindful about\nthe impact of a weaker Chinese currency on other trading\npartners.\n    \"If China takes the currency aggressively lower, it raises\nthe risk of a tariff cascade ... so I think there is a bit of a\nrisk here that if China uses its currency angle too\naggressively, it could lead to a backlash among other trading\npartners and that's not in the interest of China.\"\n    \n    MATT SIMPSON, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, CITY INDEX, BRISBANE:\n    \"China recently said that nobody wins in a race to the\nbottom, but that doesn't mean they're not prepared to play\nalong.

We don’t expect an\nintentional and sharp depreciation like this...rapid movement\nabandoning the currency stability objective would also unwind\nthe progress made over the last few years on maintaining Chinese\npurchasing power, reducing capital outflow pressure, and\nimproving the RMB’s role as a settlement currency.\"\n    \n    JIN MOTEKI, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, NOMURA SECURITIES, TOKYO:\n    \"Even if the Chinese yuan depreciates to some extent because\nof Trump's tariffs, I think the yen is unlikely to move in the\nsame direction.\n    \"I think maybe if the Chinese government allows yuan to\ndepreciate, it will support Chinese exports.

Talks are already\nunderway, as some member nations bolster bilateral ties to attract fresh\ninvestment from China.\n    For Beijing, weaker trade ties with the U.S., but stronger ones with the\nrest of the world would certainly help its yuan internationalisation goal. \n    The yuan's trade-weighted index may remain steady despite the dollar's surge\nthis week. Its relative moves against the yen, euro, and other Asia currencies,\nwhich all tumbled after Trump's victory, have been tame. Investors could\neventually see the yuan as a medium-term haven, provided China assures them it\nwon't devalue the currency to counter U.S. trade tariffs.\n    For more click on [FXBUZ] \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nRMBindex:     https://tmsnrt.rs/3YUCh9b\nUSD:     https://tmsnrt.rs/3CvdjEo\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Ewen Chew is a Reuters market analyst.

The 89-94 easing cycle saw the dollar peak a little over a week after\nthe first rate cut. The 94/95 tightening cycle was followed by 3 rate cuts in\n95/96 and the dollar kept on climbing until 1998. The dollar recovered before\nthe Fed tightened in 99 and was falling by the time the Fed cut rates in\nDecember 2000, but recovered to a new high in 2001, and didn't really trend\nlower until 2002.\n    The Fed then hiked rates between 2004 and 2006, before starting the next\neasing cycle in 2007, by which time the dollar was already in free fall. The\nfinal easing cycle (to date) started in July 2019. The dollar fell after the\nsecond and third hikes in that series, in late 2019, rallied in early 2020 and\nspiked when COVID struck, and then fell back after the Fed's introduction of a\nbarrage of measures to prop up the global financial system.\n    Juckes concludes that the U.S. dollar's two big falls, in 1985-87 and\n2001-08 were a lagged response to Fed easing; 2008 was chaotic and the smaller\neasing cycles are much more mixed in their impact. \n    If there is a median outcome, it is a lagged reaction to Fed easing, but a\nvery limited easing cycle doesn't necessarily send the dollar significantly\nlower.   \n\n    \n    \n    \n     \n    For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nUSD vs Fed funds    https://tmsnrt.rs/3zJVErl\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "(Updates prices, adds quote)\n    By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed, Suzanne McGee and Rae Wee\n       NEW YORK, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Investors scrambled to\nshift their positioning on Wednesday following a closely-watched\ndebate between Republican Donald Trump and Democratic Vice\nPresident Kamala Harris, as betting markets swung in Harris’\nfavor after the event.\n    Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, the company that\nowns Truth Social, fell 13% on Wednesday afternoon, while other\nso-called Trump trades such as bitcoin and crypto stocks\nretreated. Solar stocks, seen as benefiting from a Harris win,\nrallied and healthcare shares fell. \n    In a combative debate late Tuesday, Trump and Harris clashed\nover everything from the economy to immigration, as each sought\na campaign-altering moment in what has been a closely-fought\nrace. \n    Their exchanges left investors with few new details on\nissues that could sway markets, including tariffs, taxes and\nregulation. But online prediction markets showed bets on a\nstronger likelihood of a Harris win in November: Harris’ odds in\nPredictIt’s 2024 presidential general election market improved\nto 55 cents from 53 cents before the debate, while Trump’s odds\nslipped to 47 cents from 52 cents. \n    There is a “general view that Harris won the debate,” said\nAlvin Tan, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in\nSingapore. “It's obviously not a slam dunk for Harris, but the\nchances of a Trump victory have slipped a bit.\"\n   \n\n    While the presidential race is very much on investors’\nminds, political concerns have lately coalesced with more\nimmediate market catalysts, including worries over a potentially\nsoftening U.S. economy and uncertainty over how deeply the Fed\nwill need to cut interest rates. The S&P 500 notched its worst\nweekly percentage loss since March 2023 last week after a\nsecond-straight underwhelming jobs report, though the index is\nstill up around 15% this year.\n    Still, some investors believe even a small shift in\nperceptions of the candidates could prove significant in a\ncontest that could come down to tens of thousands of votes in a\nhandful of states. The candidates are effectively tied in the\nseven battleground states likely to decide the election,\naccording to polling averages compiled by the New York Times.\n    \"The US Presidential debate achieved its goal by providing a\ndecisive edge to one of the candidates in what has been an\nexceptionally close race,\" said Charu Chanana, Head of FX\nStrategy and Global Market Strategist at Saxo. \"Crypto and\nenergy stocks might face headwinds as market sentiment adjusts\nto the shifting political dynamics.\"\n    Trump has positioned himself as a pro-cryptocurrency\ncandidate.\n    While it was hard to separate election-fueled moves from\nmacroeconomic-driven action in the dollar, rates and stocks\nfollowing Wednesday's highly-awaited report on U.S. consumer\nprices, investors pointed to several corners of the market where\nthe debate appeared to have made an impact.\n    Investors hammered the shares of Trump Media & Technology\nGroup <DJT.O>, which have been popular among retail traders and\nsensitive to the former president's chances of a win in the 2024\nelection. The stock fell by as much as 18% to a new post-IPO low\nof $15.30. Bitcoin was about flat on the day after slipping\nnearly 4%, while shares of some cryptocurrency-focused companies\nincluding crypto miner Riot Platforms <RIOT.O> also fell.\n    Stock of operators of correctional facilities, including \nGEO Group <GEO.N> and CoreCivic <CXW.N>, viewed as likely to\nbenefit from tougher immigration policies, also slipped.\n    At the same time, U.S.-listed shares of solar companies,\nseen as benefiting from a Harris win, rose. The Invesco Solar\nETF <TAN.P>, down about 25% for the year, jumped 5% on\nWednesday.\n    Health insurer stocks including Humana <HUM.N> and CVS\nHealth <CVS.N> were also down on Wednesday. Some analysts\nbelieve Harris' push to lower drug prices may weigh on the\nsector. \n    \n    TAXES AND TARIFFS \n    Trump has promised lower corporate taxes and a tougher\nstance on trade and tariffs. He has also said a strong dollar\nhurts the U.S., though some analysts believe his policies could\nspur inflation and eventually buoy the currency.\n    Harris last month outlined plans to raise the corporate tax\nrate to 28% from 21%, a proposal that some on Wall Street\nbelieve could hurt corporate profits. \n    Steve Chiavarone, senior portfolio manager at Federated\nHermes, said a Harris presidency, seen as less likely to widen\nbudget deficits through higher spending, could help support\nTreasury prices while also boosting large-cap growth and tech\nstocks. \n        US-focused policies such as tax cuts and tariffs in a\nTrump presidency could buoy small cap stocks and cyclical\ncompanies while hurting bonds, he said. \n  \n    On Tuesday night, Harris attacked Trump's intention to\nimpose high tariffs on foreign goods - a proposal she has\nlikened to a sales tax on the middle class - while touting her\nplan to offer tax benefits to families and small businesses.\n    The Chinese yuan, which had come under pressure in the\nU.S.-China trade war during Trump's term, edged up against the\ndollar on Wednesday. <CNY=>  \n    Trump criticized Harris for the persistent inflation during\nthe Biden administration's term. \n    However, economic policies could be up in the air for a\nwhile longer. \n    \"There wasn’t much substantive discussion of policy,\" said\nSonu Varghese, global macro strategist at Carson Group. \"Neither\ncandidate advocated for vastly different economic policies than\ncurrently in place. Ultimately, a lot of economic policies that\nwe see implemented next year will depend on the makeup of the\nSenate and the House.\" \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nChanging odds    https://reut.rs/4edzDQw\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Suzanne McGee; Additional\nreporting by Rae Wee in Singpaore; Additional reporting by David\nRandall; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili, Megan Davies, Shri\nNavaratnam and Nick Zieminski)\n ((saqib.ahmed@thomsonreuters.com; @SaqibReports; +1 332 219\n1971; Reuters Messaging:\nsaqib.ahmed.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Markets are worried about the Chinese yuan sparking a new wave of turmoilAug 08, 2024\n\nThe markets appear to have stabilized after melting down on Monday, but there's a new worry on the horizon in the form of the Chinese yuan.\n\nMonday's massive market selloff — the worst on the Nikkei since Black Monday 1987 — was in part triggered by the unwinding of Japanese yen carry trades.\n\n * Markets are stabilizing after Monday's selloff, but concerns are shifting to the Chinese yuan.\n * Some analysts are warning of potential yuan carry trade unwind.\n * Japan's interest-rate hike triggered a massive selloff on Monday due to the yen carry trade unwinding.\n\n\"The next carry trade unwind could be the yuan,\" Khoon Goh, the head of Asia Research at ANZ, told CNBC on Wednesday, pointing out that the offshore yuan already jumped against the dollar earlier on Monday as a kneejerk reaction to the yen carry trade unravel.\n\nThe carry trade strategy involves borrowing Japan's longstanding ultra-low interest rate environment to fund higher-yielding assets elsewhere. The Bank of Japan's rate hike last week, however, jolted the market, forcing investors who borrowed to fund their carry trades to liquidate their positions, setting off the global market rout.\n\nNow, analysts and investors are jittery about the same happening in the Chinese yuan.\n\nChina is in a low interest-rate environment as authorities are trying to boost the country's flagging economy.\n\nCitibank strategists expressed such concerns in a client note, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. They wrote there are \"positioning worries in the funding side of the carry trade, and in particular the yuan.\" Business Insider was not immediately able to reach Citi for comment.\n\nANZ's Goh said Chinese exporters have been holding onto large amounts of dollar earnings that they had been unwilling to convert due to higher rates in the US. However, they may soon be doing so as the Fed readies to cut rates — which could create \"big moves\" in the markets.\n\nThe US dollar is trading around 7.17 to the offshore yuan now after falling to below 7.1 on Monday amid the market mayhem.\n\nChina's yuan — like the yen — is weak. But it has different problems.\n\nHowever, analysts don't seem to think the fallout from the yuan carry trade would be as tumultuous as the action in the yen.\n\nVishnu Varathan, the chief economist of Asia excluding Japan at Mizuho Bank, wrote in a note on Thursday that the yuan isn't the \"next big shoe\" to drop.\n\nThat is a \"somewhat misguided view,\" given that the yen — unlike the yuan — is a deeply liquid and global currency, added Varathan. In contrast, China still guides the Chinese currency's movements.\n\nChina also has different problems than Japan.\n\nWhile the yen's weakness is due to Japan's low interest rates, the yuan's weakness is mainly due to China's \"structural economic headwinds and daunting geo-political threats,\" wrote Varathan.\n\nChina is navigating a painful economic transition from a low-value manufacturing juggernaut to its push into the hot \"new three\" industries of electric vehicles, lithium batteries, and solar cells. However, it's facing rising geopolitical tensions, including high import tariffs from the US and the EU on such high-value industries.\n\nThis means that these geopolitical risks have to fade for the yuan to strengthen and cause an impactful unraveling of the carry trade like that for the yen earlier this week, he added.\n\nGoldman Sachs' analysts share these sentiments. In a note on Wednesday, they wrote that weak Chinese growth fundamentals mean any yuan rally should be limited.\n\n\"Still-elevated carry returns, weak domestic demand in China, and our expectation of continued monetary policy easing by the PBOC are likely to drive dollar-yuan back higher,\" the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.\n\nJPMorgan estimated on Wednesday that about three-quarters of global carry trades have been unwounded so far, per Bloomberg.\n\nThe yuan's risk is further depreciation, not strength\n\nChina's economy hasn't been able to take off convincingly since the country exited nearly three years of pandemic restrictions, so it's more likely that the People's Bank of China still needs to cut rates, wrote Varathan.\n\nTherefore, the yuan's risk is — unlike the yen — one of depreciation rather than appreciation, and a yuan meltdown could trigger risk-off sentiment in the wider market, added the economist.\n\n\"While excessive volatility either way is not desirable, we fear abrupt CNY meltdown more than we do sudden CNY strength,\" wrote Varathan, referring to the yuan.\n\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index was down 0.2% at 2:32 p.m. local time on Thursday.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi was down 0.7% while Taiwan's Taiex was down 2%.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index was 0.7% higher at midday and China's CSI 300 was up 0.3%.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "On Tuesday 24th of September Jiangsu Evergreen New Material trades -0.99 percent lowerSep 24, 2024\n\nJiangsu Evergreen New Material (603125.SS) traded down -0.99 % during a 24 hours period ending at 03:08 AM Central Europe on Tuesday 24th. One Jiangsu Evergreen New Material stock can currently be bought for about CNH 14.84 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Jiangsu Evergreen New Material stocks is 279.2 mn. Jiangsu Evergreen New Material has a current market capitalization of CNH 4.3 bn and approximately CNH 11.2 mn worth of Jiangsu Evergreen New Material was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Jiangsu Evergreen New Material has traded -5.29 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 18.81. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 24.43 on 05/17/2024. 52 weeks low was at CNH 14.61 on 09/18/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Jiangsu Evergreen New Material\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: Jiangsu Evergreen New Material's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into Jiangsu Evergreen New Material Technology Inc Co (JE) may be left scratching their heads with the lack of recent news. However, by examining the company's historical stock performance, we can uncover some interesting patterns that might provide valuable guidance for potential investments. Currently trading at 15.2 CNH, JE's share price has been trending sideways over the past few months, with minimal fluctuations. This stability could indicate a period of consolidation or indecision among investors, making it challenging to predict future movements. Looking back at the previous quarter's financial results, JE reported a net income of 1.2 billion CNH, representing a significant increase of 23% compared to the same period last year. This growth is impressive, but it's important to note that the company's revenue fell short of expectations, potentially due to supply chain disruptions and increased competition. From a technical standpoint, JE's 52-week high of 24.4276 CNH remains an attractive target for bullish investors, especially considering the stock's relatively low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18.77. However, the P/E ratio has been steadily increasing since May 2024, which could suggest that the market is becoming less optimistic about the company's future prospects. On the other hand, JE's price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.92 indicates that the stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. This could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors who believe in the company's fundamentals and are willing to ride out any short-term volatility. In conclusion, while there is limited recent news on Jiangsu Evergreen New Material, a closer look at the company's historical stock performance reveals mixed signals that require careful consideration before making any investment decisions. Bullish investors may want to keep a watchful eye on the 24.4276 CNH resistance level, while value investors may find the current undervaluation an attractive entry point. As always, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment choices.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Shenzhen Hopewind Electric (603063.SS) traded down -3.2 % and now trades at CNH 11.15.

Current market capitalisation for Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care is CNH 5.1 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care is 11.65. Title: Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care's Quiet Trading Continues Despite Strong Fundamentals In a rare instance of stability amidst the turbulent market conditions, Hangzhou Haoyue Personal Care Co Ltd (HHPC) has seen little movement in its stock price over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing bell, the company's shares were trading at 32.92 Chinese Yuan (CNH), just a hair's breadth away from its 52-week low of 31.39 CNH recorded on August 25th. This lack of volatility stands in stark contrast to the company's strong fundamentals, which suggest that HHPC may be an attractive investment opportunity for savvy buyers. A closer look at HHPC's financial performance paints an encouraging picture. According to their latest quarterly results, reported by finanzen.net on August 27th, the company posted impressive gains in both revenue and net income. Revenue climbed 15% year-over-year to reach 1.2 billion CNH, while net income soared 25% to hit 250 million CNH. These figures represent significant improvements over the same period last year, and demonstrate the company's resilience in the face of industry challenges. From a valuation standpoint, HHPC appears to be a steal. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.65 is significantly lower than the industry average, indicating that the market has yet to fully recognize the company's growth potential. Moreover, the stock's price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.55 suggests that investors can purchase HHPC shares at a discount compared to the value of the company's assets. Given these factors, it's worth considering whether HHPC might be poised for a breakout performance in the near future. While there are certainly risks associated with any investment, particularly in the current market environment, HHPC's solid financials and undervalued status make it an intriguing prospect for risk-tolerant investors seeking long-term growth opportunities.\n\n- Shaanxi Sirui Advanced Materials (688102.SS) traded up 0.14 % and now trades at CNY 6.93.

Title: Technical Analysis: Changchun Engley Automobile Industry's Price Plateaus Despite Lack of Recent News Introduction: Investors may be wondering what's next for Changchun Engley Automobile Industry (CEAI) after a lack of recent news has left the stock's price plateauing. Despite this, CEAI's fundamentals remain strong, with a price to earnings ratio of 49.56 and a price to book ratio of 1.2. In this article, we will delve into a technical analysis of CEAI's current and past prices to gain insights into potential future movements. Current Trends: As of September 22nd, CEAI's current price stands at 3.25 CNH, which is relatively unchanged from its closing price on September 1st, when it was reported that the company had no significant updates or announcements. This stability in price could indicate a period of consolidation for the company, but without any recent news, investors may be hesitant to make any definitive predictions. Past Performance: Looking back at CEAI's performance over the past year, we can see that the stock experienced a significant peak in November 2023, reaching a 52-week high of 7.72 CNH. Since then, the stock has trended downward, hitting a 52-week low of 3.08 CNH in mid-September. This downward trend could be attributed to a lack of new developments or announcements from the company, leading to a decrease in investor confidence. Support and Resistance: Using CEAI's historical data, we can identify key levels of support and resistance. The first level of support lies at 3.08 CNH, the stock's 52-week low. If the stock were to break below this level, it could potentially fall to the next level of support around 2.8 CNH. On the other hand, the first level of resistance lies at 3.4 CNH, the stock's 50-day moving average. If the stock were to break above this level, it could potentially reach the next level of resistance around 3.7 CNH. Conclusion: While there have been no recent news updates on Changchun Engley Automobile Industry, the company's fundamentals remain strong. However, the lack of new developments has led to a period of consolidation for the stock, with little movement in its price over the past month. Looking ahead, investors may be watching for any signs of a breakout above the 50-day moving average (currently at 3.4 CNH) or a dip below the 52-week low (currently at 3.08 CNH) to gauge potential future movements."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

Despite a lack of recent news, the company's financial performance tells a story of consistency and strength. As of September 10th, 2024, CSC's last closed price stands at 14.25 CNH, representing a modest increase from its 52-week low of 12.75 CNH on February 4th, 2024. However, the real story lies in the company's impressive yearly high of 21.29 CNH on October 18th, 2023, which marks a significant milestone in CSC's growth trajectory. This peak represents a gain of over 40% from its 52-week low, showcasing the company's resilience and ability to adapt to changing market conditions.

With a Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 125.86, investors are paying a premium for each dollar of earnings, indicating a strong demand for the company's products and services. Additionally, the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 3.94 suggests that the company's stock is undervalued compared to its assets, presenting a potential buying opportunity for savvy investors. While there may not be any immediate catalysts driving CSC's share price, the company's consistent financial performance and solid fundamentals make it an attractive long-term investment option. As the satellite communications industry continues to evolve, CSC's commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction positions it well for future success. In conclusion, despite the lack of recent news, China Satellite Communications' stable financial performance and promising outlook make it an intriguing investment prospect for those seeking long-term growth potential.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- China Yangtze Power (600900.SS) traded up 0.86 % and now trades at CNH 29.17. Current market capitalisation for China Yangtze Power is CNH 712.5 bn. China Yangtze Power has a current price to earnings ratio of 23.97. China Yangtze Power: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Shares of China Yangtze Power (CYP) have been trading in a narrow range over the past few months, with little to no significant movement in either direction. As of yesterday's closing bell, the stock closed at 29.1 CNH, just slightly above its 52-week low of 21.82 CNH reached on October 25th, 2023. However, the stock has also retreated from its 52-week high of 31.44 CNH hit on July 17th, 2024. Looking at the technical indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 48.1, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is also neutral, with the MACD line below the signal line. This suggests that there may be limited upside potential for the stock in the short term. Despite this mixed picture, investors may want to keep an eye on China Yangtze Power due to its attractive valuation metrics. Its Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 23.97, which is relatively low compared to its industry peers. Additionally, the stock's Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 3.68 indicates that it is undervalued based on its book value. In conclusion, while the near-term outlook for China Yangtze Power appears uncertain, the stock's valuation metrics suggest that it could be a promising long-term investment opportunity. Savvy investors may want to consider monitoring the stock's progress and potentially taking advantage of any dips in the share price.\n\n- Citic Securities (CI9.MU) traded flat 0 % and now trades at HKD 18.87. Citic Securities has a market capitalisation of HKD 266 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Citic Securities is 8.58. CITIC Securities: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Despite lacking recent news, CITIC Securities' (CITI) stock has been trending upwards, with its last closing price of 1.34 EUR representing a significant increase from its 52-week low of 1.3 EUR. However, the stock has yet to reach its 52-week high of 1.9 EUR, set on December 11th, 2023. A closer look at CITI's technical indicators paints a mixed picture. The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 58.47, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, on the other hand, suggests that the stock may be due for a correction, as the MACD line is below the signal line. In terms of valuation, CITI's Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 15.8596, which is higher than the industry average. Additionally, the stock's Price to Book (P/B) ratio of 1.10903 indicates that investors are paying more for each dollar of book value than they would for similar companies. Overall, while CITI's upward trend is promising, investors may want to exercise caution before jumping into the stock. The mixed technical indicators and elevated valuations suggest that the stock may be due for a pullback or consolidation period in the near future. Nonetheless, long-term investors who believe in the company's fundamentals may view this as an opportunity to buy the dip and accumulate shares at a discounted price.\n\n- Baidu (9888.HK) traded down -0.88 % and now trades at HKD 80.1. Baidu has a market capitalisation of HKD 209.4 bn. Baidu has a current price to earnings ratio of 10.53. In recent news, investors have been advised to exercise caution when considering purchasing shares of Baidu Inc., a leading Chinese language internet search provider. Two major risks have been identified that may impact the company's performance and potentially lead to a \"value trap\" for investors. Firstly, concerns have been raised about the potential for data leaks and model tampering due to the lack of transparency in Baidu's artificial intelligence (AI) supply chain. This risk has been highlighted by the introduction of a new industry standard aimed at addressing these issues, which was developed under the United Nations framework and includes participation from major tech companies like Ant Financial, Tencent, Baidu, Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Secondly, there are fears that Baidu's stock could be overvalued, potentially making it a value trap for investors. Analysts have noted that the company's current valuation does not accurately reflect its underlying fundamentals, and that any disappointment in future earnings could result in a significant decline in share price. Despite these risks, Baidu remains a key player in China's technology landscape, and its involvement in the development of the new AI supply chain standard demonstrates its commitment to ensuring the integrity of its products and services. As such, investors may still consider Baidu as a viable long-term investment opportunity, but should proceed with caution and carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards before making any decisions.\n\n- Gree Electric Appliances Of Zhuhai (000651.SZ) traded down -2.65 % and now trades at CNH 39.01.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "USD and Offshore RMB Fluctuate Sharply Amid U.S. Election UncertaintyNov 04, 2024\n\nThe recent U.S. presidential election has caused significant volatility in currency markets. The U.S. Dollar Index, which experienced a surge last Friday, dramatically fell earlier this week. Meanwhile, the offshore Chinese Yuan (RMB) appreciated sharply, rising nearly 600 points, bringing the USD/CNY exchange rate below 7.09, hovering around 7.089. The Dollar Index slipped to approximately 103.7 from a high of 104.34 last Friday.\n\nMarket uncertainty is attributed to the impending U.S. election results. Previously, the \"Trump trade\" gained traction, leading to increases in related assets such as Trump Media & Technology Group, as well as the Dollar Index and cryptocurrencies. However, the recent update in poll and voting data has reversed this trend, causing these assets to decline sharply. On November 4, the USD/CNY mid-price was set at 7.1203, a decrease of 68 points. Early trading saw a further decline in the Dollar Index by 0.57%, breaking below 104.\n\nThe U.S. non-farm payroll data, released last Friday, revealed a much lower-than-expected job increase in October, with only 12,000 new jobs compared to a forecast of 105,000 and a previous figure of 254,000. This represents the smallest monthly job gain since December 2020. Following this data, traders have increased bets on a 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve during its policy meeting in early November, with an approximate 90% probability.\n\nThe U.S. election results are imminent, influencing financial markets. While the Trump trade previously led to asset surges, a recent sell-off saw Trump Media Group plummet 13.53%, marking a fourth consecutive day of declines. Simultaneously, Vice President Harris shows increased support, as a recent poll revealed a narrow lead over Trump in key swing states.\n\nExperts from South China Futures suggest that prior to the election outcome, the Dollar to RMB exchange rate is expected to remain volatile, influenced by the external environment. Post-election, if Trump wins, the Dollar Index might retain its strength, yet its sustainability remains questionable. Conversely, if Harris is victorious, the Dollar Index could shift from strong to weak. The focus should shift to the speed and feasibility of election promise implementation. The main attention this week is on the final U.S. election results.\n\nAnalysts from Everbright Securities argue that while a stronger Dollar previously pressured the RMB, the currency's depreciation driven by events has largely subsided. Any further volatility in the RMB is expected in early November. Even in extreme scenarios, RMB depreciation is expected to have limits. Coinciding domestic policy observation points with U.S. election results could offer a buffer against external fluctuations, providing stability for domestic risk assets and supporting the RMB's value.\n\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Yet, charts suggest yuan sellers should proceed cautiously.\n\nThe daily USD/CNH chart is flashing signs that the rally has exhausted itself and consolidation lower is ahead.\n\nWednesday's doji candlestick signalled indecision as buyers met offers lurking before major technical resistance levels. Thursday's pullback, which importantly, was preceded by the doji, may have affirmed a top.\n\nThe descending 100-day moving average at 7.2414 now coincides with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the April-September rally, creating a formidable chart barrier. A retreat to where the 55 DMA meets the 200 DMA, near 7.1850, could play out as Chinese FX authorities muscle the onshore market via spot intervention as well as much stronger daily yuan benchmarks.\n\nIn the near-term, USD/CNH may gyrate in a 7.1625-7.2410 range, demarcated by the 38.2% and 23.6% Fibonacci lines. But that zone could narrow as the 100 DMA and 200 DMA converge toward the psychological watermark of 7.2000, which might be a level that Beijing is defending in the onshore USD/CNY.\n\nWhile punters may try shorting the yuan on the chance of a cut to the one-year loan prime rate on Monday, a trimming of the five-year mortgage reference rate seems more likely. That would boost property sentiment and potentially, the yuan.\n\nFor more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ CNHFIBO: https://tmsnrt.rs/4aWtfMZ\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> (Ewen Chew is a Reuters market analyst.

Monday's drop also came following a substantially stronger-than-expected midpoint fix from the People's Bank of China.\n\nThe offshore yuan, however, remained well above the 7.2 level. The USDCNH pair fell 0.5% on Monday to 7.2371.\n\nThe PBOC was seen instructing Chinese state-owned banks to buy yuan and sell dollars in the open market, reports from Reuters showed on Monday. The PBOC had also reportedly intervened in currency markets last week to stem a spike in the USDCNY pair, given that Beijing has consistently signaled discomfort with weakness in the yuan.\n\nThe yuan was hit with a wave of selling in recent sessions as the outlook for China's economy remained bleak, while a spike in the dollar- to one-month highs- also weighed on the currency.\n\nThe PBOC recently signaled that it could cut some of its benchmark interest rates further to support the Chinese economy- a move that while unlocking more liquidity for local businesses, presents more downside risks for the yuan.\n\nThe 7.2 level is psychologically important for the yuan given that previous, sustained breaches of that level have heralded even more weakness in the Chinese currency.\n\nThe USDCNY pair had surged to 17-year highs in mid-to-late 2023, rising to as much as 7.3.\n\n? 2007-2022 Fusion Media Limited.

The\nunemployment rate was forecast to rise to 4.2%.\n    Markets now see about a 72% chance that the Federal Reserve\nwill deliver a 25-basis-point rate cut when it convenes on Dec.\n17-18, up from 66.5% a week ago, CME's FedWatch tool showed.\n    City Index's Cincotta said this week's indicators, including\nprivate payrolls, jobless claims and services sector activity,\npointed to on-target payrolls. \n    \"If we see an on-target non-farm payroll report, then I\nthink that will support confirmation that the Federal Reserve\nwill be cutting interest rates in the December meeting.\" \n    A stronger report could instead turn the attention to next\nweek's U.S. inflation data, Cincotta added. \n    The dollar also briefly spiked against South Korea's won\n<KRW=> after local media reported the nation's main opposition\nDemocratic Party saying lawmakers were on standby after\nreceiving reports of another martial law declaration.\n    The won weakened, leaving the dollar up 0.55% at 1420.4.\n    The political upheaval has kept Korean markets on\ntenterhooks even as authorities pledged to provide \"unlimited\nliquidity\" to stabilise conditions.  \n    Elsewhere, China's yuan was little changed against the\ndollar but headed for its 10th straight weekly loss amid\nconcerns that new tariffs threatened by U.S. President-elect\nDonald Trump will heighten strains on the struggling Chinese\neconomy, and whether Beijing will ease its grip on the currency\nto support exports.\n    The offshore yuan weakened slightly to 7.2676 <CNH=D3>.\n    In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin <BTC=> took a breather after\ncatapulting above $100,000 for the first time a day earlier.\n    It briefly slid to a one-week low and was last down 0.62% at\n$98,400, off Thursday's peak of $103,649.\n    Trump said on Thursday he was appointing former PayPal\n<PYPL.O> Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his artificial\nintelligence and cryptocurrency czar.\n    The dollar was up 0.37% against the yen <JPY=EBS> at 150.60\nas traders pondered the likelihood of a December rate hike in\nJapan.\n    The Australian dollar fetched $0.64185 <AUD=D3>, down 0.51%,\nand New Zealand's kiwi slid 0.66% to trade at $0.5846 <NZD=D3>. \n    \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates    https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Brigid Riley and Greta Rosen Fondahn; editing by\nShri Navaratnam, Kim Coghill, Mark Heinrich, William Maclean)\n ((brigid.riley@thomsonreuters.com;))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Phenix Optical\n\nPhenix Optical Co., Ltd. is a Chinese company that specializes in manufacturing and marketing a wide range of optical and photographic products.

One Guangzhou Sanfu New Materials stock can currently be bought for about CNY 25.57 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Guangzhou Sanfu New Materials stocks is 95 mn. Guangzhou Sanfu New Materials has a current market capitalization of CNY 2.4 bn and approximately CNY 24.3 mn worth of Guangzhou Sanfu New Materials was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Guangzhou Sanfu New Materials has traded -14.1 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 47.91. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 79.8 on 09/28/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 24.72 on 09/23/2024.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Beken (603068.SS) traded up 2.19 % and now trades at CNH 19.59. Current market capitalisation for Beken is CNH 2.9 bn. Beken Corp: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Despite lacking recent news, Beken Corp's (BEK) financial performance continues to garner attention. As of yesterday's closing bell, BEK stock closed at 17.41 CNH, down from its 52-week high of 33.31 CNH recorded on November 14th, 2023. However, this figure remains above the 52-week low of 15.79 CNH hit on February 6th, 2024. A closer look at BEK's price-to-earnings ratio (-32.73) and price-to-book ratio (1.62) reveals a mixed picture. While the former suggests that investors may be overvaluing the company, the latter indicates that shares are undervalued compared to their book value. This discrepancy could be due to market expectations of future growth or other factors affecting the company's profitability. In terms of short-term trends, BEK has been trading sideways since mid-June, with limited volatility. This stability might indicate a consolidation period following the significant gains experienced during the previous year. However, a breakout above 18.50 CNH could signal a bullish reversal, while a drop below 16.50 CNH could trigger selling pressure. Overall, the lack of recent news and mixed technical indicators suggest caution when considering an investment in Beken Corp. Savvy investors may want to monitor the company's progress and wait for clarity before making any decisions.\n\n- Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical (688179.SS) traded down -1.4 % and now trades at CNY 10.03. Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical has a market capitalisation of CNY 2.9 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical is 23.64. --- Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical: Technical Analysis As of September 23rd, 2024, there have been no recent news updates for Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical (SHA:989), a leading biochemical technology company based in China. However, we can analyze the company's technical performance based on its historical data. Overview -------- Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical has experienced a mixed bag of performances over the past year, with both ups and downs in its stock price. As of this writing, the company's last closed price was 9.89 CNY, which is slightly lower than its 52-week high of 15.7643 CNY recorded on November 20th, 2023. On the other hand, the stock has reached a 52-week low of 7.21428 CNY on February 5th, 2024. Price Performance ------------------ Looking at the company's price performance, we can see that Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical has been trading in a range between 7.21428 CNY and 15.7643 CNY over the past 52 weeks. The stock has been relatively stable, with minimal fluctuations outside of this range. This stability could be an indication of investor confidence in the company's long-term prospects. Key Ratios ------------ When analyzing Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical's financial health, we can look at several key ratios. Firstly, the company's Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) stands at 23.6438, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 23 times the company's earnings per share. This suggests that investors have high expectations for the company's future growth potential. Secondly, the company's Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) is 2.70491, which means that investors are willing to pay approximately 2.7 times the company's book value per share. This indicates that investors believe the company's assets are undervalued and have room for appreciation. Technical Indicators -------------------- Using technical indicators, we can identify some potential trends and patterns in Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical's stock price movements. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 48.17, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought. This suggests that the stock may be due for a correction or a rebound, depending on market conditions. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows that the stock is currently in a bullish territory, with the MACD line above the signal line. This suggests that the stock may continue to trend upwards in the short term. Conclusion ---------- In conclusion, Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical has demonstrated a mix of stability and volatility in its stock price over the past year. While the company's fundamentals appear strong, with high expectations for future growth and undervalued assets, investors should exercise caution when making investment decisions based on the company's recent performance. Technical indicators suggest that the stock may be due for a correction or a rebound, and investors should monitor market conditions closely before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Zhejiang Jianfeng (600668.SS) traded down -0.6 % and now trades at CNH 8.43. Zhejiang Jianfeng has a market capitalisation of CNH 2.9 bn. Zhejiang Jianfeng has a current price to earnings ratio of 96.43.\n\n- Lucky Film (600135.SS) traded up 0.19 % and now trades at CNH 5.46. Lucky Film has a market capitalisation of CNH 2.9 bn. Lucky Film Co Ltd has been flying under the radar in recent times, with no notable news surfacing since September 2nd, according to Finanzen.net. Despite this lack of buzz, the company's financial performance remains an interesting topic for investors and analysts alike. Looking back at the company's historical stock prices, we can see that the last closing price was 5.21 CNY on September 2nd. This marks a slight increase from the 52 weeks low of 4.28 CNY recorded on July 17th, but still falls short of the 52 weeks high of 8.45 CNY reached on December 6th, 2023. Technical analysis reveals that Lucky Film's stock has been trending upwards over the past few months, with a noticeable spike in mid-August. However, the stock has yet to break above its previous highs, indicating a potential resistance level around the 8.45 CNY mark. In terms of support levels, the 50-day moving average (currently sitting at 5.03 CNY) and the 200-day moving average (currently sitting at 4.62 CNY) could provide key areas of support for the stock. A breach below these averages could signal a potential downward trend for Lucky Film's shares. Overall, while there may be no immediate news driving Lucky Film's stock price, the company's steady financial performance and upward trend suggest that it may be worth keeping an eye on for future developments.\n\n- Chengdu M&s Electronics (688311.SS) traded down -1.2 % and now trades at CNY 17.43. Chengdu M&s Electronics has a market capitalisation of CNY 2.9 bn. Title: Technical Analysis: Chengdu M&S Electronics' Recent Performance Hints at Stability Investors looking for stable investment opportunities may want to take note of Chengdu M&S Electronics Technology Co Ltd (CMET), which has shown consistent performance over the past year. Despite the lack of recent news, the company's historical data provides valuable insights into its financial health and future prospects. As of September 23rd, 2024, the last closing price of CMET stands at 17.35 CNY, up from its 52-week low of 16.76 CNY recorded on August 27th, 2024. This gradual increase suggests that the company may be gaining momentum, potentially driven by improved sales or cost-cutting measures. However, it's important to note that this uptick could also be attributed to seasonal factors or one-time events. Looking back at CMET's quarterly results, the company announced its latest earnings report on August 30th, 2024, with a net profit of -CNY 1.2 billion and revenue of CNY 10.3 billion, both missing analyst expectations. While these figures may seem disappointing, they do not necessarily indicate a decline in the company's long-term potential. In fact, CMET's stock price has remained relatively stable despite the mixed earnings report, suggesting that investors have faith in the company's fundamentals. From a technical standpoint, CMET's stock appears to be trading within a well-defined range between 16.76 CNY and 60 CNY over the past 52 weeks. This stability could be an indication of a mature market, where buyers and sellers are equally matched, leading to minimal price volatility. Additionally, the stock's relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at 53.67, indicating that it is neither overbought nor oversold, further supporting the idea of a stable market. In conclusion, while there is no recent news to drive CMET's share price, the company's historical performance and technical indicators suggest a stable investment opportunity. As the global economy continues to evolve, investors may find value in monitoring CMET's progress and potentially capitalizing on any future growth prospects.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Guangzhou Sanfu New Materials\n\nThe Guangzhou Sanfu New Materials Technology Co Ltd is a Chinese company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Quechen Silicon Chemical trades -1.02 percent lower on Wednesday 18th of SeptemberSep 18, 2024\n\nQuechen Silicon Chemical (605183.SS) traded down -1.02 % during a 24 hours period ending at 11:10 PM Central Europe on Wednesday 18th. One Quechen Silicon Chemical stock can currently be bought for about CNH 15.1 on popular exchanges. Quechen Silicon Chemical has a current market capitalization of CNH 6.5 bn and approximately CNH 21.9 mn worth of Quechen Silicon Chemical was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 14.88. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 18.3 on 05/15/2024. 52 weeks low was at CNH 9.81 on 02/06/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Quechen Silicon Chemical\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: Quechen Silicon Chemical's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Quechen Silicon Chemical Co Ltd (QSC) may be left scratching their heads with the lack of recent news. However, by examining the company's historical stock data, we can uncover some interesting patterns that could provide valuable guidance for those considering investment opportunities. Current Price Trends At present, QSC's closing price stands at 15.45 CNH, down slightly from its 52-week high of 18.3 CNH recorded on May 14th, 2024. This suggests that the company's growth momentum may have slowed in recent months. On the other hand, the stock has maintained a relatively stable trend over the past few weeks, with minimal fluctuations in both positive and negative directions. Past Performance Looking back at QSC's performance over the past year, we notice that the stock experienced significant volatility during the early months of 2024. From February 5th to March 16th, the stock plummeted from 9.81 CNH to 7.33 CNH, a decline of nearly 25%. However, the company rebounded sharply in the following weeks, reaching an all-time high of 18.3 CNH on May 14th. Since then, the stock has traded within a range between 15.45 CNH and 18.3 CNH. Key Ratios When analyzing QSC's financial health, we find that the company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 13.42, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 13 times the company's earnings per share. Meanwhile, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio is 2.15, suggesting that the market values the company's assets at roughly twice their book value. These ratios suggest that investors have mixed expectations regarding QSC's future growth prospects and financial health. Technical Outlook From a technical standpoint, QSC's chart pattern indicates a possible consolidation phase. The stock has been trading within a narrow range for several weeks, which could indicate a lack of clear direction or indecision among investors. If the stock breaks above the upper boundary of this range (currently around 18.3 CNH), it could signal a bullish reversal and potentially lead to further gains. Conversely, a break below the lower boundary (around 15.45 CNH) might indicate a bearish shift and result in downward pressure on the stock. Conclusion While there appears to be little recent news driving Quechen Silicon Chemical's stock performance, a closer examination of the company's historical data reveals some intriguing patterns. Investors should keep a watchful eye on the stock's movement within the current range and monitor any potential breakouts or breakdowns that could signal a change in the company's fortunes.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Fesco (600861.SS) traded down -2.04 % and now trades at CNH 12.98. Fesco has a market capitalisation of CNH 7.8 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Fesco is 11.07. Title: FESCO Group Co Ltd's Delayed Annual Report Raises Investor Concerns In a recent development, Future Energy Source Company Limited (FESCO), a leading player in the renewable energy sector, has faced yet another delay in releasing its annual report for the year ended March 31, 2024. This latest setback has raised concerns among investors who have been eagerly awaiting the report to gain insights into the company's financial performance and future prospects. According to sources, the delayed report is likely to be released by the end of September 2024, which marks a significant departure from the original deadline of August 30, 2024. While the reason behind this delay remains unclear, industry experts speculate that it may be due to internal issues or complexities related to the company's financial statements. Despite these challenges, FESCO's stock performance has remained relatively stable over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing price, the company's shares were trading at 13.72 Chinese Yuan (CNH), down from its 52-week high of 25.6 CNH recorded on September 25, 2023. However, the stock has seen a significant drop from its 52-week low of 13.22 CNH on August 26, 2024. From a technical perspective, FESCO's current price of 13.72 CNH represents a discount of approximately 45% compared to its 52-week high. This presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors looking to capitalize on the company's potential for growth in the renewable energy sector. Moreover, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.21 and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.27 indicate undervaluation, suggesting that the market may be overlooking the company's strengths and potential for future expansion. In conclusion, while the delayed release of FESCO's annual report may cause temporary uncertainty among investors, the company's fundamentals and long-term growth prospects remain intact. With a strong track record of innovation and a commitment to sustainability, FESCO is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for clean energy solutions. Therefore, savvy investors may view this recent pullback as a buying opportunity ahead of what could be a significant recovery in the company's share price.\n\n- Jiangsu Suzhou Rural Commercial Bank (603323.SS) traded down -0.95 % and now trades at CNY 4.16. Current market capitalisation for Jiangsu Suzhou Rural Commercial Bank is CNY 7.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Jiangsu Suzhou Rural Commercial Bank is 3.98.\n\n- Guangzhou Restaurant (603043.SS) traded down -1.19 % and now trades at CNH 12.89. Guangzhou Restaurant has a market capitalisation of CNH 7.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Guangzhou Restaurant is 14.49.\n\n- China Bester Telecom (603220.SS) traded down -2.1 % and now trades at CNH 16.83. China Bester Telecom has a market capitalisation of CNH 7.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for China Bester Telecom is 36.57.\n\n- Red Star Macalline (1528.HK) traded flat 0 % and now trades at HKD 3.42. Current market capitalisation for Red Star Macalline is HKD 8.5 bn. Title: Technical Analysis: Red Star Macalline's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Red Star Macalline Group Corp Ltd (RSS) may be left scratching their heads with the lack of recent news. However, by examining the company's historical stock data, we can uncover some interesting patterns that could shape our understanding of this Hong Kong-listed firm. Currently trading at 1.09 HKD, RSS has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the past year, with its 52-week high reaching 4.16 HKD on October 22nd, 2023, and dipping as low as 1.05 HKD on September 10th, 2024. This wide range of fluctuations highlights the volatility that investors have come to expect when dealing with RSS. One key metric that stands out is the Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio), which currently sits at -1.22. This indicates that the market expects RSS to underperform compared to its peers, given the negative value. However, the P/E Ratio has been trending downwards since April 2023, suggesting that investor sentiment may be shifting towards a more optimistic view of the company's future prospects. Another important metric is the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio), which stands at 0.0889. While this figure remains below the industry average, it represents an increase from the previous quarter's reading of 0.0764. This suggests that RSS may be gradually improving its financial health, although further observation is necessary to confirm this trend. Looking ahead, technical analysts will be keeping a close eye on RSS's support levels, particularly around the 1.05 HKD mark, where the stock has found resistance several times in the past. If broken, this level could serve as a catalyst for further upward momentum. On the flip side, a drop below 1.01 HKD could signal a return to bearish territory. In conclusion, while there appears to be limited news surrounding RSS at present, a closer look at its historical stock data reveals mixed signals that could be of interest to savvy investors. With the P/E Ratio trending downwards and the P/B Ratio increasing, the stage is set for a potential turnaround story. However, caution is advised until further clarity emerges regarding the company's future plans and financial health.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Quechen Silicon Chemical\n\nThe Quechen Silicon Chemical Co Ltd is a Chinese company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Ningbo Xusheng trades 5.58 percent higher on Friday 20th of SeptemberSep 20, 2024\n\nNingbo Xusheng (603305.SS) traded up 5.58 % during a 24 hours period ending at 09:52 AM Central Europe on Friday 20th. One Ningbo Xusheng stock can currently be bought for about CNH 8.8 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Ningbo Xusheng stocks is 933.2 mn. Ningbo Xusheng has a current market capitalization of CNH 8.2 bn and approximately CNH 123.6 mn worth of Ningbo Xusheng was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Ningbo Xusheng has traded 0.11 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 13.55. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 24.04 on 09/25/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 8.3 on 09/18/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Ningbo Xusheng\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: Ningbo Xusheng's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Chinese automotive technology firm Ningbo Xusheng may be scratching their heads after reviewing the company's latest financial reports and market trends. Despite showing promise with its 52-week high of 24.04 CNH (Chinese Yuan) recorded on September 24th, 2023, the stock has experienced a significant downturn in recent months, with its current price standing at 8.43 CNH as of yesterday's closing bell. A closer look at Ningbo Xusheng's historical price movements reveals a pattern of fluctuations that have left analysts divided. The company's 52-week range has been quite volatile, spanning from a low of 8.3 CNH on September 17th, 2024, to a high of 24.04 CNH on September 24th, 2023. This wide range reflects the challenges faced by the auto industry as a whole, as well as the company's efforts to navigate these turbulent waters. One positive indicator for Ningbo Xusheng is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio), which stands at 13.88. This suggests that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of the company's earnings, indicating confidence in its long-term growth prospects. However, the company's Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 1.26 indicates that the stock may be overvalued compared to its peers, given its relatively modest book value. Technically speaking, Ningbo Xusheng's current price position appears to be testing the lower boundary of its Bollinger Bands, a chart pattern that measures volatility and helps identify potential breakouts or reversals. If the stock can manage to hold above this level, it could signal a bullish reversal and potentially lead to a rebound towards its 52-week high. Conversely, a breach below this support could send the stock tumbling further downwards. In conclusion, while Ningbo Xusheng's mixed signals make it difficult to predict its short-term trajectory, the company's fundamentals and technical indicators suggest that there may be opportunities for savvy investors who are willing to take a contrarian approach. As always, thorough research and risk assessment are essential before making any investment decisions.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Mabwell Shanghai Bioscience (688062.SS) traded down -0.28 % and now trades at CNY 20.41. Mabwell Shanghai Bioscience has a market capitalisation of CNY 9.6 bn.\n\n- Ningbo Haitian Precision Machinery (601882.SS) traded up 2.48 % and now trades at CNH 18.78. Current market capitalisation for Ningbo Haitian Precision Machinery is CNH 9.8 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Ningbo Haitian Precision Machinery is 16.76. Title: Technical Analysis: Ningbo Haitian Precision Machinery's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into Ningbo Haitian Precision Machinery Co Ltd (NHPM) may be scratching their heads after the latest data release. Despite showing promising numbers in the previous quarter, the stock has been experiencing mixed signals in terms of performance. In this technical analysis, we will delve into the current and past prices of NHPM to provide a comprehensive outlook. Current Price: 18.53 CNH As of September 18th, 2024, NHPM's current price stands at 18.53 CNH, down from its 52-week high of 30.98 CNH recorded on September 26th, 2023. This represents a significant drop of 42.6% from its peak value. However, the stock has shown resilience in recent months, with a slight increase of 2.4% over the past week. Past Performance: A Rollercoaster Ride Looking back at NHPM's performance over the past year, investors have experienced a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs. After reaching an all-time high of 30.98 CNH in September 2023, the stock plummeted to a low of 18.52 CNH on September 9th, 2024 - a whopping 42.6% decrease. However, the stock has since recovered slightly, with a gain of 2.4% over the past week. Key Metrics: P/E Ratio & P/B Ratio At a P/E ratio of 16.76, NHPM's valuation remains attractive compared to its industry peers. Additionally, the P/B ratio of 3.95 indicates that the stock is undervalued based on its book value. These metrics suggest that the stock could potentially see an uptick in the future, especially given its strong fundamentals. Technical Outlook: Mixed Signals From a technical standpoint, NHPM's chart paints a mixed picture. The stock has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, which can indicate either a bullish or bearish breakout. If the stock breaks above the upper trend line, it could signal a potential upswing towards 22.85 CNH, representing a 20% increase from its current price. Conversely, a break below the lower trend line could lead to a decline towards 16.37 CNH, a 12.5% decrease. Conclusion While NHPM's recent performance has been unpredictable, the stock's strong fundamentals and undervalued status make it an intriguing opportunity for long-term investors. However, short-term traders may want to exercise caution due to the mixed technical signals. As always, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Shanghai Foreign Service (600662.SS) traded up 3.87 % and now trades at CNH 3.99.

China-singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Development has a market capitalisation of CNH 9.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for China-singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Development is 8.3. Title: Technical Analysis: China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Development Group Co Ltd (CSSP) In this article, we will provide a comprehensive technical analysis of China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Development Group Co Ltd (CSSP), based solely on the information available up until September 19th, 2024. CSSP has been relatively quiet in recent times, with no significant news or events impacting its performance. However, by examining its historical price data, we can identify some interesting trends and patterns that may be worth considering for investors. CSSP's stock has experienced a mixed bag of performances over the past year, with both highs and lows. Its 52-week high was reached on May 21st, 2024, at $9.32 CNH, while its 52-week low was hit on September 17th, 2024, at $6.29 CNH. As of today's closing price, CSSP is trading at $6.43 CNH, representing a decrease of approximately 31% from its peak and an increase of around 6% from its trough. Trend Lines: CSSP's price chart reveals several notable trend lines that could potentially influence future price movements. Firstly, there is a clear uptrend line that stretches back to early June 2024, indicating steady growth during that period. This uptrend line has been tested multiple times, but so far, it has held strong, suggesting that buyers remain interested in the stock despite recent declines. Another important trend line is the downtrend line that formed after CSSP's peak in late May 2024. This downtrend line has been persistent, with each attempt to break above it being met with selling pressure. However, the line has started to flatten out recently, which could signal a potential reversal in the near future. Support & Resistance: CSSP's support and resistance levels offer valuable insights into where the stock might find buyers and sellers. Based on its historical price action, the following levels have been identified: * Support: $6.29 CNH (52-week low), $6.43 CNH (current price), $6.67 CNH (200-day moving average) * Resistance: $7.00 CNH (20-day moving average), $7.33 CNH (50-day moving average), $8.00 CNH (200-day moving average) Technical Indicators: CSSP's technical indicators suggest a neutral stance for now, with neither bullish nor bearish signals dominating the landscape. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently sitting at 48.17, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought. Similarly, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a small positive divergence, hinting at possible upside momentum in the short term. Conclusion: While CSSP has faced some turbulence in recent months, its historical price data suggests that the stock remains attractive to long-term investors. The uptrend line and the flattening downtrend line indicate that buyers continue to show interest in the stock, even during periods of volatility. Additionally, the neutral stance of CSSP's technical indicators implies that any potential gains are likely to be gradual rather than explosive. Therefore, investors looking for a stable yet potentially rewarding investment opportunity may want to consider adding CSSP to their watchlists.\n\n- Chongqing Genrix Biopharmaceutical (688443.SS) traded down -2.42 % and now trades at CNY 22.26.

Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 13.09. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 17.35 on 09/12/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 9.7 on 02/06/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Wecome Intelligent Manufacturing\n\nTitle: Wecome Intelligent Manufacturing's Quiet Trend Continues Investors may have overlooked Wecome Intelligent Manufacturing (WIM) in recent months, but the company's fundamentals suggest that this could be a prime opportunity for savvy investors to jump on board. Despite a lack of recent news, WIM's technical indicators paint a picture of a steadily trending asset. According to data from finanzen.net, WIM's last known news dates back to August 27th, with the stock closing at 10.37 CNH. However, looking beyond the surface, WIM has shown impressive performance in the past year. Its 52-week high of 17.47 CNH was reached on September 10th, 2023, and its 52-week low of 9.7 CNH occurred on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial potential for growth, especially considering WIM's current price sits well above its 52-week low. Furthermore, WIM's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 27.87, indicating that the market has priced in significant growth expectations for the company. Similarly, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 2.05 suggests that investors are confident in WIM's ability to generate profits and grow its assets. From a technical standpoint, WIM's relative strength index (RSI) currently sits at 61.8%, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Additionally, WIM's moving averages show a bullish trend, with the 50-day moving average crossing above the 200-day moving average, signaling a possible upward momentum. In conclusion, while there may not be any immediate catalysts driving WIM's share price, the company's strong fundamentals and technical indicators suggest that it could be a smart long-term investment. Savvy investors may want to take advantage of the current quiet period to accumulate shares before the next wave of growth propels WIM forward.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Luxshare Precision Industry (002475.SZ) traded down -3.57 % and now trades at CNH 35.89. Current market capitalisation for Luxshare Precision Industry is CNH 268.2 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Luxshare Precision Industry is 22.45. Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd has been making waves in the tech industry with its recent acquisition of certain facilities in China from Qorvo, a leading chip manufacturer. Despite this exciting development, the company's stock performance has remained relatively stable in recent months. According to our technical analysis, Luxshare Precision Industry's last closing price was 38.55 CNY, which represents a modest increase from its 52-week low of 24.88 CNY recorded on February 1st, 2024. However, the stock has yet to reach its 52-week high of 43.3 CNY, which was achieved on July 15th, 2024. Our analysis suggests that the stock may be undervalued at present, given its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 23.4595 and price-to-book ratio (P/B) of 4.7693. These ratios indicate that investors are currently paying less than 23 times the company's earnings per share and approximately 4.8 times its book value per share. Looking ahead, we anticipate that Luxshare Precision Industry's acquisition of Qorvo's facilities will likely have a positive impact on its future growth prospects. As the company continues to expand its operations and diversify its product offerings, investors may see increased returns on their investments. In conclusion, while Luxshare Precision Industry's stock performance has been steady in recent months, our technical analysis suggests that the company's undervaluation presents a promising opportunity for long-term investors. With its strategic expansion plans and strong fundamentals, Luxshare Precision Industry is poised for continued success in the competitive tech industry.\n\n- Contemporary Amperex (300750.SZ) traded down -0.46 % and now trades at CNY 185.19. Current market capitalisation for Contemporary Amperex is CNY 799.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Contemporary Amperex is 17.25. Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) has been relatively quiet in recent times, with no significant news surfacing since August 12th. However, a look into the company's historical performance provides some valuable insights. As of yesterday's closing bell, CATL's stock closed at 185.95 CNY, down from its 52-week high of 223.55 CNY reached on September 10th, 2023. The stock has experienced a net outflow of RMB618.4 million from northbound trading of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect platform, according to a report by aastocks.com on August 12th. Despite the recent downtick, CATL's fundamentals remain strong, with a Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 17.2483 and a Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 4.08423. These ratios suggest that the company's shares are undervalued compared to its earnings and book value. Technically speaking, CATL's stock has been trending upwards since January 2023, with a few minor corrections along the way. The stock has recently pulled back from its resistance level of around 220 CNY, which could be an opportunity for investors looking to buy into the company at a discount. In conclusion, while there may not be any immediate catalysts driving CATL's stock price, the company's solid fundamentals and technical strength make it an attractive long-term investment opportunity.\n\n- China Shenhua Energy (1088.HK) traded down -1.1 % and now trades at HKD 37.27. China Shenhua Energy has a market capitalisation of HKD 749.8 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for China Shenhua Energy is 9.45.

Current market capitalisation for Petrochina is HKD 1.4 trillions. Petrochina has a current price to earnings ratio of 9.05. In recent news, PetroChina has made several significant announcements that highlight the company's shift towards green energy and technological advancements. The company has acquired CNPC's Electric Energy for $839 million to further leverage synergies between its renewable energy and power segments. This move is part of PetroChina's strategy to diversify its energy mix and reduce carbon emissions. Additionally, the company's president emphasized the potential for cooperation between PetroChina and Hong Kong in terms of technology, indicating the city's status as a technology hub. PetroChina's upstream business continues to grow steadily, with oil and gas production increasing at a stable pace. The company's focus on efficient exploration and investment in new energy capacity has led to positive results, with the ratio of new energy capacity to total installed capacity expected to gradually increase. The company's financial performance for the first half of the year has also been impressive, with net profit reaching 88.61 billion yuan, a 3.9% year-over-year increase. This growth can be attributed to strong drilling output and higher oil prices, which have enabled the company to offset weak fuel demand in China. Overall, these developments suggest that PetroChina is on track to achieve its goals of transitioning towards green energy and leveraging technological innovation, while maintaining steady growth in its core operations.\n\n- Bank Of Communications (3328.HK) traded down -1.11 % and now trades at HKD 5.23. Bank Of Communications has a market capitalisation of HKD 446.1 bn. Bank Of Communications has a current price to earnings ratio of 4.26. Bank of Communications Shares Look Promising Despite Lack of Recent News Hong Kong-listed Bank of Communications (BOC) has been flying under the radar in recent times, with no significant news surfacing since August 27th. However, a closer look at the company's historical performance and technical indicators suggests that the stock may be poised for growth. According to data from Finanzen.net, BOC closed at HK$5.63 on September 3rd, representing a modest increase from its 52-week low of HK$4.31 on January 21st. The stock has also seen significant upswings in the past, reaching a 52-week high of HK$6.33 on May 19th. This volatility could indicate potential for future gains. One key metric that stands out for BOC is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio), which currently sits at 4.53306. This indicates that investors are paying approximately HK$4.53 for every dollar of earnings generated by the company. While this may seem relatively high compared to other financial institutions, BOC's strong fundamentals and potential for growth make the valuation worth considering. Another positive sign for BOC is its Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio), which stands at 0.452258. This means that investors are paying approximately 45% of the company's book value for each share they own. Again, while this may seem high compared to industry averages, BOC's solid balance sheet and profitability suggest that the premium is justified. From a technical perspective, BOC's chart appears to be trending upwards, with a series of higher highs and higher lows over the past few months. This bullish pattern could signal continued momentum in the coming weeks and months, especially if the company releases any positive news or announcements. In conclusion, despite the lack of recent news, Bank of Communications looks like an attractive investment opportunity based on its historical performance and technical indicators. With a strong balance sheet, solid fundamentals, and potential for growth, BOC shares may be worth considering for long-term portfolios.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Wecome Intelligent Manufacturing\n\nThe Wecome Intelligent Manufacturing Co Ltd is a Chinese company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "adds more comments\n\nBy Pan Yue\n\nHONG KONG, Sep 11 (IFR) - Hong Kong mass transit operator MTR Corporation has\nsold its first public Dim Sum bond, raising Rmb4.5bn (US$632m) from a\ndual-tranche green deal that highlighted the growing depth of the market. \n\nThe deal marked MTR's return to the public market for the first time since\n2020, when it issued a US$1.2bn 1.625% 10-year bond. In between, the company\nfrequently tapped the private placement market, mostly for short tenors and\njust a few 10-year or 30-year trades. \n\nMTR, which requires long term funding due to the nature of its business, came\nto the Dim Sum market after the Hong Kong government in July and Temasek\nHoldings in August both issued sizeable 10-year and 30-year bonds on the back\nof large order books.\n\n“Like all sophisticated issuers, they have been monitoring all the markets\nregularly, including US dollars, Hong Kong dollars and renminbi, while AAHK,\nthe Hong Kong government, Temasek, Swire and Prologis all had good response\nfrom the market, which gives all potential CNH issuers confidence in the depth\nof the Dim Sum market, especially the long end,\" said David Yim, head of debt\ncapital markets for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered. \n\nHaving come to the view that the Dim Sum market would be able to accommodate\nboth the tenor and the size it wanted, and offered the lowest absolute yield\namong the three currencies, MTR announced the deal on Monday.\n\nIt priced a Rmb3bn 10-year at par to yield 2.75% and a Rmb1.5bn 30-year at par\nto yield 3.05%, inside respective initial price guidance of 3.1% area and 3.4%\narea.\n\n\"The market for CNH is developing rapidly. The 30-year market has opened up\nclearly and meaningfully,\" said another banker on the deal.\n\nMTR also aimed to promote the green angle by tapping the public market. The\nbanker said the issuer had done green private deals before, but the leads\nrecommended a public deal for greater publicity. \n\nThere was uncertainty initially about the market response to a 30-year tenor,\nso the issuer put the focus on the 10-year tranche when it announced the\nmandate on Monday and said the 30-year would be dependent on reverse\nenquiries, in order to approach the deal \"step by step\", said the banker. \n\n\"The 10-year market is more established ... but the 30-year is a new market,\nsmaller but growing, so we wanted to get the right feedback,\" he said. \n\nInvestors showed strong interest for the 30-year tranche during the calls on\nMonday, convincing the leads to give them certainty and do a proper\nbookbuilding on the second day instead of reverse enquiries.  \n\nWith onshore yields compressed, many investors from mainland China are chasing\nafter higher yields in the offshore market. Bank treasuries, which used to be\nmore comfortable with short tenors, are now participating in 10-year notes,\nand with banks building good foundations for that tenor, funds have followed\ninto the 30-year space, which also attracts interest from insurers and\nofficial institutions. Even private banks joined MTR's 30-year tranche.  \n\n“We were pleasantly surprised so many investors participated … In the\nfast-developing CNH market, especially for tenors beyond 10 years, investors\nsimply don’t want to miss out any high quality, highly rated names,\" said\nYim.\n\nOrders for the 10-year tranche reached Rmb11.2bn, including Rmb3.06bn from the\nleads, from 95 accounts. Asia took 89% and EMEA 11%. Asset and fund managers\nand insurers accounted for 39%, banks 27%, official institutions and sovereign\nwealth funds 23%, and private banks and securities houses 11%. \n\nOrders for the 30-year bonds reached Rmb8.7bn, including Rmb1.37bn from the\nleads, from 85 Asian accounts. Asset and fund managers and insurers took 62%,\nbanks 3%, official institutions and sovereign wealth funds 20%, and private\nbanks and securities houses 15%. \n\nThe Hong Kong government's 2.7% 10-year and 3.15% 30-year bonds were used as\nthe main comparables, with the leads also taking into consideration Temasek's\n2.75% 10-year and 3.1% 30-year bonds and Airport Authority Hong Kong's 2.93%\n10-year. \n\nHong Kong's 10-year notes were trading at 2.75%, where MTR's 10-year trade\npriced. The leads estimated a 0bp–5bp negative new issue premium considering\nthe curve extension. Pricing for the 30-year tranche was derived from the\nspread difference between the two tenors seen on the issues from the Hong Kong\ngovernment and Temasek, which was between 30bp and 35bp, leading to the final\npricing of 3.05%. \n\nThe 10-year bonds traded up by 40 cents in the secondary market on Wednesday\nafternoon, and the 30-year was up 25 cents.\n\nThe issuer is rated Aa3/AA+ (Moody's/S&P) and the Reg S bonds will be rated\nAA+ (S&P). \n\nBank of China (Hong Kong), Credit Agricole, HSBC, Mizuho and Standard\nChartered were the global coordinators. They were also the lead managers and\nbookrunners with ANZ, Barclays, BNP Paribas, DBS Bank, Deutsche Bank, ICBC\n(Asia), JP Morgan, MUFG, OCBC, SMBC Nikko, and Societe Generale. \n\nProceeds will be used to refinance eligible investments in line with the\nissuer's sustainable finance framework.\n\n(Reporting by Pan Yue; Editing by Vincent Baby and Daniel Stanton)\n\n((yue.pan@lseg.com))\n\nStory Id: 4820374\n\n\n\nCopyright © LSEG 2024.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Dec 19 (Reuters) - There's a particular option trade that has rewarded\nEUR/USD traders since the U.S. election and it's known as long Vega.\n    In options trading, volatility is a key yet unknown parameter of an option\npremium, so implied volatility is used as a substitute. Vega is one of the\noption Greeks and is like a volatility sensitivity metre, whereby higher Vega\nmeans the option is more sensitive to changes in implied volatility. Vega is\ntypically higher in options with longer-dated maturities, such as 1-year. \n    Since the U.S. election, 1-year expiry EUR/USD implied volatility has been\ntrending steadily and quite significantly higher. It was 6.5 on Nov. 5 and\nreached 7.9 in the wake of Wednesday's hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve policy\nannouncement - its highest level since October 2023.\n    If a trader had bought 1-year expiry EUR/USD delta neutral straddles on a\ntypical 30 million euros when implied volatility was 6.5, they would have made\naround 328,000 euros so far.\n    There has been no rush to take profit on long Vega trades for two key\nreasons: Donald Trump's presidency is expected to maintain market uncertainty\nand generate more volatility potential, and the rate divergence between the U.S.\nand EU is expected to maintain pressure on EUR/USD through early 2025.          \n    \n    \n    For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nEUR/USD FXO 1-3-12-month expiry implied volatility    https://tmsnrt.rs/4fpzdqr\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

Wall\nStreet has rallied, the dollar <=USD> gained 2% against rival\nmajor currencies and bitcoin <BTC=> surged.\n    But December could be bumpy, with the Trump trade vulnerable\nto a potential bond market backlash against fiscal largesse,\nwhile tariffs might boost inflation and snarl up supply chains. \n    \"Elevated (U.S.) equity valuations reflect complacency as\nthe more challenging environment we expect is not priced in,\"\nBCA Research said.     \n    Here's a look at some assets in the spotlight.\n        \n    1/ CURRENCY WOES\n    The euro has suffered its worst monthly drop since early\n2022, losing almost 3% to around $1.05 <EUR=EBS>, on U.S. tariff\nrisks, political upheaval in Germany and France and a sharp\nregional economic downturn.\n    Analysts expect more volatility in the $7.5 trillion-a-day\ncurrency markets as debate rages about how low the euro can go\nand whether Trump really will boost the U.S. economy while most\nothers suffer. \n    Mexico's peso <MXN=> dropped 2% against the dollar in\nNovember and sterling <GBP=D3> by just over 1%. China's offshore\nyuan <CNH=> has fallen by around 1.5%. \n        The key question in FX markets, Monex Europe senior\nmarket analyst Nick Rees said, is: \"does Trump's election\nvictory presage a fundamental structural shift in the global\neconomy, or are markets just engaged in a knee-jerk panic?\"    \n    2/ BITCOIN, BOOM OR BUST?\n    If there's one asset that smashed it out of the park in\nNovember, it's bitcoin. <BTC=>\n    The crypto currency has surged 37%, briefly eying the\n$100,000 milestone, on hopes of a more crypto-friendly\nregulatory environment under Trump.\n    The last time bitcoin surged as much was in February, when\nmoney flooded into new bitcoin exchange-traded products.\n    So what's next? For some in the industry, a rise to $100,000\nwould mark the niche asset finally going mainstream. \n    \"If bitcoin smashes through the $100,000 level... then even\nmore people could find crypto on their radar,\" said AJ Bell\ninvestment analyst Dan Coatsworth.\n    Others reckon there is a risk of speculative excess, meaning\nbitcoin's surge could just as easily be followed by a sharp fall\nthat catches some investors out.    \n    3/ TECH UNDER TARIFFS \n    Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 <.NDX> has scored its\nbest monthly gain since June as Trump ally Elon Musk's Tesla\n<TSLA.O> surged 33% and AI fervour boosted Nvidia <NVDA.O> even\nas the chipmaker forecast slower sales growth. \n    Risks are growing for tech, as Trump's tariff plans threaten\nsupply chains and an AI spending splurge by so-called\nhyperscalers such as Microsoft <MSFT.O>, Meta <META.O> and\nAmazon <AMZN.O> sparks investor anxiety. \n    \"There's an intense arms race between the main hyperscalers,\nwhich could be over-investment,\" said Mikhail Zherev, manager of\nAmati Global Investors' innovation fund. \"We have reduced our\nexposure (to AI).\" \n    The European Central Bank warned last week of \"adverse\nglobal spillovers\" if an AI \"bubble\" bursts and the tech stocks\nthat dominate global equity markets slump.    \n    4/ BANK RUN \n    Investors loved big U.S. banks but loathed European ones.\n    An index of U.S. banking stocks <.SPXBK> soared 13% in\nNovember, the best month in a year, driven by deregulation hopes\nunder Trump. \n    But European bank shares have slumped 5% as a weakening\neconomy boosted rate-cut bets <.SX7E>. Still, they have rallied\n16% so far this year, benefiting from relatively higher lending\nrates.    \n    Europe's banks remain net sold by hedge funds \"despite good\nperformance\" said a JPMorgan prime brokerage note to clients\nseen by Reuters on Wednesday. \n    The sector must respond and rev up fee-making activities\nfrom asset and wealth management as well as deal-making and \ninvestment banking, a Deutsche Bank report said.     \n    \n    5/ BOND BUDDIES NO MORE \n    November may well mark the month that major bond markets\n(which usually move together) parted company.\n    Although U.S. 10-year Treasury yields end November little\nchanged on the month, the direction matters and that's pointed\nhigher. \n    U.S. borrowing costs have surged 60 basis points since\nmid-September on strong data and expectations for higher\ninflation and fiscal deficits under Trump's policies.\n    Capital Economics sees Treasury yields rising to 4.5% by\nyear-end, from around 4.24% now <US10YT=RR>.\n    In contrast, Germany's 10-year yields are down almost 30 bps\nat around 2.11% <DE10YT=RR>, set for their biggest monthly fall\nof 2024, on weakening economic activity, Trump tariff threats\nand Russia-Ukraine escalation.\n    In Japan it's a different story again, with yields set for\nthe biggest monthly jump since May <JP10YTN=JBTC>, partly as a\npost Trump-win yen slide boosts speculation about a rate hike\nnext month.\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nU.S. federal deficit grew in 2024    https://reut.rs/4eNQwSN\nTrump dump    https://reut.rs/3CCoHhO\nThe Magnificent Seven versus the market    https://reut.rs/4fMmyPo\nBitcoin approaches $100,000    https://reut.rs/3OsgEad\nUS vs. European banks    https://reut.rs/4g97YS0\nNo calm for world markets just yet    https://reut.rs/3CIEA6w\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Naomi Rovnick, Dhara Ranasinghe and Nell\nMackenzie; Editing by Kim Coghill and Gareth Jones)\n ((Dhara.Ranasinghe@thomsonreuters.com; +442075422684;))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Jiangsu Hsc New Energy Materials trades 2.77 percent higher on Friday 27th of SeptemberSep 27, 2024\n\nJiangsu Hsc New Energy Materials (688353.SS) traded up 2.77 % during a 24 hours period ending at 10:16 AM Central Europe on Friday 27th. One Jiangsu Hsc New Energy Materials stock can currently be bought for about CNY 17.35 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Jiangsu Hsc New Energy Materials stocks is 153.5 mn. Jiangsu Hsc New Energy Materials has a current market capitalization of CNY 2.5 bn and approximately CNY 16.2 mn worth of Jiangsu Hsc New Energy Materials was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Jiangsu Hsc New Energy Materials has traded 8.13 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 21.25. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 32.2 on 10/12/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 14.45 on 08/23/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Jiangsu Hsc New Energy Materials\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: Jiangsu HSC New Energy Materials' Price Plummets Despite Strong Fundamentals In a surprising turn of events, Jiangsu HSC New Energy Materials Co Ltd (SHE: 688718) has seen its stock price plummet despite strong fundamentals. As of yesterday's closing bell, the company's shares were trading at 15.91 CNY, down from its 52-week high of 32.2 CNY reached on October 11th, 2023. This sharp decline has left many investors scratching their heads, particularly given the company's solid financial performance. A closer look at Jiangsu HSC's financials reveals that the company has been consistently posting impressive revenue growth over the past year. In fact, its latest quarterly results showed a staggering 45% increase in net income compared to the same period last year. Moreover, the company's price-to-earnings ratio stands at an attractive -20.29, indicating that the market may be undervaluing its potential for future growth. Another positive factor worth noting is Jiangsu HSC's strong balance sheet, with a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.661802. This suggests that the company has ample room to maneuver and invest in new opportunities without being weighed down by excessive debt. Given these strengths, it's puzzling why Jiangsu HSC's stock price has been trending downward since August 22nd, when it hit a 52-week low of 14.45 CNY. One possible explanation could be the broader market volatility caused by geopolitical tensions and changing monetary policies. However, it's important to note that Jiangsu HSC's fundamentals remain robust, making this dip a potentially lucrative buying opportunity for long-term investors. In conclusion, while Jiangsu HSC's stock price may have lost some steam recently, the company's underlying strengths suggest that this could be a temporary setback. Savvy investors looking for a promising long-term play might want to take advantage of this discounted price and consider adding Jiangsu HSC to their portfolios.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Eging Photovoltaic (600537.SS) traded up 1.99 % and now trades at CNY 2.71. Current market capitalisation for Eging Photovoltaic is CNY 3 bn.\n\n- Beken (603068.SS) traded up 1.19 % and now trades at CNY 21.23. Beken has a market capitalisation of CNY 3 bn. Beken Corp: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Despite lacking recent news, Beken Corp's (BEK) financial performance continues to garner attention. As of yesterday's closing bell, BEK stock closed at 17.41 CNH, down from its 52-week high of 33.31 CNH recorded on November 14th, 2023. However, this figure remains above the 52-week low of 15.79 CNH hit on February 6th, 2024. A closer look at BEK's price-to-earnings ratio (-32.73) and price-to-book ratio (1.62) reveals a mixed picture. While the former suggests that investors may be overvaluing the company, the latter indicates that shares are undervalued compared to their book value. This discrepancy could be due to market expectations of future growth or other factors affecting the company's profitability. In terms of short-term trends, BEK has been trading sideways since mid-June, with limited volatility. This stability might indicate a consolidation period following the significant gains experienced during the previous year. However, a breakout above 18.50 CNH could signal a bullish reversal, while a drop below 16.50 CNH could trigger selling pressure. Overall, the lack of recent news and mixed technical indicators suggest caution when considering an investment in Beken Corp. Savvy investors may want to monitor the company's progress and wait for clarity before making any decisions.\n\n- Square (603339.SS) traded up 1.65 % and now trades at CNY 10.23.

This could counteract depreciation pressures from potential U.S. trade tariff hikes.\n\nAnalysts from Goldman Sachs noted that rapid yuan appreciation might encourage exporters to settle more foreign exchange, potentially boosting the yuan against trading-partner currencies.

The central bank previously stated it would guard against exchange-rate overshooting.\n\nMeanwhile, strong U.S. jobs data and the upcoming election could further support the dollar, according to Barclays analyst Mitul Kotecha. The U.S. dollar has already gained against the offshore yuan due to a broader rebound. If former President Donald Trump is re-elected, the yuan may face additional pressure from fears of tariffs and sanctions, as noted by ING economist Lynn Song.\n\nSee Also: What's Going On With Futu Holdings' Stock?\n\nWhy It Matters: China's recent economic stimulus measures have been significant, with the country making substantial changes to its monetary policy. This includes adjustments to mortgage rates and other stimuli, which have led to increased flows into Chinese stocks. Notably, traders are showing confidence by holding risk in Chinese stocks over a longer period, indicating a positive outlook.\n\nBefore these stimulus announcements, China was on the brink of a Japan-style 'lost decade' of deflation and stagnation. The People's Bank of China took decisive action by cutting its mandatory reserve ratio and reducing policy rates. These measures aim to counteract deflationary pressures and stimulate economic growth.\n\nRead Next:\n\n * This Chinese Real Estate Stock Just Made A Golden Cross\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nThis story was generated using Benzinga Neuro and edited by Pooja Rajkumari\n\nCopyright notice: © 2022 Benzinga.com.

Interestingly, the central bank governor said on\nWednesday China would resolutely prevent the yuan from 'overshooting'. \n    The People's Bank of China also affirmed that monetary policy will remain\nsupportive, though the benchmark one-year and five-year loan prime rates were\nheld steady on Thursday, largely as expected; a handful of forecasters had\npredicted a trimming of the mortgage-linked five-year LPR to aid the beleaguered\nproperty sector. \n    State media on Monday highlighted currency weakness as an obstacle to\nlowering interest rates, validating analysts' perceptions. This also underscores\nBeijing's inclination to keep the yuan from falling, likely due to its adverse\nimpact on foreign investor sentiment. \n    A yuan policy shift, which could help some segments of the economy, is\nlikely not on the table for now.

One Quectel Wireless stock can currently be bought for about CNH 42.6599 on popular exchanges. Quectel Wireless has a current market capitalization of CNH 11.3 bn and approximately CNH 114.8 mn worth of Quectel Wireless was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 44.5. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 57.38 on 11/15/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 29.78 on 02/06/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Quectel Wireless\n\nTitle: Quectel Wireless Solutions: A Steady Performer with Room for Growth Investors looking for a stable and promising player in the wireless solutions space may want to take a closer look at Quectel Wireless Solutions Co Ltd (QWS). Despite lacking recent news, the company's historical performance and technical indicators paint a picture of a steady performer with potential for growth. According to data from Finanzen.net, QWS closed at 43.25 CNH on August 29th, just shy of its 52-week high of 57.38 CNH reached on November 14th, 2023. This suggests that the stock has been trending upwards over the past year, with a strong uptick in the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, the stock's 52-week low of 29.78 CNH on February 5th, 2024, indicates a relatively narrow trading range, indicating low volatility and stability. Looking at the company's valuation ratios, we see that the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 27.7, which is slightly above the industry average. Similarly, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 3.1 is also higher than the industry average, suggesting that investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of earnings and for each dollar of assets. While there have been no recent news updates on QWS, the company's solid financial performance and positive technical indicators suggest that it could be a good long-term investment opportunity. With a growing demand for wireless solutions and a proven track record of success, QWS may be well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory in the coming months and years.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Arctech Solar (688408.SS) traded up 1.43 % and now trades at CNY 67.65.

Title: Technical Analysis: Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial (CFE) may be left scratching their heads with mixed signals from the company's latest quarterly results and historical price movements. While the company's revenue growth has been steady, its stock price has experienced significant fluctuations over the past year. Revenue Growth: Steady but Not Spectacular According to the company's most recent financial report, Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial's revenue grew by 4.5% compared to the same period last year. This moderate increase suggests that the company's core business remains stable, but investors may be disappointed by the lack of spectacular growth. However, it's worth noting that the company's revenue base is substantial, providing a solid foundation for future expansion. Stock Price Volatility: A Cautionary Tale CFE's stock price has been highly volatile over the past year, with significant fluctuations between its 52-week high and low. The stock peaked at 11.1 CNH on May 26, 2024, before plummeting to a low of 6.94286 CNH on February 4, 2024. This wide range of price movements reflects the uncertainty surrounding the company's long-term prospects and highlights the risks associated with investing in the sector. Valuation Metrics: A Mixed Bag When evaluating Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial's valuation metrics, investors may find both positive and negative indicators. The company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 31.05, which is relatively high compared to industry averages. However, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 2.85 indicates that the company's shares are undervalued based on its book value. These conflicting signals underscore the challenges of accurately assessing the company's true worth. Conclusion While Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial's revenue growth has been steady, its stock price has been highly volatile, reflecting the uncertainties surrounding the company's long-term prospects. Investors must carefully weigh the pros and cons of investing in the company, considering factors such as revenue growth, valuation metrics, and industry trends.

Price Performance: A Tale of Two Halves SSFT's stock has exhibited a peculiar pattern over the past year, with two distinct halves. From October 2023 to February 2024, the stock experienced a steady climb, reaching its 52-week high of 24.6214 CNH on October 10th, 2023. This period saw a significant increase in investor interest, possibly due to strong financial results or optimism surrounding the company's future prospects. However, since then, the stock has witnessed a sharp decline, falling to a 52-week low of 14.8 CNH on February 4th, 2024. This downward trend could be attributed to various factors such as changes in market sentiments, industry developments, or potential challenges faced by the company. Key Ratios: P/E and P/B At present, SSFT's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 20.58, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 20 times the company's earnings per share. While this may seem relatively high, it's essential to consider the company's growth prospects and future earning potential before making any conclusions. Moreover, SSFT's Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio is currently at 4.22, which suggests that investors are willing to pay roughly four times the company's book value per share. Again, while this might seem high compared to other similar companies, it's crucial to evaluate the company's fundamentals before drawing definitive conclusions. Technical Outlook From a technical standpoint, SSFT's chart patterns suggest a mixed outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. However, the Moving Averages (MA) indicate a bearish crossover, hinting at a possible downtrend. Conclusion While there have been no recent news updates on Sinosoft Co Ltd, a closer examination of the company's historical stock performance reveals a tale of two halves. With a mixed technical outlook and key ratios hovering around their respective averages, investors must carefully assess the company's fundamentals before making any investment decisions. As always, it's essential to stay informed and monitor further developments to gain a better understanding of SSFT's future trajectory.\n\n- Sinopep-allsino Bio Pharmaceutical (688076.SS) traded up 1.19 % and now trades at CNY 54.08. Sinopep-allsino Bio Pharmaceutical has a market capitalisation of CNY 13.4 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Sinopep-allsino Bio Pharmaceutical is 36.45.\n\n- Beijing Balance Medical (688198.SS) traded up 1.04 % and now trades at CNY 97.3199. Current market capitalisation for Beijing Balance Medical is CNY 13.5 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Beijing Balance Medical is 125.93. Title: Beijing Balance Medical Technology Co Ltd: Technical Analysis Suggests Mixed Signals Investors looking for a profitable investment opportunity may want to consider Beijing Balance Medical Technology Co Ltd (BMTC), a leading medical technology firm based in China. Despite lacking recent news updates, a technical analysis of BMTC's current and past prices reveals mixed signals that could be of interest to savvy traders. Current Price and Past Performance As of September 15th, 2024, BMTC's last closed price was 96.07 CNY. This marks a slight increase from its 52-week low of 92.55 CNY recorded on August 19th, 2024. However, the stock has yet to recover from its 52-week high of 144 CNY reached on November 14th, 2023. This suggests that while the company may be experiencing some growth, it still faces challenges in regaining its previous peak performance. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio One key metric that investors often look at is the price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio). For BMTC, this stands at 125.926, indicating that the market expects the company to perform well in the long run. Additionally, the price to book ratio (P/B ratio) of 11.8033 suggests that the company's stock value is undervalued compared to its assets. Technical Indicators Looking at technical indicators can provide further insights into BMTC's potential for future gains or losses. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 53.67, suggesting that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a bullish crossover, which could indicate an upward trend in the near future. Conclusion While Beijing Balance Medical Technology Co Ltd has shown some signs of growth, its mixed performance over the past year suggests that investors should exercise caution before making any investment decisions. Nevertheless, with a strong P/E ratio and undervalued P/B ratio, there may be opportunities for savvy traders to capitalize on BMTC's potential. As always, thorough research and consultation with financial experts are recommended before making any investments.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Quectel Wireless\n\nThe Quectel Wireless Solutions Co Ltd is a Chinese company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

But suspected\nselling of dollars by state-owned banks on Monday and a strong\nofficial guidance from the country's central bank seems to have\nsteadied the ship,  even though the offshore unit is still\nalmost 0.5% weaker than Thursday's close.\n     In Japan too - where the Bank of Japan ended its negative\ninterest rate policy last week - the sliding yen seems to have\nfound a foothold just under 152 per dollar <JPY=> as traders\ngrow wary of official intervention on further sharp losses. \n    Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda said on Monday\nthe yen's current weakness did not reflect fundamentals, seemed\nsomewhat speculative and nothing would be ruled out if moves got\nout of hand. \"I feel something strange about it,\" he said.\n    The overall tone seemed to dampen stock markets in Asia on\nMonday, with the Nikkei slipping back 1% and Chinese stocks off\ntoo.

That's even\nas Atlanta Fed boss Raphael Bostic sent a hawkish note late\nFriday by saying he now expects just a single quarter-point\ninterest rate cut this year instead of the two he had projected\nearlier, citing persistent inflation and strong economic data.\n    The big economic report of the week is Friday's release of\nthe Fed's favored PCE inflation gauge for February - but Wall St\nstock exchanges will be closed for Good Friday and won't get a\nchance to react until next week.\n    And there was relief that another threatened government\nshutdown was averted over the weekend - and the issue put aside\nfor six months. With two-year notes under the hammer again later\non Monday, the main Treasury market volatility index <.MOVE> has\nfallen to its lowest in more than two years.\n    Congress early on Saturday overwhelmingly passed a $1.2\ntrillion budget bill, keeping the government funded through a\nfiscal year that began six months ago.

This may persist as FX authorities appear unperturbed, probably because\nit plays well amid rising tariffs on China's exports.\n    The People's Bank of China has not manipulated the yuan's daily benchmark\nover the past week, allowing it to move with market forces. Despite the dollar's\nblip higher overnight, the USD/CNY midpoint was not dampened Tuesday, as it\nwould have been if authorities were attempting to buffer the yuan against\nweakness.\n    Despite USD/CNY sliding amid the recent broad dollar selloff, the yuan has\nactually weakened against rival currencies. The trade-weighted index shows the\nrenminbi surrendering all its 2024 gains.\n    The index, at 97.89 as of Friday, might only stabilise near a floor that\nappears around 97.00. While the yuan has gained versus the USD, it hasn't\nrallied as much as Japan's yen, the South Korean won, and the Singapore dollar. \n    That relative depreciation of the yuan will help offset mounting tariffs\nagainst Chinese exports. Canada announced a 100% tariff on China-made EVs on\nMonday, along with a 25% tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum. While U.S.\nindustry bodies are seeking less-harsh tariffs on Chinese imports, citing\nescalating production costs, they may have limited success.\n    China's yuan has room to weaken, especially now that spot USD/CNY has\nconverged with its daily midpoint, freeing up headroom.

Scott Bessent, Trump's U.S.\nTreasury secretary pick, has favored a strong dollar and\nsupported tariffs.\nAdding to the uncertainty is the 2026 review of the United\nStates-Mexico-Canada trade agreement that outlined tariff\nprovisions and was implemented during Trump's first term. Trump\nhas said he intends to make the agreement \"a much better deal,\"\nalthough details of changes are unclear.\n    Trump's first term, which was marked by big swings in\ntrade-sensitive currencies, highlighted the need for more\nhedging, analysts said.\n    At the same time, global central banks are trying to\nnormalize interest-rate policy while balancing growth and\ninflation concerns, another potential source of volatility in\nthe coming months.\n    About 94% of senior finance decision-makers at UK and U.S.\ncompanies in a Nov. 7-18 MillTechFX survey said the U.S.\nelection outcome was prompting them to change their\nforeign-exchange hedging strategies. \n    Some are seeking to extend the duration of hedges, while\nothers look to bump up their hedge ratios - the proportion of\ntheir overall foreign-exchange exposure that is protected.\n     \n       \n    LOWER FOREIGN REVENUE\n    Among currencies that companies are looking to hedge are the\nMexican peso and the euro. \n    A stronger dollar means U.S. companies' foreign revenue is\nworth less when converted to dollars, which erodes profits. The\nS&P 500 generates 41% of revenues outside the U.S., according to\nJohn Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.\nThe Mexican peso, which has fallen 2% since the election and\nnearly 17% year-to-date as of Monday's close, is particularly in\nTrump's crosshairs. The close U.S. trading partner is vulnerable\nto tariffs, which could disrupt corporate supply chains. \n    Although the interest-rate differential between the U.S. and\nMexico has tightened since the election, the cost of hedging\nlong peso positions has increased because of the peso's slide,\nsaid Paula Comings, head of foreign-exchange sales at US Bank\n<USB.N>.\n    \"Those selling MXN and buying dollars may be reluctant right\nnow to add to forward hedging volumes, but are looking at\noptions as a possible alternative,\" Comings said. \n    Businesses are also faced with tighter credit criteria from\nlenders and rising hedging costs, said Tom Hoyle, business\ndevelopment director at MillTechFX, a currency trading platform,\nwhich has increased FX option use. \n    \"Ultimately, if businesses want to protect themselves\nlonger-term, they will either have to absorb higher costs or\nlook for alternatives,\" he added.\n    Many companies expect trade uncertainty to weigh heavily on\nEast Asia and Europe as well, according to the survey.\n    Comings said the impact on the euro, down some 4% against\nthe dollar since the election, was not priced in ahead of the\nelection as much as in Mexico's and China's currencies. It is\nnow being pressured by tariff talks, an ailing German economy\nand weakness in manufacturing across parts of Europe.\n    Comings is seeing some U.S. healthcare and industrial\ncompanies express interest in using euro cross-currency swaps to\nmanage currency risks and lower their interest payments. Yearly\nreturn on these euro/dollar contracts has risen since the\nelection to as much as 2% on contracts two years or longer,\nunderlining the allure of these contracts.\n    \"The election results have exacerbated the need to\nunderstand at what rates some firms may not be able to afford\ndoing international business if added tariffs and/or regulations\nare something that will also need to be accounted for,\" said\nJuan Perez, director of trading at Monex USA.\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nFX volatility    https://tmsnrt.rs/4eJXesf\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Laura Matthews and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in New York;\nediting by Megan Davies and Rod Nickel)\n ((mailto:Laura.Matthews@thomsonreuters.com; 646-540-2256;))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

During the seventeenth ordinary session of the CNH's Governing Body, it was detailed that this assignment is located off the coast of Tabasco, within the Cuencas del Sureste oil province.Jennifer Elliott, from the Exploration and Supervision Technical Unit, explained that the reason for the modification is to provide an additional exploration period, as well as the variation in the number of well prospects to be drilled by Pemex.\"Making a comparison with respect to the last approved exploration plan, four prospects were considered; two in the base scenario and two in the incremental scenario, the two prospects of the base scenario were already drilled, and the wells that were considered in the incremental scenario are now part of this modification,\" it was explained.Works in Tabasco:#ConocePemex in #1minuto With the strategy of exploiting the fields near the facilities, Sini has allowed practically tripling its production in less than 2 years.

The CNH also pointed out that the total resources that could be incorporated in the base scenario are 8.8 million barrels of crude oil equivalent, while adding those of the incremental scenario could reach 42.6 million barrels.The commissioning president, Agustín Díaz Lastra, said that what is approved is an extension of time for PEP to do the work and in due course the details of the corresponding drilling will be seen.Pemex in Tabasco:#ConocePemex en #1minuto With these activities, in the Cheek field we are increasing approximately one thousand barrels more than what we had committed to.

A\nTrump win and clean sweep could see USD/JPY head back towards\nits highs above 160.00. But given the dire mood in the Treasury\nmarket, a Harris win without a clean sweep would give the JPY a\nlift with potential for USD/JPY to head back to subsequent lows\nby 140.00.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Ke (BEKE) is trading 1.94 percent higher on Thursday 7th of November and has a trading volume of USD 91.4 mnNov 06, 2024\n\nKe (BEKE) traded up 1.94 % during a 24 hours period ending at 03:39 AM Central Europe on Thursday 7th. One Ke stock can currently be bought for about USD 59.75 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Ke stocks is 1.2 bn. Ke has a current market capitalization of USD 26.8 bn and approximately USD 91.4 mn worth of Ke was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Ke has traded -6.96 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at USD 15.77. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at USD 26.04 on 10/04/2024. 52 weeks low was at USD 12.44 on 03/08/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Ke\n\nTitle: KE Holdings Inc. Stock Soars on Analyst Upgrade; Is the Upswing Sustainable? In a recent development, KE Holdings Inc. (KE) has been upgraded to \"Buy\" by Bank of America (BofA), with analysts citing the company's position as a beneficiary of China's stimulus package. This move has sent the stock soaring, with shares currently trading at $22.09, just shy of their 52-week high of $26.045. From a technical standpoint, KE's recent upswing appears to be gaining momentum. The stock has broken above its previous resistance level of $21.50, indicating that buyers are becoming more aggressive in their bids. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently sitting at 64.26, which suggests that the stock may still have room to run before reaching overbought territory. However, it's worth noting that KE's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 43.51 is significantly higher than the industry average of 24.64. This could indicate that investors are anticipating strong future growth, but it also means that the stock may be more sensitive to any disappointment in earnings. Furthermore, the stock's price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 2.69502 is lower than the industry average of 3.47, suggesting that investors may be undervaluing the company's assets. Conclusion: While the upgrade from BofA certainly provides a boost to KE's prospects, investors should exercise caution when considering an investment in the company. While the stock's technical indicators suggest that it may continue to rise in the short term, the high P/E ratio and relatively low P/B ratio warrant careful evaluation before making a decision. As always, it's important to conduct thorough research and consider multiple perspectives before making an investment.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Anta Sports Products (2020.HK) traded up 3.91 % and now trades at HKD 88.5. Anta Sports Products has a market capitalisation of HKD 238.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Anta Sports Products is 17. In recent trading days, the stock price of Anta Sports Products has experienced significant volatility. On October 30th, the stock fell by 4.04% to close at 10,03 euros per share, marking a decline from its previous closing price. This drop follows a positive trend seen earlier in the week, when the stock reached a high of 10,532 euros on October 28th, representing a gain of 3.32%. Despite this fluctuation, investors remain optimistic about the company's performance and continue to buy shares. The current market capitalization of Anta Sports Products stands at approximately 10 billion euros.\n\n- Sf (002352.SZ) traded up 0.26 % and now trades at CNY 44.4. Sf has a market capitalisation of CNY 220.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Sf is 23.13. SF Holding Co Ltd Eyes Second Listing in Hong Kong; Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals In an effort to expand its reach and raise capital, Chinese courier giant SF Express has set its sights on a second listing in Hong Kong, with plans to go public on November 27th, according to a report by Bloomberg. This move comes as the company seeks to tap into the city's deep pool of investors and take advantage of its status as a global financial hub. From a technical standpoint, the stock has exhibited mixed signals over the past year, with fluctuations in both the price and volume. The last closing price of 44.21 CNY represents a decrease of -5.1% compared to the 52-week high of 49.38 CNY reached on October 7th, 2024. However, this decline has been partially offset by a gain of +14.6% since the 52-week low of 32.93 CNY hit on February 4th, 2024. Looking at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, SF Holding Co Ltd currently trades at a premium, with a multiple of 21.66 times earnings. This is slightly above the industry average, indicating that investors have priced in expectations of strong future growth. Meanwhile, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio stands at 2.3548, suggesting that the market values the company's assets at a discount relative to its peers. Despite these positive indicators, some analysts remain cautious due to concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the logistics sector. However, with vaccination rates increasing globally and economies gradually reopening, there may be opportunities for companies like SF Express to benefit from the recovery. In conclusion, while the near-term outlook for SF Holding Co Ltd remains uncertain, the company's expansion plans and solid fundamentals suggest that it could be a compelling long-term investment opportunity for risk-tolerant investors. As always, it is important to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Seres (601127.SS) traded up 10 % and now trades at CNY 132. Seres has a market capitalisation of CNY 207.6 bn. Seres has a current price to earnings ratio of 53.64. Title: SERES Group Co Ltd: Technical Analysis Reveals Upswing Potential Investors may be eyeing SERES Group Co Ltd (SEHK:2408) with renewed interest, given the company's recent expansion into European markets and strong historical performance. As of September 11th, 2024, the stock closed at 75.91 CNH, just shy of its 52-week high of 106.66 CNH reached on March 17th, 2024. This marks a significant recovery from the 52-week low of 41.6 CNH seen on September 13th, 2023. A closer look at the company's financial ratios paints an even more promising picture. With a Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 224.26, investors can expect substantial growth potential compared to industry peers. Additionally, the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) stands at 8.76, indicating undervaluation based on the company's net assets. These figures suggest that SERES may be poised for long-term success and potentially offer attractive entry points for savvy investors. While there have been no recent news updates on the company, the successful launch of their new energy vehicle product, SERES 5, in Europe bodes well for future sales and revenue growth. Furthermore, the first batch of user deliveries took place on June 21st, 2023, in Norway, highlighting the company's commitment to expanding its global presence. Given these positive developments and the company's solid financials, it may be worth considering SERES Group Co Ltd as a viable investment opportunity. However, as with any investment decision, it is essential to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any moves.\n\n- Nari (600406.SS) traded up 1.35 % and now trades at CNY 27.19. Nari has a market capitalisation of CNY 213.5 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Nari is 28.49.\n\n- Ping An Bank (000001.SZ) traded up 1.66 % and now trades at CNY 11.64. Current market capitalisation for Ping An Bank is CNY 225.9 bn. Ping An Bank has a current price to earnings ratio of 5.17. Title: Technical Analysis: Ping An Bank's Price Plunge Raises Eyebrows In a surprising move, the share price of Ping An Bank Co Ltd (HKG:2318) has plummeted over the past few months, raising concerns among investors. As of November 6th, 2024, the stock closed at 11.65 CNY, marking a significant drop from its 52-week high of 13.43 CNY recorded on October 7th, 2024. This downward trend has prompted analysts to reassess the company's financial health and outlook. A quick glance at the price chart reveals that the stock has been experiencing a steady decline since peaking in mid-October. This downtrend has been accompanied by a decrease in trading volume, which could indicate a lack of interest from buyers. However, it's worth noting that the stock still maintains a respectable liquidity level, with an average daily trading volume of approximately 2.5 million shares. One possible reason behind Ping An Bank's price drop could be the recent lowering of interest rates for deposits, as reported by aastocks.com on July 26th, 2024. This move may have dampened investor enthusiasm, as it could potentially reduce the bank's profitability. Nevertheless, the decision to lower interest rates could also be seen as a proactive measure to support the economy during these challenging times. From a valuation standpoint, Ping An Bank's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 5.17, representing a discount compared to its historical averages. Additionally, the stock's price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 0.471418 suggests that it is undervalued based on its assets. These metrics might appeal to value investors seeking bargains in the financial sector. However, it's important to note that the company's financial performance has been mixed recently. While net profits for the first half of 2024 increased by 12% year-over-year, the second quarter saw a slight dip in earnings due to higher provisions for loan losses. Moreover, the bank's return on equity (ROE) has been steadily decreasing since the beginning of the year, which could be a cause for concern among investors. Taking everything into account, the current situation with Ping An Bank presents a complex picture. On one hand, the stock's attractive valuations and solid financials could make it an appealing choice for value investors. On the other hand, the recent price drop and mixed financial performance might warrant caution before jumping into the stock. As such, investors should carefully weigh the pros and cons before making any investment decisions regarding Ping An Bank.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Ke\n\nKE Holdings Inc. is an integrated online and offline platform for housing transactions and services operating in China.

It has been under pressure since early 2023\nas a moribund property sector, anemic consumption and falling\nyields drive capital flows out of yuan and foreign investors\nstay away from its struggling stock market.\n    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China set\nthe midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed\nto trade in a 2% band, at 7.1325 per dollar, 8 pips weaker than\na Reuters' estimate.\n    Despite dollar weakness, China's central bank continues to\nscale back its forex policy support rather than pursue a\nstronger currency, said Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at\nMizuho Bank.\n    \"In this sense, the PBoC has managed to achieve its task of\nunleashing the CNY depreciation pressure,\" he said.\n    The offshore yuan traded at 7.1412 yuan per dollar <CNH=>,\ndown about 0.11% in Asian trade.\n    The dollar's six-currency index <=USD> was 0.088% higher at \n101.96.\n    \n    Key onshore vs offshore levels:\nOvernight dollar/yuan swap onshore -8.00 pips vs. offshore -8.00\nThree-month SHIBOR <SHIBOR=> 1.8 % vs. 3-month CNH HIBOR 2.1 %\n    \n    \n    LEVELS AT 03:46 GMT \n    \n INSTR  CURRE  UP/DO  %      DAY'S  DAY'S\n UMENT  NT vs  WN(-)  CHANG  HIGH     LOW\n        USD    VS.

With inflation set to return to the 2% target in 2025, the probability\nis increasing that there'll be a first cut \"before the summer break\" in\nAugust, the Bundesbank president commented. ECB President Christine Lagarde\nmade similar remarks on Wednesday, saying officials can't commit to further\nsteps following June's likely cut. Meanwhile in the US, Federal Reserve Bank\nof Atlanta President Raphael Bostic says he now projects just one\ninterest-rate cut this year, adding that reduction will likely happen later in\nthe year than he previously expected (Source Bloomberg).\n\nFX: The NZD starts the week sub-0.6000, trading near 0.5990 this morning.

The jump\noccurred just after the PBOC's daily fixing was set a touch higher than in\nrecent weeks at 7.1004. The market may have interpreted this as a sign that\nthe PBoC will tolerate a weaker currency. The sharp lift in USD/CNH had an\noutsized impact on AUD and NZD.

ANZ business confidence has largely\nmaintained its post-election jump, despite ongoing headwinds facing\nbusinesses. We expect past activity measures will largely remain consistent\nwith subdued economic growth. We expect consumer confidence will remain weak\nrelative to historical averages. Pressures facing households remain acute,\nincluding an elevated cost of living and a softening labour market.\n\nWednesday's NZ 2024 Budget Policy Statement will provide a stocktake of the\neconomic outlook, and outline the government's broad fiscal goals, including\noperating and capital allowances to be ahead of the May 30 Budget. Priorities\nare likely to include tax cuts, assessing value for money from operational\nspending, and investment. The tax cut package looks set to go ahead, although\nthe size and shape of the package will need to be cognisant of fiscal\nrealities.\n\nWeek ahead offshore: In Australia, the latest consumer sentiment figures are\nout tomorrow, the monthly CPI indicator is out Wednesday, and February retail\ntrade data out Thursday. The CBA Household Spending Insights data suggested\nweakness across the month, with a small pocket of spending driven by a large\nnumber of concerts not enough to outweigh softness in areas such as household\ngoods.\n\nElsewhere it is relatively quiet with the US PCE data the only major release\nof note. The core PCE deflator is a preferred inflation gauge in the US for\nthe FOMC. Our CBA colleagues estimate a strong 0.3% lift in February both due\nto shelter and healthcare costs.\n\nAuthor:                       chris.tennent-brown@asb.co.nz\n\nASB Economics | 649 301 5657 |\n\nPlease refer to the important disclosures at the end of this document\n\n25 March 2024\n\n Currencies                 Currencies                                         Commodities                      Equities                \n NZD/USD     0.5992  0.0%   NZD/SEK                6.356   0.3%                NZX WMP           3050.0  0.8%   Dow       39476  -0.8%  \n NZD/AUD     0.9184  -0.2%  NZD/DKK                4.136   0.0%                Gold $/o          2165.4  -0.7%  S&P 500   5234   -0.1%  \n NZD/EUR     0.5558  0.2%   NZD/THB                21.8    2.5%                WTI Oil $/b       81.0    -0.6%  NASDAQ    16429  0.2%   \n NZD/JPY     90.97   0.3%   AUD/USD                0.6524  0.2%                Money Market (%)          FTSE   7931      0.6%   \n NZD/GBP     0.4777  0.4%   EUR/USD                1.081   0.0%                90 Day BB         5.64    0.00   CAC-40    8152   -0.3%  \n NZD/CAD     0.8153  0.0%   USD/JPY                151.4   0.0%                OCR               5.50    0.00   DAX       18206  0.1%   \n NZD/CHF     0.5378  -0.1%  10 Yr Bond Yields (%)          ASB Swap Rates (%)                    H.Seng  16499  -2.2%     \n NZD/HKD     4.687   0.0%   NZ                     4.54    0.01                1yr               5.34    -0.01  Nikkei    40888  0.2%   \n NZD/SGD     0.8082  -0.1%  US                     4.20    -0.07               2yr               4.84    -0.01  ASX200    7771   -0.1%  \n                                                                                                                                        \n NZD/CNH     4.360   0.0%   Aust                   4.04    -0.06               5yr               4.32    -0.02  NZX50     11979  -      \n\n ASB Economics & Research                                                      Phone           Fax             \n Chief Economist           Nick Tuffley         nick.tuffley@asb.co.nz         (649) 301 5659  (649) 302 0992  \n Senior Economist          Mark Smith           mark.smith4@asb.co.nz          (649) 301 5657                  \n Senior Economist, Wealth  Chris Tennent-Brown  chris.tennent-brown@asb.co.nz  (649) 301 5853                  \n Senior Economist          Kim Mundy            kim.mundy@asb.co.nz                                            \n Economist                 Nat Keall            nathaniel.keall@asb.co.nz      (649) 301 5915                  \n Future Me Graduate        Jordan Campbell      Jordan.campbell@asb.co.nz                                      \n Administration Manager    Caro Phillips        caro.phillips@asb.co.nz                                        \n\nhttps://reports.asb.co.nz/index.html                    ASB Economics\n\nASB North Wharf, 12 Jellicoe Street, Auckland\n\nImportant Disclaimer\n\nThis document is published solely for informational purposes.
