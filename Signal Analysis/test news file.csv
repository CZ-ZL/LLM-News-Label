2025/3/30 23:06,"BUZZ-Asia Day Ahead-Risk off - US tariffs, regional data lead","March 29 (Reuters) - In weekend news, U.S. President Donald Trump said
he is willing to make deals on tariffs; he threatened tariffs on Russian oil if
Moscow blocks a Ukraine deal, and if Iran does not make a nuclear deal, there
will be bombing. U.S. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said 'warrior' Japan is
indispensable to deter China.
    On Friday, Wall Street, Treasury yields, oil, and the U.S. dollar fell,
while metals closed mixed. 
    A negative lead for Asian markets with EM ETFs off 1.85%. India, Indonesia,
Malaysia, and Singapore are closed, and there is a public holiday in the
Philippines. NBS manufacturing PMI in China, and industrial production, retail
sales, and housing starts in Japan lead the busy regional data schedule. 
    Month-end flows, continuing negotiations on April 2nd U.S. tariffs, and
regional data in illiquid holiday markets will result in an interesting session
ahead of a busy week.
    Dow -1.69%, S&P -1.97%, and Nasdaq -2.70%, led by tech stocks, after US core
inflation firmed, while consumer sentiment and spending missed expectations. 
    Treasury yields fell on stagflation fears, caused by U.S. tariffs and
resilient inflation; 2yr -9bp to 3.908%, 10yr -11bp to 4.251% and 30yr -9bp to
4.631% on TradeWeb.
    Oil fell, Brent -0.8% and WTI -1.15% on U.S. tariff uncertainty. U.S. copper
-0.2% with risk appetite. Gold +0.9% on safe-haven demand.
    The U.S. dollar <=USD> eased 0.3%, capped by the lower Treasury yields. EUR
+0.25%, GBP steady, USD/JPY -0.85% as yield spreads tightened, USD/CNH +0.05%,
AUD -0.25%, NZD -0.35%, and USD/CAD +0.1%.

2025/3/28 10:43,UPDATE 1-Рубль в день уплаты налогов малоподвижен на MOEX и дорожает на FX,"(Внесены изменения в первом и третьем абзацах, обновлены
котировки)
       МОСКВА, 28 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль на биржевых торгах
пятницы показывает скромные отрицательные изменения с учетом
превалирования покупателей относительно дешевой инвалюты и при
невысокой активности экспортеров в день мартовских налоговых
выплат.
    Параллельно рубль показывает позитивную динамику на форексе:
игроки внешнего рынка сохраняют оптимизм в отношении перспектив
улучшения геополитической обстановки и учитывают формальную
поддержку российской валюте от близких к одномесячным максимумам
текущих нефтяных цен.
    В динамике курса рубля сегодня и в понедельник могут
находить отражение волатильные локальные денежные потоки конца
календарного месяца, в том числе со стороны не связанных с
экспортно-импортным сектором участников рынка.
    Пара юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 13.30 МСК была на
Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,45, российская валюта теряет 0,2%.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к этому времени
котировались вблизи отметок 11,96, 85,00 и 91,20 соответственно,
и рубль теряет по 0,3% к юаню и к доллару, дешевея на 0,1% в
паре с евро.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 13.30 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 83,85, и рубль набирает 0,8%. 
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> находится на форексе вблизи
отметки 90,45, и здесь рубль теряет 0,9%. 
    ""Сегодня налоговый период окончательно завершится, и курс
CNY/RUB в дальнейшем рискует вновь уйти выше отметки 11,60 рубля
за юань"", - предполагают аналитики банка Санкт-Петербург.
    В пятницу проходит Единый налоговый платеж, и в текущем
месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят окончательные расчеты с
бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе уплачивают налог на
дополнительный доход за четвертый квартал почти на полтриллиона
рублей.
    С учетом текущей высокой ключевой ставки ЦБР и явно
проявлявшихся ранее тенденций к снижению рублевого курса инвалют
сырьевые корпорации могли заранее продавать экспортную выручку,
размещая полученные рубли в краткосрочные банковские депозиты
под расчеты с бюджетом.
    ""Весьма вероятно, что экспортеры заблаговременно, уже с
середины марта, сформировали необходимый запас рублей для
прохождения крупного налогового периода. Это поясняет умеренный
рост предложения валюты накануне уплаты налогов"", - считает
Евгений Локтюхов из Промсвязьбанка.
    Параллельно на рынке сохраняется более-менее стабильный
спрос со стороны импортеров, а также частично и населения на
значительно подешевевшую в рублях иностранную валюту, что вкупе
с невысокой активностью экспортеров и отсутствием ярких
геополитических новостей помешало рублю показать существенный
рост на текущей неделе непосредственно перед налоговыми
выплатами. 
    На внешнем контуре формальной поддержкой рублю выступает
рынок нефти, где базовые сорта котируются недалеко от
одномесячных максимумов на фоне ожиданий сокращения мирового
предложения после того, как США ввели тарифы против стран,
покупающих нефть из Венесуэлы, и ввели ограничения на торговлю
иранской нефтью. 
    Североморская смесь Brent <LCOc1> дешевеет на 0,2% и
оценивается в $73,90 за баррель, а в среду она достигла отметки
$74,17 впервые с 27 февраля.

2025/3/28 8:29,Рубль в день налоговых выплат немного дешевеет на MOEX и подрастает на FX,"МОСКВА, 28 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль на торгах пятницы
немного снижается на Мосбирже с учетом баланса текущих локальных
денежных потоков, вновь получая лишь скромную поддержку от
точечных продаж экспортной выручки под сегодняшний ЕНП при
одновременно более-менее стабильном внутреннем спросе на
относительно дешевую инвалюту.
    Параллельно рубль показывает позитивную динамику на форексе:
игроки внешнего рынка сохраняют оптимизм в отношении перспектив
улучшения геополитической обстановки и учитывают формальную
поддержку российской валюте от близких к одномесячным максимумам
текущих нефтяных цен.
    Свою роль в динамике курса рубля сегодня и в понедельник
будет играть фактор конца квартала, когда могут проявляться
волатильные локальные денежные потоки на покупку или продажу
валюты, в том числе и со стороны не связанных с
экспортно-импортным сектором участников рынка.
    Пара юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 11.15 МСК была на
Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,45, российская валюта теряет 0,2%.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к этому времени
котировались вблизи отметок 11,46, 84,85 и 91,15 соответственно,
и рубль теряет 0,4% к юаню, 0,2% к доллару и показывает
минимальные изменения по отношению к евро.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 11.15 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 83,60, и рубль набирает 1,1%. 
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> находится сейчас на форексе вблизи
отметки 90,62, и здесь рубль теряет 0,7%. 
    ""Сегодня налоговый период окончательно завершится, и курс
CNY/RUB в дальнейшем рискует вновь уйти выше отметки 11,60 рубля
за юань"", - предполагают аналитики банка Санкт-Петербург.
    В пятницу проходит Единый налоговый платеж, и в текущем
месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят окончательные расчеты с
бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе уплачивают налог на
дополнительный доход за четвертый квартал почти на полтриллиона
рублей.
    С учетом текущей высокой ключевой ставки ЦБР и явно
проявлявшихся ранее тенденций к снижению рублевого курса инвалют
сырьевые корпорации могли заранее продавать экспортную выручку,
размещая полученные рубли в краткосрочные банковские депозиты
под расчеты с бюджетом.
    ""Весьма вероятно, что экспортеры заблаговременно, уже с
середины марта, сформировали необходимый запас рублей для
прохождения крупного налогового периода. Это поясняет умеренный
рост предложения валюты накануне уплаты налогов"", - считает
Евгений Локтюхов из Промсвязьбанка.
    Параллельно на рынке сохраняется более-менее стабильный
спрос со стороны импортеров, а также частично и населения на
значительно подешевевшую в рублях иностранную валюту, что вкупе
с невысокой активностью экспортеров и отсутствием ярких
геополитических новостей помешало рублю показать существенный
рост на текущей неделе непосредственно перед налоговыми
выплатами. 
    На внешнем контуре формальной поддержкой рублю выступает
рынок нефти, где базовые сорта котируются недалеко от
одномесячных максимумов на фоне ожиданий сокращения мирового
предложения после того, как США ввели тарифы против стран,
покупающих нефть из Венесуэлы, и ввели ограничения на торговлю
иранской нефтью. 
    Североморская смесь Brent <LCOc1> сейчас дешевеет на 0,4% и
оценивается в $73,73 за баррель, а в среду она достигла отметки
$74,17 впервые с 27 февраля.

2025/3/28 7:26,"FOREX-Доллар в небольшом плюсе в преддверии инфляционных данных США, ожидании новых пошлин","СИНГАПУР, 28 мар (Рейтер) - Доллар слегка укрепляется в
пятницу и может завершить неделю без сильных изменений, а также
показать снижение за квартал - опасения о возможном замедлении
экономики США из-за пошлин привели к спаду доходности
американских облигаций, акций и валюты.
    Индекс доллара к корзине из шести основных валют <=USD> к
09:05 МСК вырос на 0,07% до 104,31?.
    Евро <EUR=> снизился на 0,1% до $1,079?. 
    Единая валюта может показать самый сильный квартал за год,
укрепившись более чем на 4% с начала 2025 года благодаря
сочетанию таких факторов, как мирные переговоры по поводу
украинского конфликта, слабость доллара и скачок доходности
10-летних госбондов Германии. 
    Японская иена <JPY=> подорожала на 0,19%? до 150,76 - ее
квартальный рост может составить около 4%. 
    Валюты Скандинавии могут показать лучший квартальный
результат среди экономик G10: шведская крона <SEK=> с начала
года на данный момент поднимается примерно на 11% а норвежская
крона <NOK=> - почти на 9%. 
    Фунт стерлингов <GBP=> был малоподвижен возле
отметки $1,2937, но его рост с начала года составляет примерно
3,5%. 
    Швейцарский франк <CHF=> был стабилен на уровне 0,882?. 
    Инфляционные данные Франции и Испании будут опубликованы
позднее в пятницу, а в 13:30 выйдет, предпочитаемый Федрезервом,
индекс PCE, отражающий личное потребление в США за февраль.   
    Рост слабее 0,3% в месячном выражении, которых ожидают
опрошенные Рейтер экономисты, может оказать понижательное
давление на доллар и процентные ставки в США.
    ""Рынок нейтрализовался с точки зрения позиционирования, и
сейчас все заняли выжидательную позицию"", - сказала Махджабин
Заман из ANZ.
    ""Я полагаю, что оптимизм в отношении Европы частично прошел,
и это один из факторов, способствующих восстановлению силы
доллара"", - сказала она.
        ""Австралиец"" <AUD=> подешевел на 0,27% до $0,6286?,
торгуясь вблизи середины канала, в котором он находится с
декабря. Его подъем с начала года может составить примерно 2%.
    Премьер-министр Австралии в пятницу назначил выборы на 3
мая, а на следующей неделе состоится первое заседание нового
совета по денежно-кредитной политике ЦБ Австралии, в который
вошли два новых члена.
    ""Киви"" <NZD=> снизился на 0,45% до $0,5714?. 
    Юань на материковом рынке <CNY=D3> был малоподвижен вблизи
7,2642?, а на офшорном рынке <CNH=> - стабилен на уровне
7,2713. 
    Биткоин <BTC=> снизился на 1,26% до $86.207,93.

2025/3/28 6:30,Рубль в пятницу окончательно утратит мартовскую налоговую поддержку,"МОСКВА, 28 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль утром пятницы показывает
в целом положительные изменения на внешнем рынке с учетом
вероятности остаточных продаж экспортной выручки интрадэй под

валюта окончательно утратит ежемесячную фискальную поддержку.

    В фокусе внимания остается внешнеполитическая новостная
повестка, изменения в которой способны провоцировать
существенные колебания курса рубля. В частности, сигналы о
возможности достижения перемирия в украинском конфликте и о
попытках Москвы и Вашингтона восстановить свои отношения
выступают в текущем году основной внеэкономической поддержкой
российской валюте.

данным LSEG.
    Вчерашние торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра""
завершились на уровне 11,42 рубля за юань - российская валюта
сумела вырасти на четверть процента при объеме сделок в 78
миллиардов рублей, практически совпавшем с итоговым показателем
среды. 
    Рубль вчера при этом вторую сессию подряд котировался в
минусе значительную часть биржевых торгов при наличии
относительно скромного, но стабильного локального валютного
спроса, под занавес четверга ушедшего в тень, тогда как

        * 
      大行买需继续推高短端掉期
    

  

       路透上海3月28日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周五早盘高开逾150点，但很快回吐多数涨幅，在美国实施对等关税前，估计人民币仍将保持相对稳定；中间价则小升11点触逾一周新高，和路透预测偏离收窄至约850点，中间价整体持稳表明监管对汇率的态度一如既往。
    
    交易员表示，因大行买需旺盛，美元/人民币短端掉期今日继续大幅反弹，其中隔夜掉期<CNYTN=CFXS>回到-2点水平，短端上行也带动长端回升，助力一年期的掉期<CNY1Y=CFXS>回升至-1,973点附近。
    
    “关税快到了，可能美元/人民币偏多一点，”一外资行交易员称，“人民币动不动，关键看中间价会不会动。”
    
    
    马来亚银行则提到，外汇领域的隐含波动率已经下降，表明交易员可能减少对汇率可能大幅波动押注。
    
    市场人士也指出，中国已被美国加征20%的额外关税，对等关税框架下反而不会因为关税率过高而受额外关注。但《美国优先的贸易政策》法案以及对对华的第一阶段贸易协定进行审查结果则影响尚不明确。
    
    亦有中资行交易员称，可以利用当前低波动率机会，对人民币汇率突破7.22-7.30区间的可能性进行预防。
    
    隔夜美国公布的上周初请失业金人数有所下降，而3月失业率似乎保持稳定，这表明劳动力市场依然稳健。市场将关注焦点转向周五晚间的美国个人消费支出(PCE)物价指数，以及下周五劳工部公布的月度非农就业报告。
    
    安永高级经济学家Lydia Boussour指出，不应被美联储按兵不动的假象所麻痹，一旦经济或劳动力市场数据走弱，美联储的政策方向可能迅速转向鸽派；但若通胀数据或通胀预期上升，则可能转向鹰派。
    
    当前各方仍在权衡特朗普汽车关税举措对通胀的影响，从渥太华到巴黎的各国政府都威胁要采取报复行动。
    
    美波士顿联储总裁柯林斯周四表示，特朗普政府的关税将推动美国通胀率上升，但目前尚不清楚这种上行压力将持续多久。目前利率期货交易员仍押注美联储今年将降息三次，可能从6月开始。
    
    
    全球汇市方面，美元周五持稳，周线料将收平，但下周结束第一季时可能录得跌幅，对于关税导致美国经济增长放缓的担忧，已压低了美债收益率、美股和美元。[FRX/CN]
        
    北京时间11:50，人民币兑美元即期报7.265元，上日收报7.2655元，夜盘终报7.262元。今日人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>报7.1752元，上日为7.1763元。截至目前人民币即期成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为129.21亿美元。

    海外无本金交割远期外汇(NDF)<CNYNDFOR=>市场上，美元/人民币一年期品种<CNY1YNDFOR=>最新报在7.0915元, 上日尾盘为7.086元。香港的离岸人民币兑美元即期<CNH=D3>最新报在7.273元, 当前汇价与在岸即期价差为80点，上一交易日尾盘报7.2671元。（完）

2025/3/28 0:24,路透测算的人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>今日料开在7.2591元附近,"路透上海3月28日 - 路透根据中国外汇交易中心(CFETS)公布的人民币汇率形成机制测算，人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周五预计会开在7.2591元附近，较上日贬值约828点。

    隔夜美国公布的初请失业金数据表明劳动力市场仍稳健，目前市场仍在评估汽车关税对通胀的影响，美指<.DXY>回流而美债收益率则触及逾一个月高位；由于对等关税临近，人民币仍面临较大不确定性，监管层料保持对中间价单边势头的强力过滤，助力稳定市场预期。
    
    上日人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>收报7.2655元，而中间价则为7.1763元。根据定价机制，今日中间价变动中，有892点下跌反映市场供求影响，另有64点上涨反映的是隔夜一篮子汇率基本保持不变所需要的点数；“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。

    路透测算的上日人民币兑美元中间价为7.2728元，和外汇交易中心公布的实际值偏差965点。上日路透根据CFETS公布的中间价测算，人民币汇率CFETS指数、参考SDR（特别提款权）篮子指数和参考BIS(国际清算银行)篮子指数分别为99.04、93.21和105.36。

    上日(截至北京时间次日凌晨3点)人民币兑美元即期累计成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为411.55亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

2025/3/27 15:18,Рубль пошел в рост на фоне ослабления вечером локального валютного спроса,"(Новая редакция текста, обновлены котировки)
       МОСКВА, 27 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль показывал в четверг
смешанную динамику, утром и днем - без явного желания расти
вопреки рыночным ожиданиям его укрепления в преддверии
завтрашних налоговых выплат, однако отмечаемое участниками рынка
вечернее ослабление локального спроса на иностранную валюту
позволило рублю выйти в плюс под занавес биржевых торгов.
    Российские экспортеры при этом могли уже в предыдущие дни
реализовать значительную часть валютной выручки под предстоящие
завтра расчеты с бюджетом, но их возможные остаточные допродажи
инвалюты под пятничный ЕНП еще способны стать поддержкой рублю
до конца завтрашнего дня.  
    Пара юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 18.05 МСК была на
Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,39, российская валюта набирает 0,4%,
ранее в четверг дешевея до 11,57.
        Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к этому времени
котировались вблизи отметок 11,40, 84,60 и 91,00 соответственно,
и рубль набирает 0,7% к юаню, 0,5% к доллару и 0,6% к евро.
  
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 18.05 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 84,07, что близко от последних вчерашних значений. На
внебиржевом российском валютном рынке пара доллар/рубль к этому
времени котировалась в диапазоне 83,60-84,10, согласно
усредненным данным российских поставщиков финансовых услуг.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> находится сейчас на форексе вблизи
отметки 90,70, и здесь рубль теряет 0,3%. На российском межбанке
евро котируется в диапазоне 89,00-90,60 рубля.
    Завтра проходит Единый налоговый платеж, и в марте сырьевые
корпорации проводят окончательные расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый
год, в том числе уплачивают налог на дополнительный доход за
четвертый квартал почти на полтриллиона рублей.
    На рынке в последнее время были велики ожидания увидеть
укрепление рубля непосредственно перед ЕНП, но с учетом текущей
высокой ключевой ставки ЦБР и явно проявлявшихся ранее тенденций
к снижению рублевого курса инвалют сырьевые корпорации могли
заранее продавать экспортную выручку, далее размещая полученные
средства в краткосрочные банковские депозиты под расчеты с
бюджетом.
    На внешнем контуре поддержкой рублю выступает рынок нефти,
где базовые сорта котируются недалеко от достигнутых вчера
максимумов текущего месяца. Североморская смесь Brent <LCOc1>
показывает рост на четверть процента и оценивается в $73,93 за
баррель, а в среду она дорожала до отметки $74,17 впервые с 27
февраля. 
    В фокусе внимания также остается внешнеполитическая
новостная повестка, изменения в которой могут приводить к
существенным колебаниям курса рубля. В частности, сигналы о
возможности достижения перемирия в украинском конфликте и о
попытках Москвы и Вашингтона восстановить отношения выступают в
последние месяцы основной внеэкономической поддержкой рублю.

2025/3/27 8:38,"Юань стабилен, ЦБ Китая усилил контроль фиксинга","ШАНХАЙ, 27 мар (Рейтер) - Юань малоподвижен по отношению
к доллару в четверг - центральный банк Китая усилил контроль
фиксированного курса, а президент США Дональд Трамп
продемонстрировал некоторую гибкость по поводу возможного
снижения пошлин в отношении Китая.
    Спотовый юань в Китайской системе валютной торговли SFETS на
материковом рынке <CNY=CFXS> к 10:33 МСК не показывал ярко
выраженной динамики, торгуясь вблизи отметки 7,2656?, а на
офшорном рынке <CNH=> был малоподвижен на уровне 7,273. 
    Тем не менее перспективы юаня остаются медвежьими из-за
увеличения понижательных рисков, включая усиление напряженности
между Китаем и США после того, как Трамп объявил о введении
25-процентных пошлин на импорт автомобилей.
    Перед открытием сессии ЦБ Китая объявил срединный
фиксированный курс <CNY=PBOC> на уровне 7,1763 за доллар. При
этом значение оказалось на 965 pips (десятитысячных долей
процентного пункта) сильнее приведенного Рейтер прогноза
аналитиков, ознаменовав самое сильное расхождение более чем за
три недели. 
    Аналитики Bank of America сохранили медвежий прогноз для
юаня из-за связанных с тарифами рисков, но скорректировали 
прогноз на второй квартал до 7,5 за доллар с 7,6, поскольку
китайский регулятор продолжил объявлять срединный фиксированный
курс выше оценок.
    Трамп также сказал в среду, что готов снизить пошлины, чтобы
договориться о продаже TikTok со владельцем приложения -
компанией ByteDance.
    ""Это определенно неплохая новость, однако неопределенность
остается высокой"", - сказал Лян Дин из Macro Hive.

2025/3/27 6:41,Рубль сегодня может получать поддержку от продажи валюты под пятничный ЕНП,"МОСКВА, 27 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль утром четверга
показывает незначительные изменения на внешнем рынке в
отсутствие овернайт более-менее заметных геополитических
новостей, при этом в течение дальнейших сегодняшних торгов он
может получать поддержку от остаточных продаж экспортной
валютной выручки под пятничную уплату корпоративных налогов.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 9.30 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 83,80, и рубль набирает 0,3% от уровней закрытия среды, по
итогам которой российская валюта подорожала против американской
на две трети процента, согласно данным LSEG.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется по 90,63, и рубль
теряет четверть процента от закрытия среды, по итогам которой
российская валюта укрепилась против европейской на 0,8%.
    В текущих изменениях рублевых кросс-курсов обеих валют может
находить свое отражение текущая динамика форекса, где индекс
доллара дешевеет на треть процента (104,35) <=USD>, а евро
дорожает на 0,2% ($1,0773) <EUR=>.
    ""На валютном рынке пока все спокойно, рубль продолжает
лежать в боковике"", - сказал Алексей Антонов из компании Алор
Брокер.
    Вчерашние торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра""
завершились на уровне 11,45 рубля за юань - российская валюта
сумела вырасти на треть процента при объеме сделок в 78
миллиардов рублей. Рубль при этом значительную часть биржевой
сессии среды котировался в минусе при наличии относительно
скромного локального валютного спроса, заметного при невысокой
вчерашней активности экспортеров, но под занавес торгов ушедшего
в тень.
    Участники рынка при этом надеются увидеть сегодня и завтра
поддержку рублю от остаточных продаж экспортной валютной выручки
под пятничную уплату корпоративных налогов, хотя такие операции
сейчас стали достаточно дискретны и малопредсказуемы.
    28 марта будет проходить Единый налоговый платеж, и в
текущем месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят окончательные
расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе уплачивают налог
на дополнительный доход за четвертый квартал почти на
полтриллиона рублей.
    На внешнем контуре поддержкой рублю выступает рынок нефти,
где базовые сорта котируются недалеко от достигнутых вчера
максимумов текущего месяца. Североморская смесь Brent <LCOc1>
показывает сейчас минимальные изменения и оценивается в $73,75
за баррель, а в среду она дорожала до отметки $74,17 впервые с
27 февраля. 
    В фокусе внимания также остается и внешнеполитическая
новостная повестка, изменения в которой могут приводить к
существенным колебаниям курса рубля. В частности, сигналы о
возможности достижения перемирия в украинском конфликте и о
попытках Москвы и Вашингтона восстановить свои отношения
выступают в последние месяцы основной внеэкономической
поддержкой рублю.

2025/3/27 6:37,Asia markets mixed after Wall Street declines as markets weigh U.S. auto tariffs,"Asia markets mixed after Wall Street declines as markets weigh U.S. auto tariffsAsia-Pacific markets mixed on Thursday as investors weighed the potential fallout from Trump's announcement of 25% tariffs on car imports set to take effect on April 2. Trump also confirmed that upcoming reciprocal tariffs would remain in place throughout his second term, fueling fears of retaliation and broader economic disruptions, leading to increased currency market volatility.

Japan (NKY:IND) fell 0.95% to below 37,900, while the broader Topix Index lost 0.4% to 2,800 on Thursday, snapping a two-day rally. The Japanese yen rose toward 150 per dollar on Thursday, recouping some losses from the previous session.

Japan will not rule out countermeasures against the Trump administration's 25% tariff on U.S. car imports, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Thursday in parliament.

China (SHCOMP) rose 0.31% above 3,370, while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.35% to 10,680 on Thursday, recovering some losses from recent sessions, and the offshore yuan rose to around 7.26 per dollar on Thursday, rebounding from a three-week low hit in the previous session.

In China, industrial profits declined 0.3% in the first two months of the year, highlighting persistent deflationary pressures and escalating trade tensions with the US.

China has significantly increased debt issuance in Q1 of 2025 to stimulate growth and stabilize the bond market. The finance ministry has raised a net CNY 1.45 trillion via sovereign notes, three times more than the same period last year and a record for any first quarter, Bloomberg News said.

Caution also prevailed ahead of China's March PMI data next week.

Hong Kong (HSI) rose 0.73% to 23,824 in Thursday morning trade, extending strength for a second day amid broad-based gains.

India (SENSEX) rose 0.52% to 77,674 in early deals on Thursday, halting losses from the prior session as traders engaged in profit booking amid uncertainty over U.S. tariffs.

Traders continued to monitor developments surrounding the U.S.-India trade talks throughout the week, amid hopes of a positive result.

Australia (AS51) fell 0.38% to close at 7,969 on Thursday, ending a five-day winning streak. The Australian dollar climbed past $0.63 on Thursday, reversing losses from the previous session.

Looking ahead, the Reserve Bank of Australia is set to meet next week, with markets widely expecting it to hold interest rates steady.

In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended lower as tech stocks led a broad selloff amid mounting concerns over impending US tariffs.

U.S. stock futures fell on Thursday after President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on all foreign-made cars: Dow +0.13%; S&P 500 +0.08%; Nasdaq +0.02%.

Investors now turn their attention to Friday's PCE price index report, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure.

2025/3/27 4:16,China's yuan firms as PBOC tightens grip on currency fix,"SHANGHAI, March 27 (Reuters) - The yuan firmed against
the dollar on Thursday, as the People's Bank of China tightened
its grip on the official daily fix and President Donald Trump
showed some flexibility in reducing tariffs on China.
    However, the outlook for the yuan remained bearish in the
wake of rising headwinds, including from rising tensions with
the U.S. as Trump on Wednesday pressed on with new tariffs on
all auto imports.
    Prior to the market opening, the PBOC set the midpoint rate
<CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed to trade in a 2%
band, at 7.1763 per dollar, 965 pips firmer than a Reuters'
estimate, marking the largest gap in over three weeks. 
    Analysts at Bank of America maintained a bearish yuan
outlook due to tariff risks but adjusted their second-quarter
forecast to 7.5 per dollar from 7.6, as the PBOC continued to
set a stronger-than-expected daily fix.
    Elsewhere, Trump said on Wednesday he would be willing to
reduce tariffs to get a deal done with TikTok's Chinese parent
ByteDance to sell the short video app used by 170 million
Americans.
    ""It's definitely not bad news, but the uncertainty is still
high,"" said Liang Ding, an economist and strategist at research
firm Macro Hive.
    China's offshore yuan <CNH=D3> firmed in the morning after
weakening for seven straight days. 
    Market participants were cautiously awaiting Trump's
reciprocal tariffs deadline on April 2 to assess the shifting
risks for the Chinese currency. 
    ""Proposals from the Secretary of Commerce and the U.S. Trade
Representative regarding China's Permanent Normal Trade
Relations (PNTR) status could introduce further uncertainties to
the long-term economic relationship between the two countries,""
Ding said. 
    The dollar index <.DXY> rose to a 3-week high overnight as
investors worried the new duties on auto imports will reignite
inflation.
    The spot yuan <CNY=CFXS> opened at 7.2663 per dollar and was
last trading 71 pips firmer than the previous late session close
at 7.262 as of 0338 GMT and 1.19% weaker than the midpoint.  
    China's business environment remained dour, with industrial
profits slipping in the first two months of 2025, as firms
navigate persistent deflationary pressures and the escalating
trade war with the United States.
    The uneven economic recovery has reinforced expectations for
more policy support. Huang Yiping, an advisor to China's central
bank, said on Wednesday, that Beijing wields significant policy
room to stimulate its economy this year while some reform was
needed to boost consumption.
    The offshore yuan traded at 7.2685 yuan per dollar <CNH=>,
up about 0.15% in Asian trade.

2025/3/27 3:57,中国汇市：汽车关税落地人民币早盘横向震荡，能否摆脱区间仍有待检验,"* 
      人民币早盘小幅低开后转升
    

        * 
      中间价实际值和路透预测偏离扩至近千点
    

        * 
      4月对等关税实施在即，人民币贬值压力上升
    

        * 
      短期监管会否允许汇率贬值，还有待检验
    

  

       路透上海3月27日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周四早盘小幅低开后转升，半日波幅仅70余点；中间价则下跌9点，和路透预测偏离扩至近千点，为3月初以来最大偏离，表明外部压力上升情况下，监管也随即扩大对单边预期的过滤水平，避免市场预期恶化。
    
    交易员表示，汽车关税落地可能短期推高美元，但美国经济陷入滞胀的忧虑仍存，美元反弹幅度或受限；对人民币而言，除了关税规模，还需要考虑资本外流压力，监管是否会顺势允许人民币贬值，还有待检验。
    
    “看美元怎么走吧，人民币现在这个位置可上可下，”一外资行交易员称。
    
    
    美银认为，鉴于中国面临的新一轮关税风险，保持对人民币看跌的预期，但将二季度的人民币汇率预期从之前的7.6调整为7.5，并预计中国央行将会维持中间价的偏强水平。
    
    巴克莱最新观点指出，尽管欧元强势可能会部分缓解人民币的贬值压力，市场似乎在一定程度上忽视了关税和贸易所带来的挑战。而中美之间持续的紧张关系最终会加剧国内的通缩，并影响国内的增长前景，继续看涨美元/CNH。
        
    特朗普周三宣布从下周起对进口汽车和轻型卡车加征25%的关税，扩大了他今年重掌白宫后发起的全球贸易战，汽车行业专家预计此举将推高价格并阻碍生产。特朗普说，新关税将从4月3日开始征收，就在他计划宣布针对美贸易逆差的主要责任国征收对等关税的次日。
    
    圣路易斯联储总裁穆萨莱姆周三表示，鉴于美国经济持续增长，且仍需采取限制性政策以确保通胀率降至美联储2%的目标，目前没有迫切需要下调利率。明尼亚波利斯联储总裁卡什卡利称，在政策不确定性和关税对经济的影响持续存在的情况下，美联储应该维持现状。
    
    
    渣打银行全球G10外汇研究和北美宏观策略主管Steve Englander指出，“每个人都在试图弄清楚关税问题上会采取什么措施。”
  
    全球汇市方面，欧元兑美元周四跌至三周低点，日圆兑美元持稳。上日美国总统特朗普宣布下周起对进口汽车和轻型卡车加征25%的关税，迫在眉睫的全面贸易战削弱了风险情绪。[FRX/CN]
    
    北京时间11:31，人民币兑美元即期报7.2625元，上日收报7.2635元，夜盘终报7.2691元。今日人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>报7.1763元，上日为7.1754元。截至目前人民币即期成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为206.54亿美元。

    海外无本金交割远期外汇(NDF)<CNYNDFOR=>市场上，美元/人民币一年期品种<CNY1YNDFOR=>最新报在7.0845元, 上日尾盘为7.095元。香港的离岸人民币兑美元即期<CNH=D3>最新报在7.2691元, 当前汇价与在岸即期价差为66点，上一交易日尾盘报7.2786元。（完）

2025/3/27 1:28,中国汇市：人民币兑美元中间价小跌9点，和路透预测偏离扩至近千点,"路透上海3月27日 - 人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周四报7.1763元，较上日的7.1754元小跌9点，和路透预测偏离扩至近千点，为3月初以来的最大偏离。美国的汽车关税实施在即，美元和美债收益率重新上升，这部分加剧了人民币的贬值压力，监管层对中间价延续有保有放的思路，等待关键风险释放。
    
    人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>上日收盘报7.2635元，夜盘终报7.2691元。离岸人民币即期<CNH=D3>最新报7.2731元，上日收盘在7.2786元。稍早前路透测算今日人民币中间价大概会开在7.2728元附近，较上日贬值约974点，“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。
    

    特朗普周三宣布从下周起对进口汽车和轻型卡车加征25%的关税，扩大了他今年重掌白宫后发起的全球贸易战，汽车行业专家预计此举将推高价格并阻碍生产。特朗普说，新关税将从4月3日开始征收，就在他计划宣布针对美国贸易逆差的主要责任国征收对等关税的次日。
    
    圣路易斯联储总裁穆萨莱姆周三表示，鉴于美国经济持续增长，且仍需采取限制性政策以确保通胀率降至美联储2%的目标，目前没有迫切需要下调利率。明尼亚波利斯联储总裁卡什卡利称，在政策不确定性和关税对经济的影响持续存在的情况下，美联储应该维持现状。

2025/3/27 0:24,路透测算的人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>今日料开在7.2728元附近,"路透上海3月27日 - 路透根据中国外汇交易中心(CFETS)公布的人民币汇率形成机制测算，人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周四预计会开在7.2728元附近，较上日贬值约974点。

    关税重新成为市场关注的焦点，隔夜美元和美债收益率重新回升，人民币的外部压力有所增加，监管层料会在加码对单边预期的过滤的同时适度放松中间价的波动区间，稳定汇率同时提高弹性。
    
    上日人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>收报7.2635元，而中间价则为7.1754元。根据定价机制，今日中间价变动中，有881点下跌反映市场供求影响，另有93点下跌反映的是隔夜一篮子汇率基本保持不变所需要的点数；“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。

    路透测算的上日人民币兑美元中间价为7.2559元，和外汇交易中心公布的实际值偏差805点。上日路透根据CFETS公布的中间价测算，人民币汇率CFETS指数、参考SDR（特别提款权）篮子指数和参考BIS(国际清算银行)篮子指数分别为98.93、93.09和105.19。

    上日(截至北京时间次日凌晨3点)人民币兑美元即期累计成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为354.62亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

      美国对等关税实施临近，全球市场趋于谨慎
    

        * 
      人民币下探逾半个月低点，关税重压下贬压上升
    

        * 
      人民币汇率前景或仍可用底线思维
    

  

       路透上海3月27日 - 随着4月2日美国实施对等关税日期的临近，全球金融市场愈发谨慎，人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>下探逾半个月新低，人民币中间价<CNY=PBOC>弹性有所上升，激发了部分投资者对未来人民币将部分贬值应对高关税的猜测。
    
    也有市场人士认为，当前的关税加征幅度已然超出汇率对冲能力，全球关税战可能加剧美国滞胀的担忧反而会限制美元和美债收益率表现；从这个角度看，人民币延续以稳为主，或是更务实的应对举措。
    
    “（美元/人民币）中间价虽然近期上下幅度有点放大，但整体并没有偏离之前的波动区间，”一外资行交易员称，“从金融稳定角度看，人民币贬值应对关税，并不划算。”
    
    马来亚银行认为，到目前为止，中国似乎尚未采取强有力的报复措施，人民币也保持基本稳定；但未来中国仍可能会允许人民币贬值，以帮助缓解美国过高关税的冲击。
    
    一玩具出口商吴先生表示，美国的进口商要求他适度降价，以便共同承担关税成本，在有利润前提下，适度让利是可以的，“（但）关税已经很高了，无所谓再加多少，后面也不确定哪些国家会被征税，先等等看了，当然进口商一时半会儿也没那么容易找到合适的工厂。”
    
    巴克莱亦指出，中国采取调整贸易方向以及压缩利润等举措是无法抵消如此高的关税，何况贸易转移也没那么容易。考虑到关税对出口部门造成的损害，30%的关税可能会导致今年的中国经济增长减少约0.8-1%；若对华关税增加到60%，这一数字可能会上升到2%。
    
    “我们仍然认为人民币需要再次走弱以减轻关税的影响，可以继续做多美元/人民币，”巴克莱称。
    
    根据之前的消息汇总，4月初将是关税风险集中释放期，主要包括：4月1日美国将发布《美国优先贸易政策》备忘录审查结果，重点审查中美第一阶段经贸协议、拜登任期内301调查复审结果、中国PNTR（永久正常贸易关系）地位等。
    
    另外美国还将发布对非美的全部对等关税审查结果，4月2日特朗普将宣布对等关税政策和针对汽车、制药、半导体等特定行业关税等。
    
    美国总统特朗普将4月2日这一天称作美国经济的“解放日”。他周三宣布了承诺已久的对汽车进口加征高达25%关税的计划，扩大了他今年重掌白宫后发起的全球贸易战。特朗普并称，可能降低对华关税，以与TikTok的中国母公司字节跳动达成协议。
    
    中美经贸中方牵头人、国务院副总理何立峰周三与美国贸易代表格里尔举行视频通话。中方就美以芬太尼为由对华加征关税、有关301调查以及拟出台“对等”关税等表达严正关切。
    
    
    **人民币汇率：一动不如一静？**
    
    针对美国可能的对等关税，加拿大、欧洲等经济体均表达了将采取强力反制措施的意愿，这可能加剧美国陷入滞胀的风险。美元若延续偏弱走势，人民币的外部压力有望得到部分缓解；即便美元转为上升，人民币的调整空间估计也较为有限。

    “中间价已经稳定了一年多了，如果美元不是持续强势，人民币即期估计不会跌破7.33的前低，”一中资行交易员称。
    
    瑞穗银行亚洲首席外汇策略师张建泰称，考虑到资本外流的风险和不断恶化的国内经济增长预期，允许人民币/美元大幅贬值以配合特朗普的激进关税并非可行的选择，“人民币篮子贬值似乎是一个更有利的政策选择。”

    另有市场人士指出，得益于中国的低通胀，2023年7月以来人民币的实际有效汇率整体保持稳定，而且维持在2014年6月以来低位，显然中国商品的国际竞争力仍有优势。
        
    兴业研究则认为，中美经贸关系或面临更加复杂的前景，美国高关税不是“虚张声势”，特朗普政府储备了多种关税工具，且可叠加使用，接下来中美在金融领域摩擦风险正加大，特朗普可能将“对等”概念引入金融领域，中美汇率摩擦风险亦在上升。
    
    中国央行一季度货币政策例会要求，要增强外汇市场韧性，稳定市场预期，加强市场管理，坚决对市场顺周期行为进行纠偏，坚决对扰乱市场秩序行为进行处置，“坚决防范汇率超调风险，保持人民币汇率在合理均衡水平上的基本稳定。”

    从外部看，特朗普的关税战有可能加剧美元的调整；美国最新公布的消费者信心指数在3月份骤降至四年多来最低，反映出家庭对未来可能出现的经济衰退以及因关税引发的通胀的担忧日益加剧。
    
    招商银行金融市场部最新观点认为，“滞胀”担忧预计在4月初关税主题结束后继续发酵。（完）

The US dollar softened amid growing concerns over a slowing US economy and escalating trade uncertainties. US President Trump announced a fresh tariff, imposing a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles. This, along with reciprocal tariffs on trading partners, is set to take effect next week. In China, the central bank made waves earlier this week by signaling a shift in its monetary policy. It announced it would downplay the medium-term lending facility (MLF) rate in favor of the seven-day reverse repo rate, introducing a new bidding system for MLF loans. Additionally, the People's Bank of China plans to issue CNY 450 billion in one-year MLF loans and has hinted at potential rate cuts when deemed appropriate."

2025/3/26 23:23,BUZZ-Asia Day Ahead-Regional response to U.S. tariffs leads,"March 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday suggested
auto tariffs could run ""in the neighbourhood of 25%"". This was confirmed in a
speech after the markets closed. 
    Wall Street fell, Treasury yields, oil, and the U.S. dollar climbed, while
metals closed mixed. 
    A negative lead for Asian markets with EM ETFs off 0.6%. Japanese investment
flows lead the light regional data schedule. The focus will be on the response
to U.S. motor vehicle tariffs and the stronger U.S. dollar in Asia.
    Dow -0.3%, S&P -1.11%, and Nasdaq -2.04% after mixed data, on tariff
uncertainty, led by Nvidia and Tesla.
    Treasury yields climbed, 2yr +2bp to 4.019%, 10yr +5bp to 4.354% and 30yr
+5bp to 4.704% on TradeWeb, as Federal Reserve officials maintain there is no
rush to cut rates. 
    Oil climbed on a U.S. drawdown of crude and fuel stocks, Brent and WTI
+1.4%. U.S. copper +0.7% on tariff fears. Gold was steady, capped by the higher
USD and UST yields.

2025/3/26 15:03,Рубль в среду показывал смешанную динамику в нешироких торговых диапазонах,"МОСКВА, 26 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль в среду вновь показывал
достаточно скромную смешанную динамику при отсутствии ярких
геополитических новостей и при более-менее ровных реальных
потоках инвалюты на покупку и продажу, недостаточных по объему и
агрессивности для прорыва текущих торговых диапазонов.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 17.45 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,51, российская валюта теряет
0,2%.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к этому времени
котировались вблизи отметок 11,52, 85,20 и 91,60 соответственно,
и рубль теряет 0,2% к юаню, набирает 0,1% к доллару и дорожает
против евро на 0,4%.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 17.45 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 84,07, и рубль набирает две трети процента. На внебиржевом
российском валютном рынке пара доллар/рубль к этому времени
котировалась в диапазоне 83,50-84,10, согласно усредненным
данным российских финансовых услуг.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> находится сейчас на форексе вблизи
отметки 90,73, и здесь рубль набирает две трети процента. На
российском межбанке евро котируется в диапазоне 89,70-91,30
рубля.
    В фокусе внимания остается волатильная геополитическая
новостная повестка, в частности, может оцениваться вероятность
перемирия между Украиной и Россией в свете прошедших на текущей
неделе переговоров США с обеими сторонами конфликта, а также
последние комментарии Дональда Трампа о желании Москвы и Киева
достичь мира. 
    Участники локального валютного рынка при этом надеются
увидеть поддержку рублю от остаточных продаж экспортной валютной
выручки под пятничную уплату корпоративных налогов, хотя такие
операции сейчас стали достаточно дискретны и малопредсказуемы.
    ""Результативное завершение первой практической фазы мирных
переговоров и приближение граничных сроков уплаты довольно
крупных мартовских налогов могут привести к возобновлению, как
минимум краткосрочного, укрепления рубля"", - считает Денис Попов
из Промсвязьбанка. 
    В пятницу, 28 марта, будет проходить Единый налоговый
платеж, при этом в текущем месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят
окончательные расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе
уплачивают налог на дополнительный доход за четвертый квартал
почти на полтриллиона рублей.
    По оценке Попова из ПСБ, общий объем налогов и сборов в
марте не менее чем на четверть превысит февральские значения, с
учетом чего и при благоприятном геополитическом новостном фоне
он не исключает до конца текущей недели смещения котировок

2025/3/26 14:56,"BUZZ-FX options wrap - Volatility crush, FX direction, tariff premium","FX option implied volatility remains under heavy pressure across all currency
pairs and maturity dates, reflecting stable risk appetite and a lack of
actual/realised spot volatility.
    EUR/USD epitomises the broader FX landscape as it clings to limited ranges
near massive 1.0750-1.0800 option strikes expiring on Thursday and Friday. Its
implied volatility, like that in other major currency pairs has now almost fully
retraced the mid February-early March rallies to new medium-term highs. EUR/USD
options have also seen strong sales of low delta butterfly spreads across all
dates - typical in a low volatility environment. It's also worth noting that sub
1-month expiry risk reversals aren't currently showing any directional risk
premium. 
    GBP/USD options reflected some mild volatility risk attached to Wednesday's
UK inflation data and spring statement - but the subsequent realised volatility
proved to be very limited. The entire 1-12-month expiry curve is back at recent
lows with 1-month to 6.85 from 8.6 in early March. 
    One-week options now expire on April 2 when the U.S. trade tariff
announcements are due, but very limited implied volatility gains suggest the
market may be underpricing the related realised volatility risk. 
    Month-end and quarter-end flows favour the USD, mostly against EUR, but also
more widely according to bank models. 
    USD/TRY is being capped/contained by state banks after last week's spike,
but volatility risk premiums aren't in a rush to revert from new long-term
highs.

2025/3/26 11:27,MORNING BID AMERICAS-Temporary consumer gloom or economic doom?,"(Opinions expressed are those of the author, a columnist for
Reuters.)
    By Mike Dolan
       LONDON, March 26 (Reuters) - What matters in U.S. and
global markets today
By Mike Dolan, Editor-At-Large, Financial Industry and Financial
Markets
     
The darkest U.S. consumer confidence outlook in 12 years is
sobering, to say the least, but the big question for investors
is whether consumers actually rein in spending to match their
apparent gloom.
Today, I'll discuss this, give you an update on what else is
happening in markets and then take a look at how much of next
week's potential U.S. tariff sweep is being priced into currency
markets.
     
    Today's Market Minute
  
* The European Union's trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic met
with U.S. President Donald Trump's top trade officials on
Tuesday to try to avoid steep U.S. tariffs on EU goods next
week. 
* The United States reached separate deals on Tuesday with
Ukraine and Russia to pause their attacks at sea and against
energy targets, with Washington agreeing to push to lift some
sanctions against Moscow.
* British finance minister Rachel Reeves is expected to announce
cuts to her spending plans on Wednesday in a bid to reassure
investors that she can be trusted to fix the public finances as
growth falters.
* The Bank of Japan must raise interest rates if persistent
increases in food costs lead to broad-based inflation, Governor
Kazuo Ueda said on Wednesday.
* China wields significant policy room to stimulate its economy
this year while some reform is needed to boost consumption,
Huang Yiping, an advisor to China's central bank, said on
Wednesday.
     
    Consumer gloom or feint?
  
    With the fog thickening over next week's big U.S. tariff
announcement, financial markets are mostly in a holding pattern
as the final week of a volatile first quarter limps to a close.
    But the jury is still out on how the real economy is
absorbing the prospect of a global trade war. 
    On Tuesday, the Conference Board's March consumer survey
more than matched the worrying University of Michigan's version
for this month. Overall sentiment dropped to its lowest since
2021, and short-term expectations came in at their weakest since
2013. 
    The latter reading - which reflects the short-term outlook
for income, business, and labor market conditions - is typically
consistent with a wider economic downturn.
    But like so many economic signals of late, this one wasn't
entirely negative. The so-called labor market differential,
derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are
plentiful or hard to get, actually ticked up, indicating a
still-robust employment picture.
    Markets now have to wait to see whether hard data on actual
spending shows a pullback commensurate with the drop in
confidence. Investors have taken something of a jaundiced view
of surveys recently because the results have not yet been
matched by real world activity.
    On the trade front, it's still not entirely clear which U.S.
tariffs are coming next week, with multiple 'ifs' and 'buts'
being put forward as last minute talks continue.
    Wall Street stocks ended mixed on Tuesday. Tech stocks
outperformed again, but the S&P 500 <.SPX> barely eked out a
gain. Futures <ESc1> are back slightly in the red today.
    Treasury yields <US10YT=RR> were steady this morning after a
sharp retreat backed by Tuesday's dour confidence report and the
decent 2-year note auction. The dollar index <.DXY> was flat.
    Overseas stocks were also a mixed bag on Wednesday, with
European <.STOXXE> and mainland Chinese <.CSI300> stocks in the
red but Hong Kong <.HSI> and South Korea <.KS11> up.
    Chinese markets and the yuan <CNH=> were sideswiped by news
that the U.S. added six subsidiaries of China's leading cloud
computing and big data provider Inspur Group to the U.S. export
restriction list along with dozens of other Chinese entities.
    But the offshore yuan's drift to three-week lows is still
mostly down to tariff trepidation and expectations of further
domestic credit easing in China.
    In Europe, the big set piece of the day is Britain's latest
government budget and forecasting update, which gilt markets
have been awaiting with some anxiety. However, both UK bond
yields and sterling slipped today after news of a surprising
drop in UK inflation last month. 
    Now, let's stay in the FX markets and consider what may or
may not be priced in ahead of next week's big U.S. tariff
announcement.
     
    FX markets still suspect Trump is bluffing
  
    It's been a lousy start to the year for Wall Street, but any
notion that a global trade war is fully priced by investors
seems fanciful. Just look at currency markets.
    If you've lost track of what the U.S. administration's trade
plan is currently, then rest assured that you're not alone.
    President Donald Trump's strategy ebbs and flows by the day
amid periodic insistence that every country is going to pay,
only to revert to seemingly random exclusions or added
complexity via sectoral and national caveats. 
    Slightly punch drunk, financial markets have reverted to
behaving like a metronome: ""risk on"" with any suggestion that
Trump is hesitating and ""risk off"" with every social media post
calling for blanket U.S. trade retribution.
    As it stands, the latest nods and winks suggest the
momentous April 2 announcement will be messier than first billed
- and the pressure on stocks and bond yields has lifted a bit to
reflect that. Whether the administration's more equivocal stance
is a result of the market's tantrum in recent weeks is an open
question.   
    But it's anyone's guess what measures will eventually show
up and it's a pretty safe bet that whatever is announced will
not be the end of it.
    So is the trade war risk fully priced in? How could it be?
    
    MODELLING THREATS
    Barclays FX strategist Themos Fiotakis and team have been
brave enough to attempt to build a framework showing how
currency markets might react in a full trade war scenario. And
they reckon very little of the outsize risk is currently priced
into foreign exchange rates, either from tariffs already
announced or from those coming down the pike.
    The Barclays model works off the basic idea that tariffs
will inflate the globally-cleared price of imports in the U.S.
and that the dollar should nominally appreciate to offset the
resulting real exchange rate effects. 
    They judge the extent to which it has done so since Trump
was elected for a second term last year by the size of moves
since then that cannot be explained by economic considerations
embedded in interest rate differentials.
    Needless to say, the matrix of what's already announced,
what might be announced and what retaliatory measures are in
place or expected gets pretty complicated.  
    Numerous ""ifs"" and ""buts"" apply. Just one of many unknown
wrinkles for the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso, for example,
is the extent to which some imports will be exempt due to the
USMCA agreements struck during Trump's first term. 
    Barclays' conclusion is that of the four major currencies
under the gun, the Canadian dollar <CAD=> is reflecting the most
risk, with a 6% tariff premium already priced in. However, the
strategists argue this is still less than half of the move that
would be expected given the tariffs already in place, and even
less based on those that might yet come.
    The euro's tariff-related loss since the election of some 4%
is almost half of what might be expected given potential
tariffs, insulating it to some degree.  
    And if you take all of the worst-case scenarios, Barclays
thinks the peso <MXN=> could be at risk for further depreciation
of 38%, with a risk of a 21% decline for China's yuan <CNH=>
from here, 19% for the Canadian dollar and 9% for the euro
<EUR=>.
    Deutsche Bank emphasises differences in relative hits to the
U.S. economy and rival markets of similar-sized tariffs,
pointing out that a U.S. tariff on the euro zone would impact a
greater share of the U.S. economy than that of Europe, whereas
the opposite was true with the impact on Mexico.
    Complications aside, if you at least accept that currency
markets are far from fully priced for what's coming, then it's
unlikely stock or bond markets are much more prepared.
    To be sure, U.S. growth forecasts have been downgraded and
full-year 2025 earnings growth forecasts for S&P 500 firms have
been dragged lower. 
    Year-end S&P 500 index <.SPX> targets have been cut too -
even though consensus forecasts remain 15% above current levels.
    But if currency markets are any guide, the full blast of
what's to come has yet to be absorbed.
    While it's still possible the Trump trade threats are mostly
bluster - that's a nervy stance to cling on to as next Tuesday's
""Liberation Day"" approaches.
     
    Chart of the day 
  
Government budget day in Britain is rarely good news for the UK
government bond market, and finance minister Rachel Reeves is
under pressure again to slash government spending as economic
growth forecasts get cut again and defense requirements rise. 
     
    A Reuters poll of primary dealers projected 'gilt' issuance
of around 304 billion pounds in the next financial year - the
second-largest remit on record. Worryingly this month, 10-year
gilt yields <GB10YT=RR> have edged up relative to the U.S. and
European equivalents. But the market received some relief on
Wednesday from an unexpected drop in UK inflation in February.
     
    Today's events to watch

    * St. Louis Federal Reserve President Alberto Musalem and
Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari to speak; European

2025/3/26 9:18,Рубль в среду продолжает котироваться в смешанном режиме,"МОСКВА, 26 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль на торгах среды вновь
показывает смешанную динамику в отсутствие ярких геополитических
новостей и в ожидании более-менее крупных реальных объемов на
покупку или продажу инвалюты.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 12.00 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,53, российская валюта теряет
0,4%.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к этому времени
котировались вблизи отметок 11,55, 85,60 и 92,20 соответственно,
и рубль теряет по 0,4% к юаню и доллару, а против евро - 0,3%.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 12.00 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 84,20, и рубль набирает 0,5%. На внебиржевом российском
валютном рынке пара доллар/рубль к этому времени котировалась в
диапазоне 83,90-84,50, согласно усредненным данным российских
поставщиков финансовых услуг.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> находится сейчас на форексе вблизи
отметки 91,00, и здесь рубль набирает 0,3%. На российском
межбанке евро котируется в диапазоне 90,00-91,50 рубля.
    В фокусе внимания остается волатильная геополитическая
новостная повестка, в частности, может оцениваться вероятность
перемирия между Украиной и Россией в свете прошедших на текущей
неделе переговоров США с обеими сторонами конфликта, а также
свежие комментарии Дональда Трампа о желании Москвы и Киева
достичь мира. 
    Участники локального валютного рынка при этом еще надеются
увидеть поддержку рублю от остаточных продаж экспортной валютной
выручки по пятничную уплату корпоративных налогов, хотя такие
операции сейчас стали достаточно дискретны и малопредсказуемы.
    ""Результативное завершение первой практической фазы мирных
переговоров и приближение граничных сроков уплаты довольно
крупных мартовских налогов могут привести к возобновлению, как
минимум краткосрочного, укрепления рубля"", - считает Денис Попов
из Промсвязьбанка. 
    28 марта будет проходить Единый налоговый платеж, при этом в
текущем месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят окончательные
расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе уплачивают налог
на дополнительный доход за четвертый квартал почти на
полтриллиона рублей.
    По оценке Попова из ПСБ, общий объем налогов и сборов в
марте не менее чем на четверть превысит февральские значения, с
учетом чего и при благоприятном геополитическом новостном фоне
он не исключает до конца текущей недели смещения котировок
инвалюты к локальным минимумам, в диапазоны 11,00-11,3 рубля за
юань и 80,00-82,00 рубля за доллар. 
    На внешнем контуре поддержкой рублю может выступать рынок
нефти, где базовые сорта котируются недалеко от достигнутых
накануне трехнедельных максимумов. Североморская смесь Brent
<LCOc1> дорожает сейчас на 0,4% и оценивается в $73,46 за
баррель, а во вторник она поднималась до отметки $73,57 впервые
с 3 марта.

 (新增评论及收盘报价)
       路透上海/北京3月26日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周三收微升结束五连跌，
但盘中与离岸CNH<CNH=D3>均一度下探三周新低；中间价回到近一周高点，和路透预测偏离
则仍超800点。美国对等关税实施在即，市场情绪更趋谨慎，短期人民币料以稳为主，等待
更多指引。
    
    交易员表示，4月2日美国对等关税如何实施，将决定美元走向，人民币也可能面临新的
方向选择。跨季需求扰动银行间人民币资金价格仍偏贵，这使得美元/人民币短端掉期<CNYT
N=CFXS>继续反弹，而长端掉期的套利买需不减也让曲线变得更平。
    
    “美元能反弹多高不好说，人民币应该也没什么空间了，等4月2日关税实施后市场怎么
反应再说，”一外资行交易员称。
    
    瑞穗银行亚洲首席策略师张建泰认为，考虑到资本外流和中国经济增长预期恶化的风险
，允许人民币对美元大幅贬值以缓解关税上调压力并不是一个可行的选择，人民币一篮子贬
值似乎是更有利的政策选择，这也利于提升中国出口的竞争力。
    
    
    隔夜美国公布的消费者信心指数在3月份骤降至四年多来最低，反映出家庭对未来可能
出现的经济衰退以及因关税引发的通胀的担忧日益加剧。该调查的未来预期指数创下了12年
来的新低，并突破了与经济衰退相关的水平。

2025/3/26 7:26,"Юань у минимума 2 нед на фоне опасений о пошлинах, экономическом росте","ГОНКОНГ, 26 мар (Рейтер) - Китайский юань в паре с
долларом держится около двухнедельного минимума в среду,
оказавшись под давлением на фоне опасений о влиянии на
экономический рост пошлин США на китайские товары.
    Спотовый юань в Китайской системе валютной торговли SFETS на
материковом рынке <CNY=CFXS> к 09:50 МСК снизился на 0,07%
до?7,2645?, опустившись до минимума с 10 марта. 
    Ренминби на офшорном рынке <CNH=> подешевел на 0,13%
до 7,2736. 
    Нервозность на рынках сохранятся в преддверии следующей
недели, на которой, как ожидается, президент США Дональд Трамп
объявит о новых пошлинах на сектора автомобилей и микрочипов.  
    Экономический рост Китая, вероятно, замедлится во втором
квартале, поскольку влияние пошлин США углубляется, а эффект от
текущих стимулов ослабевает, отметил в записке для клиентов Цзюй
Ван из BNP Paribas.
    Центральный банк Китая ранее на этой неделе сообщил, что
выпустит среднесрочные кредиты на сумму 450 миллиардов юаней
сроком на один год, что немного снизит давление на ликвидность у
локальных банков.
    ""Этот нюансированный крен к смягчению денежно-кредитной
политики может усилить слабость юаня в ближайшей перспективе"".
    Перед открытием сессии ЦБ Китая объявил срединный
фиксированный курс <CNY=PBOC> на уровне 7,1754 за доллар. При
этом значение оказалось на 805 pips (десятитысячных долей
процентного пункта) сильнее приведенного Рейтер прогноза
аналитиков.

2025/3/26 6:33,Рубль утром тяготеет к росту с учетом близкого ЕНП,"МОСКВА, 26 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль утром среды показывает
положительные изменения на форексе с учетом послезавтрашнего
Единого налогового платежа, под который российские экспортеры
могут допродавать валютную выручку.
    В фокусе внимания остается и волатильная геополитическая
новостная повестка, в частности, может оценивается вероятность
перемирия между Украиной и Россией в свете прошедших на текущей
неделе переговоров США с обеими сторонами конфликта, а также
свежие комментарии Дональда Трампа о желании Москвы и Киева
достичь мира.
    Надежды на скорое завершение украинского конфликта и
ожидания улучшения отношений между Москвой и Вашингтоном с
последующей возможностью ослабления американских санкций против
России при республиканской администрации США выступают в
последние месяцы основной внеэкономической поддержкой рублю.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 9.20 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 83,65, у рубль набирает 1,2% от уровней закрытия вторника, по
итогам которого рубль подешевел против доллара на 0,9%, согласно
данным LSEG.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется по 90,60, и рубль
дорожает на 0,1% от закрытия вторника, по итогам которого
российская валюта ослабела против европейской на 0,8%.
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 11,15  против 12,19 при закрытии вторника, согласно
данным LSEG.
    Вчерашние торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра""
завершились на уровне 11,48 рубля за юань - российская валюта в
о вторник выросла на 1% при объеме сделок в 90 миллиардов
рублей, что на 1/5 меньше показателя предыдущей торговой сессии.
    Рубль накануне показал смешанную итоговую динамику при
приглушенном геополитическом новостном фоне, немного снизившим
оптимизм в отношении российской валюты на внешних рынках, но
одновременно при поддержке на локальном рынке фактора
предстоящих налоговых выплат, к которым сырьевые компании
продают экспортную выручку, при этом импортеры во вторник были
менее активны в покупках валюты, чем днем ранее.
    В пятницу пройдут налоговые выплаты, при этом в текущем
месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят окончательные расчеты с
бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе уплачивают налог на
дополнительный доход за четвертый квартал почти на полтриллиона
рублей, что еще может поддержать курс российской валюты в
ближайшие дни, однако продажи экспортной выручки под расчеты с
бюджетом достаточно дискретны и малопредсказуемы.
    На внешнем контуре поддержкой рублю выступает рынок нефти,
где базовые сорта котируются недалеко от достигнутых накануне
трехнедельных максимумов. Североморская смесь Brent <LCOc1>
дорожает на 0,1% и оценивается в $73,26 за баррель, а во вторник
она стоила $73,57 впервые с 3 марта, 
    На форексе индекс доллара оценивается в 104,34 <=USD>, что
на 0,1% выше последних вчерашних значений. Пара евро/доллар
котируется вблизи $1,0782 <EUR=>, на 0,1% ниже закрытия
вторника.
    Китайский юань теряет 0,1% на континентальном рынке КНР
(7,2645) <CNY=> и столько же - на офшорном (7,2735) <CNH=>.

2025/3/26 4:16,"Yuan wobbles near 2-week low on tariff, growth concerns","By Jiaxing Li
       HONG KONG, March 26 (Reuters) - China's yuan languished
near a two-week low against the dollar on Wednesday, pressured
by concerns over the economic impact of U.S. tariffs and the
threat of more duties on Chinese goods. 
    By 0300 GMT, the yuan <CNY=CFXS> was 0.07% lower at 7.2643
to the dollar, its weakest level since March 10.
    The offshore yuan traded at 7.2712 yuan per dollar <CNH=>,
down about 0.06% in Asian trade. 
    Markets remain on tenterhooks as they look ahead to next
week, when U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce
more tariffs targeting auto and chips industries. 
    China's economic growth is likely to moderate in the second
quarter as the U.S. tariff impact deepens and the effect of the
current stimulus fades, said Ju Wang, head of FX and rates
strategy for Greater China at BNP Paribas, in a note to clients.
    The People's Bank of China earlier this week said that it
will issue 450 billion yuan of one-year medium-term lending
facility, which will alleviate the local banks' funding
pressures slightly, she added.
    ""This nuanced monetary easing bias could add to the RMB's
near-term weakness."" 
    Prior to the market opening, the PBOC set the midpoint rate
<CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed to trade in a 2%
band, at 7.1754 per dollar, 805 pips firmer than a Reuters'
estimate.
    The Chinese yuan has risen 0.3% against the dollar this
month and is up 0.5% year-to-date, as the dollar rally loses
momentum with the fading of the U.S. exceptionalism trade. 
    The dollar's six-currency index <=USD> inched higher to
104.27 on Wednesday. It dipped to a five-month low of 103.19
last week, weighed down by worries that Trump's trade war could
trigger a U.S. recession. 
    Chinese government 10-year bond yields <CN10YT=RR> fell 0.7
basis point to 1.89%. The yield on similar U.S. government
benchmark debt was 4.3%. The yuan onshore 7-day benchmark repo
rate was at 1.94%.
Key onshore vs offshore levels:
 * Overnight dollar/yuan swap onshore -5.05 pips vs. offshore
-5.05
 * Three-month SHIBOR <SHIBOR=> 1.9 % vs. 3-month CNH HIBOR 2.1%

2025/3/26 3:43,中国汇市：人民币早盘小幅下探逾半个月新低，4月对等关税实施前市场偏谨慎,"* 
      人民币早盘创半个月，CNH触及三周低点
    

        * 
      中间价实际值和路透预测偏离仍逾800点

      跨季资金需求扰动美元/人民币短端掉期
    

  

       路透上海3月26日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周三早盘下探逾半个月新低，半日波幅仍仅50余点，离岸CNH <CNH=D3>盘中下探三周新低，中间价结束四连回到近一周高点，和路透预测偏离则仍超800点。美国对等关税实施在即，市场情绪略偏谨慎，短期人民币料以稳为主，等待更多指引。
    
    交易员表示，4月2日美国对等关税如何实施，将决定美元走向，人民币也可能面临新的选择。跨季需求扰动银行间人民币资金价格仍偏贵，这使得美元/人民币短端掉期<CNYTN=CFXS>继续反弹，而长端掉期的套利买需不减也让曲线变得更平。
    
    “美元能反弹多高不好说，人民币应该也没什么空间了，等4月2日关税实施后市场怎么反应再说，”一外资行交易员称。
    
    
    隔夜美国公布的消费者信心指数在3月份骤降至四年多来最低，反映出家庭对未来可能出现的经济衰退以及因关税引发的通胀的担忧日益加剧。该调查的未来预期指数创下了12年来的新低，并突破了与经济衰退相关的水平。
    
    招商银行金融市场部最新观点认为，近期美国公布的几项软数据依然表现疲弱，延续了上月趋势，“滞胀”担忧预计在4月初关税主题结束后继续发酵。
    
    特朗普总统反复无常的关税政策遭到了经济学家们的抨击，他们认为特朗普的关税政策造成了混乱和不确定性，使企业难以提前规划，不利于经济发展。
    
    周五的美国个人消费支出价格指数（美联储首选的通胀指标）将是重头戏。根据一致预测，该指数将保持稳定，但远高于美联储2%的目标。
    
    
    全球汇市方面，美元周三稍作喘息，美国消费者信心数据疲软和对大规模关税对美国经济增长影响的担忧，抑制了美元近期的反弹走势。[FRX/CN]
    
    北京时间11:30，人民币兑美元<CNY=CFXS>即期报7.2648元，盘中最低触及7.2653元，创3月10日以来新低，上日收报7.264元，夜盘终报7.2593元。今日人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>报7.1754元，上日为7.1788元。截至目前人民币即期成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为159.08亿美元。

    海外无本金交割远期外汇(NDF)<CNYNDFOR=>市场上，美元/人民币一年期品种<CNY1YNDFOR=>最新报在7.0925元, 上日尾盘为7.0855元。香港的离岸人民币兑美元即期<CNH=D3>最新报在7.2731元, 盘中最低触及7.2741元，创3月5日以来新低，当前汇价与在岸即期价差为83点，上一交易日尾盘报7.2664元。（完）

    2016年底CFETS进行首次货币篮子规则调整，CFETS篮子货币数量由13种调升为24种，同
时调整了相关货币权重；SDR篮子也调整了货币权重，并与CFETS货币篮子均重新定基，重新
定基日为2016年最后一个交易日。

    2019年底开始交易中心每年年末都对CFETS指数进行权重微调和重新定基，此举旨在进
一步增强指数的代表性。2024年底交易中心将CFETS指数货币篮子和权重都进行调整，篮子
货币总数增至25个。[nL4S3NW0I5]

    2022年底外汇交易中心对SDR指数货币权重进行微调。2019年底对BIS指数货币权重进行
微调；2023年底对BIS指数货币篮子和权重都进行了调整，BIS篮子货币数量调整为43种。（

2025/3/26 0:21,路透测算的人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>今日料开在7.2559元附近,"路透上海3月26日 - 路透根据中国外汇交易中心(CFETS)公布的人民币汇率形成机制测算，人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周三预计会开在7.2559元附近，较上日贬值约771点。
    
    隔夜美国公布的3月消费者信心连续第四个月下降，加上特朗普政府对关税的反复摇摆，美元和美债收益率隔夜小幅回落，人民币面临的外部压力略有缓解；但关税重压下人民币的贬值压力难消，监管层料延续对中间价单边预期的过滤举措，助力稳定市场预期。

    上日人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>收报7.264元，而中间价则为7.1788元。根据定价机制，今日中间价变动中，有852点下跌反映市场供求影响，另有81点上涨反映的是隔夜一篮子汇率基本保持不变所需要的点数；“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。

    路透测算的上日人民币兑美元中间价为7.263元，和外汇交易中心公布的实际值偏差842点。上日路透根据CFETS公布的中间价测算，人民币汇率CFETS指数、参考SDR（特别提款权）篮子指数和参考BIS(国际清算银行)篮子指数分别为98.93、93.05和105.22。

    上日(截至北京时间次日凌晨3点)人民币兑美元即期累计成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为449.83亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

Overview:? ?The US dollar is consolidating its recent gains against the G10 currencies in quiet and relatively uneventful turnover. There continue to be mixed signals about the US tariffs threatened for next week. President Trump himself said that auto tariffs were coming soon as in days, while suggesting that there may be ""a lot"" of carve-outs from the reciprocal tariffs. EU's trade representative Sefcovic is meeting with US Commerce Secretary Lutnick today and a US delegation is in India today to talk trade. The greenback mixed against emerging market currencies. The Mexican peso was the strongest yesterday, gaining 1% against the greenback and is marginally stronger today. Of note, the offshore yuan is lower for the sixth consecutive session, its longest losing streak in about 2 1/2 years and the PBOC set the dollar's reference rate higher for the fourth consecutive session. It seems to be signaling an acceptance of a weaker yuan, perhaps given the tariff threats, which were extended yesterday to include buying Venezuelan oil and gas.?

While most of the bourses in the Asia Pacific region rose, including Indonesia, where the weakness of the rupiah spurred central bank intervention today, the Hang Seng and mainland shares that trade there, tumbled more than 2%. The Stoxx 600 in Europe is trying to snap a three-day decline, while US index futures are paring yesterday's strong gains. Benchmark 10-year rates are 2-5 bp higher in Europe, while the 10-year US Treasury yield is edging higher for the third consecutive session. If sustained, it would be the longest advance this month and at 4.35%, it is the highest level since late February. Gold is firm, holding above $3000, but below yesterday's high ($3033). May WTI is extending yesterday's 1.2% advance at near $69.50 is at its best level since March 3 as it extends the rally into the fifth consecutive session.?

USD: ?The Dollar Index held last Friday's low in the yesterday's pullback and was better bid in North America. After falling from a peak near 110.20 on January 13, DXY has carved out a bottom this month near 103.20. It reached almost 104.45 yesterday and posted its highest close since March 3. It is trading firmly but quietly today between about 104.25-and 104.45. The 104.90-105.00 area still looks like a reasonable target in the coming days. Today's high frequency data includes house prices, new home sales, and the Philadelphia's Fed's non-manufacturing survey. Recall that the Philly Fed's business outlook reported last week pulled back to 12.5 from 18.1, its lowest reading in Q1. The optimism of January (44.30) has faded. The Conference Board's measure of consumer for March will be reported, but the question is not so much the direction (down) as magnitude. The University of Michigan's preliminary March measure saw sentiment fall sharply and in percentage terms, dropped the most since mid-2022. The US threat to impose 25% tariff on all imports of any country that imports Venezuelan oil or gas. In addition to the US, China India and a few Latam countries are noted buyers of Venezuelan oil and gas. The US imported 25.4 mln barrels of oil from Venezuela in Q4 25, almost a 73% increase from Q4 24. US policy is often (mis-)characterized as ""isolationist,"" but this underscores its unilateral thrust.?

EURO:? The euro was sold to a two-week low in North America yesterday near $1.0780 and made a marginal new low today. A convincing break could target $1.0700-25. The persistent dollar selling from Europe seen earlier this month, ostensibly as its record purchases of US equities last year was unwound, has eased in recent sessions. It appears to be a better two-way market in Europe. Speculators in the futures market were net long euros for the second consecutive week (in the CFTC reporting week ending March 18). They had been net short from the middle of last October. The net long position of 59.4k contracts is the most since mid-September 2024. It is a light week for eurozone data, but Germany's IFO reported a small improvement sentiment among the 9000 companies it surveyed, which echoes the improvement seen in other surveys, including yesterday's preliminary PMI. It was the third consecutive monthly increase and at 86.7, the assessment of the overall business climate is the best since last July.?

CNY: ?The dollar rose to a two-week high against the offshore yuan (~CNH7.2680) yesterday and is consolidating today. If sustained, it would be the sixth consecutive daily advance. This matches the longest advance since October 2022. It has approached the next key chart area is around today seen near CNH7.2725. The PBOC set the dollar's reference rate at CNY7.1788 (CNY7.1780 yesterday). It is the fourth consecutive session that fix has been raised and its highest level in a couple of months. This gives the dollar more a little more scope to appreciate. One cannot help but suspect the PBOC is signaling a change. Also, coming out of its first meeting of the year, the PBOC renewed its commitment to cut rates and reserve requirements but does not seem to be in a hurry to do so.

JPY:? Firmer US Treasury yields and a slightly wider US 10-year premium over Japan helped lift keep the dollar bid against the yen yesterday and settled above JPY150 for the first time this month. The gains were extended those gains today to about JPY150.95, its best level since March 3. It stalled but held above JPY150.40 on the pullback. Provided the JPY150 area holds, the next technical target is the month's high near JPY151.30. The five-day moving average crossed above the 20-day moving average in the middle of last week, for the first time since mid-January. Expectations for the BOJ have not changed much despite the softer real sector data. The market may be more sensitive to the March Tokyo CPI at the end of the week. The headline is expected to soften for the second consecutive month. The core measures look flat.

GBP:? ?Sterling traded on both sides of last Friday's range yesterday by a couple hundredths of a cent and settled little changed and within pre-weekend range. Still, it was rebuffed last week after poking above $1.30 and looks to be rolling over. It is consolidating quietly today in less than a third-of-a-cent range today above $1.29. The next support area is seen in the $1.2840-$1.2860 area. Tomorrow is an important day for the UK, rates, and sterling. February CPI is due and is expected to jump 0.5%. However, given the base effect, the year-over-year rate may be steady at 3.0%, while the core and services inflation may slow slightly. The focus is also on fiscal policy. The Office for Budget Responsibility will update its forecasts. It will likely recognize that the economy is weaker than it previously projected. This translates into a larger budget deficit and requires a response from Chancellor Reeves. The Labour government seems more inclined to cut welfare than boost taxes or embrace a larger shortfall.

CAD:? ?The US dollar was sold to a three-day low yesterday, slightly below CAD1.4300. Last week's low was near CAD1.4270 and that is roughly where the lower end of the triangle pattern is seen. This month's low was closer to CAD1.4240. The greenback is in a narrow range today (~CAD1.4310-CAD1.4335). Carney is taking the Liberal Party in a more pro-business direction. To outflank his call to reduce the lowest income bracket by one percentage point to 14%, the Conservative leader Poilievre has promised a 2.35 percentage point cut. Both candidates are advocating more defense and infrastructure spending. Both candidates will likely generate a larger budget deficit, but this is not as pressing an issue as it may be in some other G10 countries. Last year's fiscal shortfall was 2% of GDP and was anticipated to fall to around 1.3% this year. Tensions with the US and housing and health care affordability seem more salient.

AUD: ?While sterling had an outside day, the Australian dollar recorded an inside day yesterday as it was confined to the pre-weekend range. It is trading inside yesterday's range so far today (~$0.6280-$0.6295). It had been turned back from $0.6400 last week and encountered selling pressure in the past two sessions a little above $0.6300. A break of the $0.6260 area could see a return to the month's low, slightly below $0.6200. The first thing tomorrow, Australia reports February CPI. It looks flat at 2.5% year-over-year. It is possible that the trimmed mean measure ticks down. Regardless of the details, a cut next week (April 1) remains unlikely. The central bank puts more weight on the quarterly reading, and the Q1 report is due at the end of April. The futures market is discounting a little more than a 70% chance of a cut at the May 20 meeting, the last one in H1 25.?

MXN:? The Mexican peso was the strongest emerging market currency yesterday, gaining about 1%. This recouped 2/3 of last week loss, which was the largest weekly decline in two months. The peso edged a little higher today, but the greenback has held (barely) above MXN20.00. The peso's gains were impressive not only because of the US dollar's broader strength, but also in the context of (slightly) softer than expected CPI for the first half of March and the continued weakness in January's IGAE monthly indicator (similar to a monthly GDP). It has fallen for three of the past four months. The combination of the peso's resilience and the data makes a 50 bp rate cut later this week less debatable. Meanwhile, the dollar recorded the lows for Q1 25 last week near BRL5.6320. It brings a three day-advance into today. It settled slightly below BRL5.7650 yesterday to resurface above the 20-day moving average (~BRL5.7640) for the first time since March 13. Nearby resistance extended from BRL5.7750 to BRL5.8100.

The Office for Budget Responsibility will update its forecasts. It will likely recognize that the economy is weaker than it previously projected. This translates into a larger budget deficit and requires a response from Chancellor Reeves. The Labour government seems more inclined to cut welfare than boost taxes or embrace a larger shortfall.

CAD:? ?The US dollar was sold to a three-day low yesterday, slightly below CAD1.4300. Last week's low was near CAD1.4270 and that is roughly where the lower end of the triangle pattern is seen. This month's low was closer to CAD1.4240. The greenback is in a narrow range today (~CAD1.4310-CAD1.4335). Carney is taking the Liberal Party in a more pro-business direction. To outflank his call to reduce the lowest income bracket by one percentage point to 14%, the Conservative leader Poilievre has promised a 2.35 percentage point cut. Both candidates are advocating more defense and infrastructure spending. Both candidates will likely generate a larger budget deficit, but this is not as pressing an issue as it may be in some other G10 countries. Last year's fiscal shortfall was 2% of GDP and was anticipated to fall to around 1.3% this year. Tensions with the US and housing and health care affordability seem more salient.

AUD: ?While sterling had an outside day, the Australian dollar recorded an inside day yesterday as it was confined to the pre-weekend range. It is trading inside yesterday's range so far today (~$0.6280-$0.6295). It had been turned back from $0.6400 last week and encountered selling pressure in the past two sessions a little above $0.6300. A break of the $0.6260 area could see a return to the month's low, slightly below $0.6200. The first thing tomorrow, Australia reports February CPI. It looks flat at 2.5% year-over-year. It is possible that the trimmed mean measure ticks down. Regardless of the details, a cut next week (April 1) remains unlikely. The central bank puts more weight on the quarterly reading, and the Q1 report is due at the end of April. The futures market is discounting a little more than a 70% chance of a cut at the May 20 meeting, the last one in H1 25.?

MXN:? The Mexican peso was the strongest emerging market currency yesterday, gaining about 1%. This recouped 2/3 of last week loss, which was the largest weekly decline in two months. The peso edged a little higher today, but the greenback has held (barely) above MXN20.00. The peso's gains were impressive not only because of the US dollar's broader strength, but also in the context of (slightly) softer than expected CPI for the first half of March and the continued weakness in January's IGAE monthly indicator (similar to a monthly GDP). It has fallen for three of the past four months. The combination of the peso's resilience and the data makes a 50 bp rate cut later this week less debatable. Meanwhile, the dollar recorded the lows for Q1 25 last week near BRL5.6320. It brings a three day-advance into today. It settled slightly below BRL5.7650 yesterday to resurface above the 20-day moving average (~BRL5.7640) for the first time since March 13. Nearby resistance extended from BRL5.7750 to BRL5.8100.

новостном фоне, немного снизившем оптимизм в отношении
российской валюты на внешних рынках, но одновременно при
поддержке на локальном рынке фактора предстоящих налоговых
выплат, к которым сырьевые компании продают экспортную выручку.

валютном рынке пара доллар/рубль к этому времени котировалась в
диапазоне 84,00-84,50, согласно усредненным данным российских
поставщиков финансовых услуг.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> находится сейчас на форексе вблизи
отметки 91,48, и здесь рубль теряет 1%. На российском же
межбанке евро котируется в диапазоне 90,35-91,90 рубля.
    ""Техническая картина по рублю остается сильной и устойчивого
разворота (рублевого) курса доллара вверх пока не
прослеживается"", - отмечает Александр Потавин из ФГ Финам.
    Сегодня давление на внешние котировки рубля могло оказать
отсутствие официальных итогов вчерашних переговоров США и РФ,
тогда как поддержкой на локальном рынке выступают ожидания
допродаж экспортной выручки под предстоящие в пятницу расчеты с
бюджетом.
    Пресс-секретарь российского президента Дмитрий Песков
сегодня сообщил, что итоги российско-американских переговоров в
Эр-Рияде сейчас анализируются обеими сторонами, но раскрываться
их содержание не будет. Также, по словам Пескова, разговор на
высшем уровне между президентом РФ Владимиром Путиным и
президентом США Дональдом Трампом пока не запланирован, но при
необходимости он может быть оперативно организован.
    ""Геополитический фон пока не располагает к выраженному
укреплению российской валюты. В отсутствие негативных
геополитических новостей курс к концу недели все же способен
уйти к 11,30 рубля за юань на фоне налогового периода"", -
полагают аналитики банка Санкт-Петербург.
    В ближайшую пятницу будет проходить Единый налоговый платеж,
при этом в текущем месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят
окончательные расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе
уплачивают налог на дополнительный доход за четвертый квартал
почти на полтриллиона рублей, что еще может поддержать курс
российской валюты в ближайшие дни, однако продажи экспортной
выручки под расчеты с бюджетом достаточно дискретны и
малопредсказуемы.
    На внешнем контуре поддержкой рублю выступает рынок нефти,
где базовые сорта котируются вблизи свежих трехнедельных
максимумов. Североморская смесь Brent <LCOc1> сегодня достигла
отметки 73,57 впервые с 3 марта, сейчас она дорожает на 0,4% и
оценивается в $73,28 за баррель после роста накануне более чем
на 1% на фоне решения Дональда Трампа ввести 25-процентные
пошлины при торговле с США для стран, импортирующих нефть и газ
из Венесуэлы.
    По мнению Александра Потавина из Финама, безотносительно
геополитики и динамики нефти апрель обычно является одним из
наиболее благоприятных для рубля месяцем в году согласно
статистике прошлых лет, в том числе и с учетом сезонно низкого
спроса на иностранную валюту. 
    По его мнению, американская валюта в следующем месяце будет
торговаться в диапазоне 82,00-88,00 рубля, а китайская валюта -
в пределах отметок 11,30-12,00 рубля за юань.

2025/3/25 14:50,"BUZZ-FX options wrap-Neutral EUR, huge 1.0800, GBP risk, AUD value","March 25 (Reuters) - G10 FX Option implied volatility maintains its
drift lower across all expiry dates amid a lack of realised volatility or
near-term directional catalysts. While there is potential value when compared to
past realised volatility measures in some currency pairs and expiry dates, there
has been no rush to initiate new long positions.
    Benchmark 1-month expiry EUR/USD implied volatility extends its setback from
mid-March highs at 9.25 to 7.4. Interestingly, the 1-month 25 delta risk
reversals have since reverted to a neutral bias, having fallen from new multi-
year highs for topside strikes on March 10-11, to 0.25 for downside strikes last
week. Huge 1.0750 and 1.0800 strikes expire on Thursday and Friday, with related
hedging flows providing a potential draw if FX remains nearby. 
    USD/JPY 1-month implied volatility has now almost fully retraced its
February 1 to March 11 rally from 9.25 to 12.4. One-month risk reversals have
seen their JPY call over put implied volatility premium revert to 1.2 from 1.85.
    Overnight expiry GBP related implied volatility opened higher on Tuesday as
its expiry now includes a wealth of UK inflation data and the eagerly awaited
Spring statement from the UK Government Chancellor. Those gains were not
significant but stand out against a low volatility back-drop and should warn
against complacency.
    AUD/USD 1-month expiry matches recent setback lows at 9.25 and is one of
those contracts that might offer value when compared with its past realised
volatility measures.

2025/3/25 11:03,"FX Market Calm on the Surface, Angst Below","FX Market Calm on the Surface, Angst BelowMar 25, 2025

Overview:?The US dollar is consolidating its recent gains against the G10 currencies in quiet and relatively uneventful turnover. There continue to be mixed signals about the US tariffs threatened for next week. President Trump himself said that auto tariffs were coming soon as in days, while suggesting that there may be ""a lot"" of carve-outs from the reciprocal tariffs. EU's trade representative Sefcovic is meeting with US Commerce Secretary Lutnick today and a US delegation is in India today to talk trade. The greenback mixed against emerging market currencies. The Mexican peso was the strongest yesterday, gaining 1% against the greenback and is marginally stronger today. Of note, the offshore yuan is lower for the sixth consecutive session, its longest losing streak in about 2 1/2 years and the PBOC set the dollar's reference rate higher for the fourth consecutive session. It seems to be signaling an acceptance of a weaker yuan, perhaps given the tariff threats, which were extended yesterday to include buying Venezuelan oil and gas.?

While most of the bourses in the Asia Pacific region rose, including Indonesia, where the weakness of the rupiah spurred central bank intervention today, the Hang Seng and mainland shares that trade there, tumbled more than 2%. The Stoxx 600 in Europe is trying to snap a three-day decline, while US index futures are paring yesterday's strong gains. Benchmark 10-year rates are 2-5 bp higher in Europe, while the 10-year US Treasury yield is edging higher for the third consecutive session. If sustained, it would be the longest advance this month and at 4.35%, it is the highest level since late February. Gold is firm, holding above $3000, but below yesterday's high ($3033). May WTI is extending yesterday's 1.2% advance at near $69.50 is at its best level since March 3 as it extends the rally into the fifth consecutive session.?

USD:The Dollar Index held last Friday's low in the yesterday's pullback and was better bid in North America. After falling from a peak near 110.20 on January 13, DXY has carved out a bottom this month near 103.20. It reached almost 104.45 yesterday and posted its highest close since March 3. It is trading firmly but quietly today between about 104.25-and 104.45. The 104.90-105.00 area still looks like a reasonable target in the coming days. Today's high frequency data includes house prices, new home sales, and the Philadelphia's Fed's non-manufacturing survey. Recall that the Philly Fed's business outlook reported last week pulled back to 12.5 from 18.1, its lowest reading in Q1. The optimism of January (44.30) has faded. The Conference Board's measure of consumer for March will be reported, but the question is not so much the direction (down) as magnitude. The University of Michigan's preliminary March measure saw sentiment fall sharply and in percentage terms, dropped the most since mid-2022. The US threat to impose 25% tariff on all imports of any country that imports Venezuelan oil or gas. In addition to the US, China India and a few Latam countries are noted buyers of Venezuelan oil and gas. The US imported 25.4 mln barrels of oil from Venezuela in Q4 25, almost a 73% increase from Q4 24. US policy is often (mis-)characterized as ""isolationist,"" but this underscores its unilateral thrust.?

EURO:The euro was sold to a two-week low in North America yesterday near $1.0780 and made a marginal new low today. A convincing break could target $1.0700-25. The persistent dollar selling from Europe seen earlier this month, ostensibly as its record purchases of US equities last year was unwound, has eased in recent sessions. It appears to be a better two-way market in Europe. Speculators in the futures market were net long euros for the second consecutive week (in the CFTC reporting week ending March 18). They had been net short from the middle of last October. The net long position of 59.4k contracts is the most since mid-September 2024. It is a light week for eurozone data, but Germany's IFO reported a small improvement sentiment among the 9000 companies it surveyed, which echoes the improvement seen in other surveys, including yesterday's preliminary PMI. It was the third consecutive monthly increase and at 86.7, the assessment of the overall business climate is the best since last July.?

CNY:The dollar rose to a two-week high against the offshore yuan (~CNH7.2680) yesterday and is consolidating today. If sustained, it would be the sixth consecutive daily advance. This matches the longest advance since October 2022. It has approached the next key chart area is around today seen near CNH7.2725. The PBOC set the dollar's reference rate at CNY7.1788 (CNY7.1780 yesterday). It is the fourth consecutive session that fix has been raised and its highest level in a couple of months. This gives the dollar more a little more scope to appreciate. One cannot help but suspect the PBOC is signaling a change. Also, coming out of its first meeting of the year, the PBOC renewed its commitment to cut rates and reserve requirements but does not seem to be in a hurry to do so.

JPY:Firmer US Treasury yields and a slightly wider US 10-year premium over Japan helped lift keep the dollar bid against the yen yesterday and settled above JPY150 for the first time this month. The gains were extended those gains today to about JPY150.95, its best level since March 3. It stalled but held above JPY150.40 on the pullback. Provided the JPY150 area holds, the next technical target is the month's high near JPY151.30. The five-day moving average crossed above the 20-day moving average in the middle of last week, for the first time since mid-January. Expectations for the BOJ have not changed much despite the softer real sector data. The market may be more sensitive to the March Tokyo CPI at the end of the week. The headline is expected to soften for the second consecutive month. The core measures look flat.

GBP:?Sterling traded on both sides of last Friday's range yesterday by a couple hundredths of a cent and settled little changed and within pre-weekend range. Still, it was rebuffed last week after poking above $1.30 and looks to be rolling over. It is consolidating quietly today in less than a third-of-a-cent range today above $1.29. The next support area is seen in the $1.2840-$1.2860 area. Tomorrow is an important day for the UK, rates, and sterling. February CPI is due and is expected to jump 0.5%. However, given the base effect, the year-over-year rate may be steady at 3.0%, while the core and services inflation may slow slightly. The focus is also on fiscal policy. The Office for Budget Responsibility will update its forecasts. It will likely recognize that the economy is weaker than it previously projected. This translates into a larger budget deficit and requires a response from Chancellor Reeves. The Labour government seems more inclined to cut welfare than boost taxes or embrace a larger shortfall.

CAD:?The US dollar was sold to a three-day low yesterday, slightly below CAD1.4300. Last week's low was near CAD1.4270 and that is roughly where the lower end of the triangle pattern is seen. This month's low was closer to CAD1.4240. The greenback is in a narrow range today (~CAD1.4310-CAD1.4335). Carney is taking the Liberal Party in a more pro-business direction. To outflank his call to reduce the lowest income bracket by one percentage point to 14%, the Conservative leader Poilievre has promised a 2.35 percentage point cut. Both candidates are advocating more defense and infrastructure spending. Both candidates will likely generate a larger budget deficit, but this is not as pressing an issue as it may be in some other G10 countries. Last year's fiscal shortfall was 2% of GDP and was anticipated to fall to around 1.3% this year. Tensions with the US and housing and health care affordability seem more salient.

It is trading inside yesterday's range so far today (~$0.6280-$0.6295). It had been turned back from $0.6400 last week and encountered selling pressure in the past two sessions a little above $0.6300. A break of the $0.6260 area could see a return to the month's low, slightly below $0.6200. The first thing tomorrow, Australia reports February CPI. It looks flat at 2.5% year-over-year.

международным делам, одного из участников российской делегации
Григория Карасина.
    Помимо геополитики, динамику курса рубля определяют реальные
денежные потоки, в частности, продажа экспортной выручки под
предстоящую уплату налогов и спрос импортеров на значительно
подешевевшую за последнее время иностранную валюту, рублевые
котировки которой остаются вблизи многомесячных минимумов.
    В ближайшую пятницу будет проходить Единый налоговый платеж,
при этом в текущем месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят
окончательные расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе
уплачивают налог на дополнительный доход за четвертый квартал
почти на полтриллиона рублей, что еще может поддержать курс
российской валюты в ближайшие дни, однако продажи экспортной
выручки под расчеты с бюджетом достаточно дискретны и
малопредсказуемы.
    ""Геополитический фон пока не располагает к выраженному
укреплению российской валюты. В отсутствии негативных
геополитических новостей курс к концу недели все же способен
уйти к 11,30 рубля за юань на фоне налогового периода"", -
полагают аналитики банка Санкт-Петербург.
    На внешнем контуре поддержкой рублю выступает рынок нефти,
где базовые сорта котируются вблизи свежих трехнедельных
максимумов. Североморская смесь Brent <LCOc1> дорожает на 0,4% и
оценивается в $73,30 за баррель после роста накануне более чем
на 1% на фоне решения Дональда Трампа ввести 25-процентные
пошлины при торговле с США для стран, импортирующих нефть и газ
из Венесуэлы.

 (新增评论及收盘报价)
       路透上海/北京3月25日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周二收跌120点创半个月新
低，中间价则四连跌刷新逾两个月新低，较路透预测偏离扩至近850点。交易员称，美元延
续反弹态势，而4月初美国对等关税政策落地也扰动市场情绪，人民币继续小幅调整态势，
预计短期维持偏弱走势。
    
    一中资行交易员表示，除了美指持续反弹外，市场开始忧心美国对等关税实施后对贸易
的影响，人民币承压走弱。    
       
    “短期美元/人民币就是跟着美元走，目前看美元还是有些反弹的空间，”一中资行交
易员称，“中间价也有一点点动，人民币慢慢贬。”      
    
    
    美国总统特朗普最新表示，很可能在4月2日实施对等征税时排除一系列针对特定行业的
关税，但特朗普政府的一位官员周一警告说，情况仍可能变化，尚未做出最终决定。华尔街
认为，此举表明他在这个数周以来搅动市场的问题上表现出了灵活性。  
      
    巴克莱银行最新报告称，美国加征关税举措对中国而言是“一颗难以咽下的药丸”；虽
然人工智能技术的发展有望提振中国经济增长，但不太可能抵消关税对经济的冲击。
    
    “我们仍然认为，鉴于出口商利润下滑以及贸易转移空间优先，人民币需要再次走弱一
对冲关税的不利影响，”报告称。
    
    花旗最新观点指出，美债收益率回升是人民币承压的关键，另外日圆走弱至150关口下
方，也会拖累离岸CNH；另外期权角度看，在4月2日美国新一轮关税宣布前，市场对人民币
看跌的押注持续增长。
    
    招商银行金融市场部认为，近期美元反弹有经济数据、欧洲利好兑现，关税临近等因素
，在下周关税落地之前，还是需要警惕美元继续反弹。“但关税是不是再被豁免和延期也存
在变数，这会限制反弹的幅度。”       

    今年大部分时间里，美元一直承受着压力，市场对特朗普将迅速出台有利于增长的政策
的假设转变成了对贸易关税实施和最终影响的担忧。美国商品期货交易委员会(CFTC)上周五
公布的数据显示，投机客上周对美元转为净看跌，为10月以来首次。

2025/3/25 8:31,Asia-Pacific markets mostly advance mirroring Wall Street gains amid tariff optimism,"Asia-Pacific markets mostly advance mirroring Wall Street gains amid tariff optimismAsia-Pacific markets mostly higher on Tuesday mirrored an upbeat session on Wall Street overnight amid optimism that the Trump administration may adopt a more targeted approach to tariffs, easing tariff concerns.

Meanwhile, investors await clarity on Trump's reciprocal tariffs next week, with uncertainty over the size of the duties and targeted countries.

Japan (NKY:IND) rose 0.45% above 38,000, while the broader Topix Index climbed 0.7% to 2,810 on Tuesday, with the latter approaching an eight-month-high. The Japanese yen remained weak at around 150.7 per dollar on Tuesday, hovering near a three-week low.

Domestically, minutes from the Bank of Japan's January meeting showed that policymakers remain open to additional interest rate hikes, depending on wage growth and inflation trends. One member suggested the policy rate could reach 1% in the second half of fiscal 2025.

China (SHCOMP) rose 0.04% to 3,367, while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.6% to 10,635 on Tuesday, and the offshore yuan extended its decline to around 7.27 per dollar, hovering near two-week lows, pressured by growing concerns over the effectiveness of China's stimulus measures in offsetting new US tariffs.

On the monetary policy front, the People's Bank of China is changing its monetary policy by prioritizing the seven-day reverse repo rate over the medium-term lending facility rate. This move, while intended to manage liquidity, introduces uncertainty about borrowing costs. The central bank plans to issue significant MLF loans and has hinted at potential future rate cuts, which is putting downward pressure on the yuan.

China's fiscal revenue declined by 1.6% from a year earlier in the first two months of 2025, reversing a 1.3% increase in 2024. Meanwhile, government spending rose 3.4%, slightly easing from a 3.6% rise last year.

China recently set a 5% GDP growth target and raised its deficit to a three-decade high while announcing plans to boost consumption and domestic demand.

Hong Kong (HSI) fell 1.99% to 23,417 on Tuesday morning, reversing gains from the prior session amid concerns over U.S. recession risks and China's deflation threat.

India (SENSEX) rose 0.73% to 78,630 in morning deals on Tuesday, rising for the seventh straight session and hitting their highest level since early January, mainly boosted by strong performances in the tech, financial services, and banking sectors.

Australia (AS51) rose 0.05% surpassing 7,980 to reach its highest level in over two weeks. The Australian dollar remained steady at $0.628 on Tuesday, remaining sideways so far this week, as investors awaited the government's general budget announcement.

Meanwhile, markets anticipate no changes in monetary policy when the Reserve Bank of Australia meets next week.

In the U.S., on Monday, all three major indexes ended higher driven by signs that U.S. trade sanctions may be less severe than feared, including President Trump's suggestion that some countries could receive exemptions.

U.S. stock futures drifted lower on Tuesday after Fed Bostic projected only one rate cut this year, citing rising inflation due to tariff concerns: Dow -0.20%; S&P 500 -0.22%; Nasdaq -0.23%.

Currencies: (JPY:USD), (CNY:USD), (AUD:USD), (INR:USD), (HKD:USD), (NZD:USD).

10 марта в 7,2650 за доллар.
    На офшорном рынке ренминби <CNH=> также не показывал ярко
выраженной динамики, удерживаясь на уровне 7,2657.

Значение оказалось на 842 pips (десятитысячных долей процентного
пункта) сильнее приведенного Рейтер прогноза аналитиков - самое
значительное расхождение за две недели, указывающее на попытки
центробанка усилить контроль над слабеющей валютой.
    ""Валюта колебалась между ростом и снижением на фоне новостей

пошлины начнут действовать с 2 апреля, а некоторые страны могут
рассчитывать на отсрочку.

2025/3/25 8:06,人民币衍生品：境内美元/人民币掉期曲线走平，跨季需求不减短端买需旺盛,"路透上海3月25日 - 季末临近使得中国银行间市场资金价格上行，机构对人民币的需求不减，而境内美元流动性均衡偏松，使得美元/人民币短端掉期<CNYTN=CFXS>回升明显，预计跨季之前短端掉期保持偏强；而美元走强推低离岸CNH<CNH=D3>，不过离岸人民币流动性<CNHTN=>暂并未收紧。
    
    交易员并表示，美债收益率反弹，而中国央行改变中期借贷便利（MLF）的招标方式，中国国债收益率下跌，中美负利差有所走扩，长端掉期<CNY1Y=CFXS>盘中回落至-2,050点附近，但套利买盘涌现，使得长端掉期收复部分跌幅，预计长端掉期仍将维持区间宽幅震荡。
    
    “短端掉期买盘很强，应该是机构缺人民币，长端的卖盘不少的，掉期曲线很平，”一中资行交易员称。
    
    
    
    另一外资行交易员表示，买长卖短操作仍有一定套利空间，跨季之前还是可以操作。
    
    中国央行周一意外提前预告3月中期借贷便利（MLF）放量续做，同时还改变了MLF招标方式，银行间债市周二早盘现券和期货一度明显走暖，10年国债收益率盘中亦跌破1.8%。
    
    分析人士称，招标方式的调整标志着MLF与政策利率彻底脱钩，MLF今后单纯作为结构性货币政策工具与市场利率接轨，成本有望下降，效果类似于结构性降息。
    
    澳新银行中国市场经济学家邢兆鹏指出，此次央行净投放加上人民币中间价走软，以及此前发布的央行货币政策例会，表明由于即将到来的关税冲击，政策基调将从鹰派转向中性。“如果（美国）加征关税，我们不能排除定向降准和降息的可能性。”
    
    美国总统特朗普最新表示，很可能在4月2日实施对等征税时排除一系列针对特定行业的关税，但特朗普政府的一位官员周一警告说，情况仍存变数，尚未做出最终决定。华尔街认为，此举表明他在这个数周以来搅动市场的问题上表现出了灵活性。
    
    
    市场人士认为，美国更具针对性的关税措施缓解了部分市场压力，但由于政策和经济方向仍不明朗，因此美国债市仍限于本月大部分时间的窄幅区间内。
    
    北京时间15:55，境内美元/人民币隔夜期掉期<CNYON=CFXA>报-4.65点，一周期掉期<CNYSW=CFXA>报-33点，一个月期<CNY1M=CFXA>报-153.5点，一年期<CNY1Y=CFXA>报-2,021点，上周五收盘四个期限掉期点分别收在-14.3点、-32.9点、-149点和-1,970点。
    
    根据利率平价模型，多数情况下美元/人民币掉期点与中美利差正相关，即当中美利差扩大时，美元/人民币掉期点相应上涨，反之亦然；其中一年期掉期走势是美元/人民币掉期市场的重要标杆。（完）

2025/3/25 6:33,Рубль утром малоподвижен в ожидании новых вводных,"МОСКВА, 25 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль утром вторника
показывает минимальные изменения на форексе в ожидании новых
вводных во внешнеполитической повестке после вчерашних
переговоров США и РФ, по итогам которых ожидается позитивное
заявление, о чем Рейтер сообщил источник в Белом доме.
    Надежды на скорое завершение украинского конфликта, а также
ожидания улучшения отношений между Москвой и Вашингтоном с
последующей возможностью ослабления американских санкций против
России при республиканской администрации США выступают в текущем
году основной внеэкономической поддержкой рублю.
    На внутреннем валютном рынке после открытия торгов Мосбиржи
динамику курса рубля будут также определять реальные денежные
потоки, в частности, продажа экспортной выручки под пятничную
уплату налогов и спрос импортеров на значительно подешевевшую за
последнее время иностранную валюту, рублевые котировки которой
остаются вблизи многомесячных минимумов.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 9.30 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 83,90, рядом с уровнями закрытия понедельника, по итогам
которого рубль подорожал против доллара на 0,7%, согласно данным
LSEG.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется по 90,60, также близко
от последних значений понедельника, по итогам которого
российская валюта подорожала против европейской на 0,9%.
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 12,19, что совпадает с последними вчерашними
показателями LSEG.
    Вчерашние же торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами
""завтра"" завершились на уровне 11,60 рубля за юань - российская
валюта в итоге подешевела на 1,2% при объеме сделок в 114
миллиардов рублей.
    В котировках рубля на форексе вчера положительно отражались
ожидания улучшения геополитической ситуации, тогда как на
внутреннем рынке свою роль в его итоговом ослаблении сыграло
смещение баланса потоков в пользу покупателей иностранной
валюты, с лихвой переваривших все предложение экспортной
выручки.
    В ближайшую пятницу будет проходить Единый налоговый платеж,
при этом в текущем месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят
окончательные расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе
уплачивают налог на дополнительный доход за четвертый квартал
почти на полтриллиона рублей, что еще может поддержать курс
российской валюты в ближайшие дни, однако продажи экспортной
выручки под расчеты с бюджетом достаточно дискретны и
малопредсказуемы.
    На внешнем контуре поддержкой рублю выступает рынок нефти,
где базовые сорта котируются вблизи трехнедельных максимумов.
Североморская смесь Brent <LCOc1> показывает сейчас минимальные
изменения у отметки $73 за баррель после роста накануне более
чем на один процент на фоне решения Дональда Трампа ввести
25-процентные пошлины при торговле с США для стран,
импортирующих нефть и газ из Венесуэлы. 
    На форексе индекс доллара оценивается в 104,31 <=USD>, что
близко от последних вчерашних котировок. Пара евро/доллар также
находится вблизи уровней вчерашнего закрытия и котируется по
$1,08 <EUR=>.
    Китайский юань теряет 0,1% на континентальном рынке КНР
(7,2610) <CNY=> и немного меньше - на офшорном (7,2670) <CNH=>.

2025/3/25 4:11,Yuan drops to two-week low despite PBOC's efforts as dollar firms,"SHANGHAI, March 25 (Reuters) - China's yuan fell to a
two-week low against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, as the central
bank's support efforts were overshadowed by the dollar's
strength and tariff concerns ahead of President Donald Trump's
looming deadline.
    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China set
the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed
to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1788 per dollar, 842 pips firmer
than a Reuters' estimate. This marked the largest gap in two
weeks, suggesting the central bank's attempts to tighten control
over the weakening currency.
    Still, the onshore yuan <CNY=CFXS> dropped to a low of
7.2650 per dollar, its weakest since March 10. 
    The offshore yuan <CNH=D3> fell for the sixth straight day,
reaching a low of 7.2703 per dollar, marking its longest losing
streak since October. 
    ""The currency has been bounced between positive and negative
trade headlines in the past 24 hours. It missed the risk rally
which followed reports of Trump's reciprocal tariffs to be more
targeted,"" said analysts at Citi in a note.
    Trump said on Monday that not all of his threatened levies
would be imposed on April 2 and some countries may get breaks.
    The dollar index <.DXY> hit a three-week high on Tuesday
after some strong U.S. services data and cautious optimism on
the tariff front.
    Spot yuan <CNY=CFXS> opened at 7.2620 and was last trading
at 7.2637 as of 0247 GMT, 32 pips lower than the previous late
session close and 1.18% weaker than the midpoint.
    ""USD longs building up as seen in USD/JPY's climb above 150
will also add upward pressure on the USD/CNH in near term. A
gauge of one-month call options over puts indicate bearish bets
on RMB (are) growing in the run up to the April 2 announcement,""
said Citi analysts. 
    Meanwhile, the PBOC said on Monday it will change the way it
sells its medium-term loans, a move that market participants say
may further erode the significance of the role of such a bond
instrument in guiding monetary policy. The central bank is
expected to inject 63 billion yuan ($8.68 billion) on a net
basis into the market on Tuesday. 
    China's sovereign bond yields were broadly down, with
10-year yields <CN240011=> dropping below 1.8%.
    The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value
versus six major currencies <=USD>, was 0.038% higher at 104.34.
    The offshore yuan traded at 7.2701 yuan per dollar, down
about 0.07% in Asian trade.

       路透上海3月25日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周二早盘低开百点下探半个月低点，随后跌幅略有收窄，中间价四连跌刷新逾两个月新低，较路透预测偏离扩至近850点。交易员表示，美元继续反弹，人民币也跟随小幅调整，不过4月初对等关税实施前，人民币大概率跟随美元窄幅波动。
    
    “短期美元/人民币就是跟着美元走，目前看美元还是有些反弹的空间，”一中资行交易员称，“中间价也有一点点动，人民币慢慢贬。”
    
    另一外资行交易员则认为，短期美元/人民币续跌空间比较有限，稳定的汇率对稳定金融市场更有意义。
    
    
    离岸CNH<CNH=D3>短暂跌破7.27关口，创近三周新低，目前离岸汇价略低于在岸，似乎离岸的贬值预期略有升温，不过目前看离岸人民币流动性并未收紧。
    
    花旗最新观点指出，美债收益率回升是人民币承压的关键，另外日圆走弱至150关口下方，也会拖累离岸CNH；另外期权角度看，在4月2日美国新一轮关税宣布前，市场对人民币看跌的押注持续增长。
    
    招商银行金融市场部认为，近期美元反弹有经济数据、欧洲利好兑现，关税临近等因素，在下周关税落地之前，还是需要警惕美元继续反弹。“但关税是不是再被豁免和延期也存在变数，这会限制反弹的幅度。”
    
    招行并指出，要让美元指数趋势彻底反转，还是需要美国经济下行的担忧被证伪，要么政策转向，要么经济一直维持高韧性，如果都没有，美元指数则仍可能重新回归下行趋势。
    
    美国总统特朗普最新表示，很可能在4月2日实施对等征税时排除一系列针对特定行业的关税，但特朗普政府的一位官员周一警告说，情况仍可能变化，尚未做出最终决定。华尔街认为，此举表明他在这个数周以来搅动市场的问题上表现出了灵活性。
    
    “投资者对白宫发布的每一条可能影响关税讨论的新闻保持谨慎，这是可以理解的，”BMO Capital Markets 在报告称，“从这一过程中得出的最重要结论之一是，唯一确定的主题就是不确定性。”
    
    今年大部分时间里，美元一直承受着压力，市场对特朗普将迅速出台有利于增长的政策的假设转变成了对贸易关税实施和最终影响的担忧。美国商品期货交易委员会(CFTC)上周五公布的数据显示，投机客上周对美元转为净看跌，为10月以来首次。
    
    
    全球汇市方面，美元兑日圆汇率周二早盘触及三周高点，在一些强劲的美国服务业数据和关税方面的谨慎乐观情绪之后，美元全线走坚。[FRX/CN]
    
    北京时间11:46，人民币兑美元<CNY=CFXS>即期报7.2613元，盘中最低触及7.265元，创3月10日以来新低，上日收报7.252元，夜盘终报7.2605元。今日人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>报7.1788元，创1月20日以来新低，上日为7.178元。截至目前人民币即期成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为181.65亿美元。

    虽然中国央行或缓和美元/人民币的上涨气势，但基本面对多头仍有利。中国央行意外提前预告3月中期借贷便利（MLF）操作规模，改变招标方式，标志着MLF与政策利率彻底脱钩，效果类似于结构性降息。在美国关税落地冲击前，央行释放呵护流动性信号，此前偏“鹰”政策态度有所缓和。[nL3S3Q70TB]
    
    而美国通胀风险则扩大了中美债券收益率差距，这将使美元兑人民币保持强劲。

 ((ewen.chew@thomsonreuters.com))"
2025/3/25 3:06,"BUZZ-COMMENT-USD/CNY gets green light, but PBOC may pull yellow flag","March 25 (Reuters) - 
    USD/CNY appears to be off to the races, with green lights on
the charts that will inspire more buyers, but China's central
bank is stubbornly defending the yuan, and could verbally or
directly intervene in FX markets to slow it down.
    The People's Bank of China set Tuesday's USD/CNY benchmark
only marginally higher, despite another jump in the USD index.
The PBOC used a stronger damping factor to squash the USD/CNY
fixing, affirming its stable-yuan pledge.
That could deter some bulls who might have crowded in following
Monday's breakout above the 100-day moving average, currently at
7.2573, and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the
September-January move at 7.2545. Those bullish cues point to
the 7.3000 psychological trading barrier, which the PBOC might
choose to defend.
While the central bank could slow the move higher, fundamentals
still underpin USD/CNY longs. Changes to the PBOC's medium-term
lending facility operation, while reducing its significance as a
monetary policy tool, might reaffirm an easing bias among
Chinese policymakers. The widening U.S.-China bond yield gap,
expanded by U.S. inflationary risks, should keep USD/CNY
buoyant.
Risks to USD/CNY longs might come from U.S.-China trade
negotiations, and the possibility of foreign capital inflows as
the mood improves for Chinese assets and the country's 2025
growth outlook.

    美国总统特朗普最新表示，很可能在4月2日实施对等征税时排除一系列针对特定行业的关税，但特朗普政府的一位官员周一警告说，情况仍可能变化，尚未做出最终决定。华尔街认为，此举表明他在这个数周以来搅动市场的问题上表现出了灵活性。
    
    “投资者对白宫发布的每一条可能影响关税讨论的新闻保持谨慎，这是可以理解的，”BMO Capital Markets 在报告称，“从这一过程中得出的最重要结论之一是，唯一确定的主题就是不确定性。”
    
    
    今年大部分时间里，美元一直承受着压力，市场对特朗普将迅速出台有利于增长的政策的假设转变成了对贸易关税实施和最终影响的担忧。美国商品期货交易委员会(CFTC) 上周五公布的数据显示，投机客上周对美元转为净看跌，为10月以来首次。
    
    全球汇市方面，美元指数<.DXY>周二亚洲早盘继续维持在104.30上方交投，特朗普的关税有些灵活的可能性，这缓和了市场谨慎情绪，但不确定性仍较大。[FRX/CN](完)

2025/3/25 0:23,路透测算的人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>今日料开在7.2630元附近,"路透上海3月25日 - 路透根据中国外汇交易中心(CFETS)公布的人民币汇率形成机制测算，人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周二预计会开在7.2630元附近，较上日贬值约850点。
    
    隔夜美国经济数据向好叠加特朗普可能对关税采取灵活态度，美元继续反弹，人民币的外部压力重新累积，国内监管层料加大对人民币单边贬值预期的过滤举措，助力稳定市场预期。

    上日人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>收报7.252元，而中间价则为7.178元。根据定价机制，今日中间价变动中，有740点下跌反映市场供求影响，另有110点下跌反映的是隔夜一篮子汇率基本保持不变所需要的点数；“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。

    路透测算的上日人民币兑美元中间价为7.2496元，和外汇交易中心公布的实际值偏差716点。上日路透根据CFETS公布的中间价测算，人民币汇率CFETS指数、参考SDR（特别提款权）篮子指数和参考BIS(国际清算银行)篮子指数分别为98.88、92.94和105.12。

    上日(截至北京时间次日凌晨3点)人民币兑美元即期累计成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为421.32亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

2025/3/24 23:25,"BUZZ-Asia Day Ahead-Response to higher Wall Street, weak yen leads","March 25 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's auto tariffs are
coming, but not all levies will be imposed on April 2, which was well received
by investors on Monday. U.S. business activity climbed in March, but sentiment
deteriorated. 
    Wall Street and Treasury yields rose, the U.S. dollar edged higher, led by
yen weakness, and commodities closed mixed. 
    A positive lead for Asian markets, with EM ETFs up 0.44%. There is a light
second-tier regional data schedule, while the Bank of Japan will release the
minutes of its January 23-24 policy meeting. The focus will be on the regional
response to Wall Street's bounce and yen weakness.
    Dow +1.42%, S&P +1.76%, and Nasdaq +2.27% led by bargain-hunting in Nvidia
and Tesla amid signs the Trump administration might take a more measured
approach on tariffs.
    Treasury yields climbed, 2yr +9bp to 4.039%, 10yr +8bp to 4.337%, and 30yr
+7bp to 4.666%, as markets priced expectations of lower U.S. tariffs. 
    Oil rose as Trump plans a 25% tariff on countries that buy Venezuelan oil or
gas, Brent and WTI +1.25%. U.S. copper -0.55% and gold -0.4%, capped by the
firmer USD, and Trump hints at some flexibility regarding tariffs. 
    The U.S. dollar <=USD> firmed 0.25%, led by USD/JPY +0.9% driven by higher
UST yields. EUR -0.1%, GBP +0.05%, USD/CNH +0.05%, AUD +0.2%, NZD -0.05%, and
USD/CAD -0.3%.

2025/3/24 15:02,BUZZ-FX options wrap - Month-end USD boost is unpursued,"Renewed demand for the USD is being fuelled by month and quarter-end FX
rebalancing flows, according to bank models, especially versus the EUR. However,
while the options market recognises the short term risk for USD gains, traders
aren't aggressively renewing long USD call positions. 
    EUR/USD options epitomise the situation, with light demand and increased
premiums for shorter-dated expiry downside strike options, while longer-term
expiry options maintain a bias toward further gains toward 1.1500. 
    G10 FX option implied volatility remains generally subdued following
declines from the early-to-mid March highs. This trend is typical in an
environment where FX spot markets are consolidating, and risk appetite is not
significantly weak.
    That's been the case in USD/JPY as the spot market recovered from March 11
lows since October at 146.55, pressuring benchmark 1-month implied volatility
back to the lower 9s and the downside over upside strike on 1-month 25 delta
risk reversals to 1.3 from 1.85. Demand from the lower levels remains limited
and there hasn't been any stand-out demand or supply for strikes in either
direction. 
    However, tariff uncertainties persist and there are more economic data
releases looming, which should help to limit deeper G10 FX implied volatility
setbacks.
    There are many large strikes expiring this week and related hedging flows
may have more influence in quieter FX markets.

2025/3/24 14:35,"ОБОБЩЕНИЕ-Рубль слабеет на МОЕХ при низкой активности экспорта, но дорожает на FX","(-)
       МОСКВА, 24 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль котируется на Мосбирже в
минусе под занавес торгов понедельника, и против него сыграли
невысокий сегодня объем продаж экспортной валютной выручки и
перманентный спрос импортеров на инвалюту, чей рублевый курс на
внутреннем рынке остается вблизи многомесячных минимумов.
    На внешних же рынках рубль котируется в плюсе - там в
котировках российской валюты могут более ярко проявляться
ожидания улучшения геополитической ситуации, тогда как в
российском поле сейчас больший вес имеют реальные денежные
потоки.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 17.15 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,54, российская валюта теряет
0,7%, утром дорожая до 11,37.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к этому времени
котировались вблизи отметок 11,56, 86,00 и 93,60 соответственно,
и рубль теряет 0,6% к юаню, 0,3% к доллару и показывает нулевую
динамику против евро.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 17.15 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 84,15, и рубль набирает 0,4%, утром дорожая до 83,50.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> находится сейчас на форексе вблизи
отметки 90,88, и здесь рубль набирает 0,6%.
    ""Импорт по низам выкупать стал валюту, а экспорт сегодня не
продает ее в тех объемах, что от него ждут на этой неделе"", -
высказался по текущей биржевой динамике рубля дилер крупного
российского банка, отметив, что изменения - ""в пределах нормы""
при нынешней волатильности рынка.
    В ближайшую пятницу будет проходить Единый налоговый платеж,
при этом в текущем месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят
окончательные расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе
уплачивают налог на дополнительный доход за четвертый квартал
почти на полтриллиона рублей, что может поддержать курс
российской валюты, однако продажи экспортной выручки под расчеты
с бюджетом достаточно дискретны и малопредсказуемы.
    Внутренней поддержкой рублю сейчас является сохраненная
Центробанком высокая ключевая ставка в 21% годовых, охлаждающая
внутренний потребительский спрос, что в том числе приводит и к
сокращению импортного спроса на иностранную валюту. В последние
же дни импортеры могли купиться на привлекательно низкий
валютный курс, во многом сформировавшийся за счет улучшения
геополитической ситуации, и объемы их спроса на инвалюту стали
перебивать текущее предложение экспортной выручки.
    Участники валютного рынка также продолжают следить за
внешнеполитической новостной повесткой. Сегодня в фокусе
внимания - очередные переговоры США и России в Саудовской
Аравии.
    Надежды на скорое завершение украинского конфликта, а также
ожидания улучшения отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом с
последующей возможностью ослабления американских рестрикций
против России выступали основной поддержкой рублю в последнее
время.
    ""Вряд ли после них (переговоров) прозвучат прорывные
заявления, но к такому сценарию стоит быть готовыми"", - сказал
Алексей Антонов из компании Алор Брокер.
    ""Пока сохраняется возможность для урегулирования
внешнеполитической повестки, рубль, вероятно, продолжит
консолидироваться около уровня 85 рублей за доллар"", - считает
Владимир Евстифеев из банка Зенит.
    Также на стороне российской валюты играют интервенции ЦБР,
который сейчас продает китайские юани почти на 6 миллиардов
рублей в день.
    ""На текущей неделе мы допускаем формирование новой волны

2025/3/24 11:48,"Рубль на Мосбирже сменил знак на минус, но остается в плюсе на форексе","МОСКВА, 24 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль ушел в минус на
Мосбирже, и участники рынка винят в этом экспортеров, не
оправдавших сегодня рыночных ожиданий роста продаж валютной
выручки под налоговые выплаты, при этом импортеры по-прежнему
заметны в покупках инвалюты по более-менее выгодным текущим
курсам, остающимся вблизи многомесячных экстремумов.
    На внешних же рынках рубль продолжает котироваться в плюсе,
хотя и с частичной утратой утреннего преимущества - там в
котировках российской валюты могут более ярко проявляться
ожидания улучшения геополитической ситуации, тогда как в
российском ""поле"" сейчас больший вес имеют реальные денежные
потоки.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 14.30 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,56, российская валюта теряет
0,9%, утром дорожая до 11,37.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к этому времени
котировались вблизи отметок 11,57, 86,30 и 93,30 соответственно,
и рубль теряет по 0,7% против всех трех ключевых валют.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 14.30 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 84,12, и рубль набирает 0,4%, утром дорожая до 83,50.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> находится сейчас на форексе вблизи
отметки 91,23, и здесь рубль набирает 0,2%.
    ""Импорт по низам выкупать стал валюту, а экспорт сегодня не
продает ее в тех объемах, что от него ждут на этой неделе"", -
высказался по текущей биржевой динамике рубля дилер крупного
российского банка, отметив, что изменения - ""в пределах нормы""
при нынешней волатильности рынка.
    В ближайшую пятницу будет проходить Единый налоговый платеж,
при этом в текущем месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят
окончательные расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе
уплачивают налог на дополнительный доход за четвертый квартал
почти на полтриллиона рублей, что может поддержать курс
российской валюты, однако продажи экспортной выручки под расчеты
с бюджетом достаточно дискретны и малопредсказуемы.
    Внутренней поддержкой рублю сейчас является сохраненная
Центробанком высокая ключевая ставка в 21% годовых, охлаждающая
внутренний потребительский спрос, что в том числе приводит к
сокращению покупок инвалюты импортерами. В последние дни они
могли купиться на привлекательно низкий валютный курс, во многом
сформировавшийся за счет улучшения геополитической ситуации, и
объемы их спроса на инвалюту стали перебивать текущее
предложение экспортной выручки.
    Участники валютного рынка также продолжают следить за
внешнеполитической новостной повесткой. Сегодня в фокусе
внимания - очередные переговоры США и России в Саудовской
Аравии.
    ""Вряд ли после них (переговоров) прозвучат прорывные
заявления, но к такому сценарию стоит быть готовыми"", - сказал
Алексей Антонов из компании Алор Брокер.
    ""Пока сохраняется возможность для урегулирования
внешнеполитической повестки, рубль, вероятно, продолжит
консолидироваться около уровня 85 рублей за доллар"", - считает
Владимир Евстифеев из банка Зенит.
    ""На текущей неделе мы допускаем формирование новой волны
укрепления рубля"", - сказал Денис Попов из банка ПСБ.
    Он не исключает ко вторнику новой порции геополитического
позитива, а также полагает, что экспортеры безусловно нарастят
продажи валюты, готовясь к уплате крупных налогов.

       路透上海/北京3月24日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周一收创两周新低；中间
价亦三连跌创逾两个月低点，较路透预测偏离扩至逾700点。交易员表示，日内美元指数<.D
XY>再度回落至104下方，但在美国对等关税实施前市场情绪偏谨慎，人民币料继续承压。
    
    市场人士也指出，美国数据显示经济有所疲软，但应该还没到衰退的水平，加上欧洲也
缺乏进一步的利好，短期美元企稳后有可能积累反弹动能；关税继续上升的可能性也会加剧
人民币的调整压力，短期继续呈现易跌难升走势。
    
    “美元基本上企稳了，而且下周还有对等关税要公布，人民币有压力的，”一外资行交
易员称。
    
    另一外资行交易员表示，本身人民币缺乏升值的驱动因素，不过从中间价看，人民币可
以调整的空间也不大，“中间价都扛了这么久，就算靴子落地也不大会放开。”
    
    瑞穗银行亚洲首席策略师张建泰点评称，在美国即将宣布对等关税的情况下，中国央行
不太可能退出对中间价的支持；尽管中美贸易代表预计本周将举行会谈，但中美迅速达成贸
易协议的可能性很小。
    
    
    招商银行金融市场部观点认为，需重点关注特朗普相关言论，警惕关税冲击对非美货币
带来冲击，造成美元的阶段性反弹。中国央行稳定汇率态度依然坚决情况下，预计人民币仍
维持震荡格局，重点关注中美谈判以及双方的财政货币增量政策。
    
    兴业研究则指出，随着4月2日对等关税潜在实施时点临近，叠加欧洲增长叙事暂时利多
出尽，欧元多头热情显著降温；4月2日之前可以保持观望态度，若关税的不确定性扫除，或
未有超预期负面关税消息释出，人民币所受基本面利多影响可能占上风。
    
    此前美国总统特朗普表示，他的首席贸易代表计划本周与中国同行通话。特朗普重申，
他计划利用贸易关税来帮助缩小美国与其主要经济竞争对手之间的贸易逆差，但表示关税方
面会有灵活性。他计划于4月2日对全球各国实行对等关税。
    
    高盛最新报告下调了美国的经济增长预期，他们并预计美国关税将大幅上升，这应该对
美元有利。

2025/3/24 8:31,Рубль дорожает на старте налоговой недели,"МОСКВА, 24 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль подрастает на торгах
понедельника, и на его стороне сейчас играет фактор предстоящих
в пятницу налоговых выплат, обычно подразумевающих краткосрочное
повышение продаж экспортной выручки под расчеты с бюджетом.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 11.25 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,39, российская валюта
набирает две трети процента.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 11.10 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 83,60, и рубль набирает 1,1%.
    Пара доллар/рубль на внебиржевом российском валютном рынке к
этому времени котировалась в диапазоне 83,00-83,80, согласно
усредненным данным российских поставщиков финансовых услуг.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> находится сейчас на форексе вблизи
отметки 90,75, и здесь рубль набирает 0,7%. На российском же
межбанке евро сейчас котируется в диапазоне 89,70-91,20 рубль.
    Единый налоговый платеж проводится 28 марта, при этом в
текущем месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят окончательные
расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе уплачивают налог
на дополнительный доход за четвертый квартал почти на
полтриллиона рублей, что может поддержать курс российской
валюты.
    Участники валютного рынка также продолжают следить за
внешнеполитической новостной повесткой. Сегодня в фокусе
внимания - уже должны были начавшиеся в Саудовской Аравии
очередные переговоры США и России.
    ""Сегодня ожидаются переговоры делегаций России и США по
Украине. Вряд ли после них прозвучат прорывные заявления, но к
такому сценарию стоит быть готовыми"", - сказал Алексей Антонов
из компании Алор Брокер.
    Надежды на скорое завершение украинского конфликта, а также
ожидания улучшения отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом с
последующей возможностью ослабления американских рестрикций
против России выступали основной поддержкой рублю в последнее
время.
    Внутренней поддержкой рублю сейчас является сохраненная
Центробанком высокая ключевая ставка в 21% годовых, охлаждающая
внутренний потребительский спрос, что в том числе приводит к
сокращению покупок инвалюты импортерами.
    Также на стороне российской валюты играют интервенции ЦБР,
который сейчас продает китайские юани почти на 6 миллиардов
рублей в день.
    ""На текущей неделе мы допускаем формирование новой волны
укрепления рубля"", - сказал Денис Попов из банка ПСБ.
    Он не исключает ко вторнику новой порции геополитического
позитива, а также не полагает, что экспортеры безусловно
нарастят продажи валюты, готовясь к уплате крупных налогов.
    С учетом этого Попов ждет к концу недели смещения стоимости
иностранной валюты к локальным минимумам, к диапазонам
11,00-11,3 рубля за юань и 80-82 за доллар.

2025/3/24 8:02,Юань достиг минимума 2нед на фоне приближения ответных пошлин Трампа,"ШАНХАЙ, 24 мар (Рейтер) - Юань достиг в понедельник
минимума двух недель по отношению к доллару - опасения
инвесторов о торговых разногласиях между двумя крупнейшими
мировыми экономиками усилились с приближением срока вступления в
силу ответных пошлин президента США Дональда Трампа.
    Спотовый юань в Китайской системе валютной торговли SFETS на
материковом рынке <CNY=CFXS> к 10:24 МСК был малоподвижен у
отметки 7,2537?, ранее в ходе сессии опустившись до минимума
двух недель в 7,2615. На офшорном рынке валюта <CNH=> была
стабильна на уровне 7,2565. 
    По словам ряда наблюдателей рынка, план председателя КНР Си
Цзиньпина сделать юань основой финансовой стратегии Китая помог
ограничить спад китайской валюты, в то время как 20-процентные
пошлины администрации Трампа ограничили ее подъем.
    Трамп по-прежнему планирует вступление в силу новых ответных
пошлин со 2 апреля, сообщил Белый дом на прошлой неделе.
    Однако в отличие от волатильного ""зеленого"", юань в основном
был стабилен, торгуясь в узком диапазоне примерно в 1% с начала
марта.
    ""Пекин не желает ни сильного, ни слабого юаня"", - сказал
Марк Чендлер из Bannockburn Global Forex.
    ""Он хочет широкой стабильности юаня по отношению к доллару.
Один ряд причин, по которым Народный банк Китая отказался от
снижения ставок, возможно, связан с обменным курсом"".
    Перед открытием сессии ЦБ Китая объявил срединный
фиксированный курс <CNY=PBOC> на уровне 7,1780 за доллар - самом
слабом с 20 января. Значение оказалось на 716 pips
(десятитысячных долей процентного пункта) сильнее приведенного
Рейтер прогноза аналитиков <CNY=RTRS> в 7,2496.

2025/3/24 6:44,"Рубль будет отслеживать новостной фон, реагировать на предналоговые потоки","МОСКВА, 24 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль в понедельник будет
ждать новости из Саудовской Аравии, где на сегодня запланированы
очередные переговоры США и РФ, поскольку геополитическая
повестка остается важным фактором влияния на котировки
российской валюты.
    На внешнем контуре косвенно в пользу рубля сейчас выступает
рынок нефти, где базовые сорта котируются вблизи трехнедельных
максимумов.
    Локально же могут благотворно влиять увеличенные продажи
экспортной валютной выручки под уплату в ближайшую пятницу
корпоративных налогов.
    Внутренней поддержкой рубля выступает и сохраненная
Центробанком высокая ключевая ставка, охлаждающая внутренний
потребительский спрос, что в том числе приводит к сокращению
покупок инвалюты импортерами.
    Также на стороне российской валюты играют интервенции
Центробанка, который сейчас продает китайские юани почти на 6
миллиардов рублей в день.
    Пятничные торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра""
завершились на уровне 12,47 рубля за юань - российская валюта
подорожала на треть процента при объеме сделок в 100 миллиардов
рублей. По итогам недели рубль вырос к юаню почти на три
процента.
    В паре с долларом рубль на форексе подорожал в пятницу на
полпроцента <RUB=>, набрав за неделю 1,2%.
    В паре с евро рубль по итогам пятницы укрепился на 0,8%,
завершив торги на форексе котировкой 91,39, а по итогам недели
российская валюта подорожала против европейской на 1,8%.
    Прошлая неделя оказалась весьма волатильной для российской
валюты. В частности, рубль во вторник взлетел на максимумы с
прошлого июня, отметки 81,00 за доллар и 88,88 за евро на
форексе, а также 11,13 за юань на Мосбирже, но уже в среду
показал сильнейшее сессионное падение к ключевым валютам в
текущем году, на 2,5-2,8%. 
    В обоих случаях на котировки влияла преимущественно динамика
спекулятивных потоков, вначале в ожидании телефонных переговоров
президентов США и РФ, и затем по их факту. Свою роль в скачке
волатильности на прошлой неделе играл и фактор прошедшей в
четверг квартальной экспирации валютных фьючерсов на Мосбирже.
    Основной поддержкой рублю по-прежнему выступают надежды на
скорое завершение украинского конфликта, а также ожидания
улучшения отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом с последующей
возможностью ослабления американских рестрикций против России.
    Сегодняшние переговоры между США и РФ должна начаться в
Эр-Рияде в 10.00 МСК, при этом американские переговорщики будут
нацеплены на то, чтобы приблизить соглашение о прекращении огня
в Черном море и более широкое перемирие между Россией и
Украиной.
    В ближайшие дни в пользу рубля будет выступать возможная
активация продаж валютной выручки экспортерами под уплату
налогов 28 марта, при этом в текущем месяце сырьевые корпорации
проводят окончательные расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том
числе уплачивают налог на дополнительный доход за четвертый
квартал почти на полтриллиона рублей.
    Североморская нефтяная смесь Brent <LCOc1> в начале марта
падала на отметку $68,33 впервые с начала декабря 2021 года, но
с тех пор она восстановила часть потерь, сейчас котируется по
$72 за баррель, что близко от трехнедельного максимума $72,51,
достигнутого в пятницу после ужесточения санкций США в отношении
иранской нефти. 
    На форексе индекс доллара снижается на 0,1% и оценивается в
103,99 <=USD>, пара евро/доллар подрастает на 0,2% и котируется
по $1,0837 <EUR=>.

2025/3/24 3:27,中国汇市：美指重返104人民币早盘触两周低点，关税战前市场情绪偏谨慎,"* 
      人民币早盘短暂触及两周低点
    

        * 
      中间价实际值和路透预测偏离超700点
    

        * 
      新一轮关税战前市场情绪趋于谨慎
    

        * 
      短期人民币跟随美元窄幅波动
    

  

       路透上海3月24日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周一早盘低开低走，盘中汇价跌破7.26关口，触两周低点，中间价三连跌创逾两个月新低，较路透预测偏离扩至逾700点。交易员表示，欧元多头获利了结美元顺势反弹，另外美国对等关税实施前市场情绪偏谨慎，这也部分加剧人民币的贬压。
    
    市场人士也指出，美国数据显示经济有所疲软，但应该还没到衰退的水平，加上欧洲也缺乏进一步的利好，在全球关税战欧元前进一步上行空间受限；关税继续上升的可能性也会加剧人民币的调整压力，短期继续呈现易跌难升走势。
    
    “本身人民币缺乏升值的驱动因素，不过从中间价看，人民币可以调整的空间也不大，”一外资行交易员称，“中间价都扛了这么久，就算靴子落地也不大会放开。”
    
    
    招商银行金融市场部最新观点称，需重点关注特朗普相关言论，警惕关税冲击对非美货币带来冲击，造成美元的阶段性反弹。中国央行稳定汇率态度依然坚决情况下，预计人民币仍维持震荡格局，重点关注中美谈判以及双方的财政货币增量政策。
    
    兴业研究则指出，随着4月2日对等关税潜在实施时点临近，叠加欧洲增长叙事暂时利多出尽，欧元多头热情显著降温；4月2日之前可以保持观望态度，若关税的不确定性扫除，或未有超预期负面关税消息释出，人民币所受基本面利多影响可能占上风。
    
    此前美国总统特朗普表示，他的首席贸易代表计划本周与中国同行通话。特朗普重申，他计划利用贸易关税来帮助缩小美国与其主要经济竞争对手之间的贸易逆差，但表示关税方面会有灵活性。他计划于4月2日对全球各国实行对等关税。
    
    高盛最新报告下调了美国的经济增长预期，他们并预计美国关税将大幅上升，这应该对美元有利。
    
    
    全球汇市方面，美元兑主要货币周一略低于三周高点，交易员们正谨慎等待特朗普下一轮关税政策的明确信息。[FRX/CN]
    
    北京时间11:08，人民币兑美元<CNY=CFXS>即期报7.2594元，上日收报7.2489元，夜盘终报7.2506元。今日人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>报7.178元，创1月20日以来新低，上日为7.176元。截至目前人民币即期成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为141.1亿美元。

    海外无本金交割远期外汇(NDF)<CNYNDFOR=>市场上，美元/人民币一年期品种<CNY1YNDFOR=>最新报在7.0805元, 上日尾盘为7.075元。香港的离岸人民币兑美元即期<CNH=D3>最新报在7.2627元, 当前汇价与在岸即期价差为33点，上一交易日尾盘报7.2577元。（完）

2025/3/24 1:27,中国汇市：人民币兑美元中间价刷新逾两个月新低，美元指数重返104关口上方,"路透上海3月24日 - 人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周一报7.1780元，较上日的7.176元小跌20点，创1月20日以来新低，和路透预测偏离扩至逾700点；美元<.DXY>重返104关口，人民币的外部压力有所上升，监管层则继续延续有保有放思路，适度放松中间价的同时，继续过滤多数单边预期。

    人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>上日收盘报7.2489元，夜盘终报7.2506元。离岸人民币即期<CNH=D3>最新报7.2535元，上日收盘在7.2577元。稍早前路透测算今日人民币中间价大概会开在7.2496元附近，较上日贬值约736点，“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。
    

    中金外汇团队最新观点认为，临近4月，特朗普释放的关税信号可能对人民币汇率预期产生影响。若关税预期带动美元反弹，或特朗普释放对中国加征关税的信号，人民币汇率可能有一定贬值压力。
    
    兴业研究指出，随着4月2日对等关税潜在实施时点临近，叠加欧洲增长叙事暂时利多出尽，欧元多头热情显著降温；4月2日之前可以保持观望态度，若关税的不确定性扫除，或未有超预期负面关税消息释出，人民币所受基本面利多影响可能占上风。
    
    此前美国总统特朗普表示，他的首席贸易代表计划本周与中国同行通话。特朗普重申，他计划利用贸易关税来帮助缩小美国与其主要经济竞争对手之间的贸易逆差，但表示关税方面会有灵活性。他计划于4月2日对全球各国实行对等关税。

    为便于市场成员和社会公众获取CFETS人民币汇率指数系列数据，自2016年2月22日起，CFETS在中国货币网新增人民币汇率指数展示功能，并按周和按月发布人民币汇率指数数据。

    2016年底CFETS进行首次货币篮子规则调整，CFETS篮子货币数量由13种调升为24种，同时调整了相关货币权重；SDR篮子也调整了货币权重，并与CFETS货币篮子均重新定基，重新定基日为2016年最后一个交易日。

    2019年底开始交易中心每年年末都对CFETS指数进行权重微调和重新定基，此举旨在进一步增强指数的代表性。2024年底交易中心将CFETS指数货币篮子和权重都进行调整，篮子货币总数增至25个。[nL4S3NW0I5]

    2022年底外汇交易中心对SDR指数货币权重进行微调。2019年底对BIS指数货币权重进行微调；2023年底对BIS指数货币篮子和权重都进行了调整，BIS篮子货币数量调整为43种。（完）

2025/3/24 0:23,路透测算的人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>今日料开在7.2496元附近,"路透上海3月24日 - 路透根据中国外汇交易中心(CFETS)公布的人民币汇率形成机制测算，人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周一预计会开在7.2496元附近，较上日贬值约736点。

    上周五欧元多头获利了结，美元顺势展开反弹，随着4月初美国新一轮关税措施临近，市场谨慎情绪有所蔓延，美元跌势放缓，这对人民币而言贬值压力仍不小，监管层料延续对中间价单边预期的过滤，避免在关键时期扰动市场情绪。
    
    上日人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>收报7.2489元，而中间价则为7.176元。根据定价机制，今日中间价变动中，有729点下跌反映市场供求影响，另有7点下跌反映的是隔夜一篮子汇率基本保持不变所需要的点数；“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。

    路透测算的上日人民币兑美元中间价为7.2423元，和外汇交易中心公布的实际值偏差663点。上日路透根据CFETS公布的中间价测算，人民币汇率CFETS指数、参考SDR（特别提款权）篮子指数和参考BIS(国际清算银行)篮子指数分别为98.78、92.8和105。

    上日(截至北京时间次日凌晨3点)人民币兑美元即期累计成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为437.69亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

2025/3/24 0:02,《汇市短评》一周前瞻：对关税政策谨慎乐观，重点关注俄乌和谈,"路透3月24日 - 市场在谨慎乐观中结束上周交投，交易员们仔细研究美国总统特朗普关于关税的略微和解的言论以及美联储官员对经济的谨慎乐观评估。
    
    特朗普表示，他计划与中国国家主席习近平通话，美国贸易代表将在本周与中国对等官员通话。美联储官员表示，经济强劲，但由于经济不确定性，他们支持采取谨慎的政策。
    
    美国股市勉强收涨，美国公债收益率涨跌互现，美元反弹，油价攀升，黄金下跌。

    周末新闻方面，彭博报道称，美国希望在4月20日之前达成俄罗斯与乌克兰的停火协议，特朗普表示阻止俄乌战争进一步升级的努力“在掌控之中”。加拿大宣布提前举行大选，土耳其法院以贪腐罪名将伊斯坦布尔市长送监候审。[nL6S3Q603O][nL6S3Q6042][nL6S3Q603T]
    
    俄乌停火的希望可能会支撑亚洲的风险情绪，但中国国务院总理李强警告“不稳定不确定性上升”，可能会抑制乐观情绪。本周亚洲将公布许多经济数据，包括3月采购经理人指数（PMI）。[nL3S3Q6019]
    
    受关税乐观情绪影响，道琼斯指数周五收涨0.08%，标普500指数上涨0.08%，纳斯达克指数上涨0.52%。美国长期公债收益率小幅上涨；两年期收益率持平于3.9540%，10年期收益率上涨1.7个基点至4.25%，30年期收益率上涨2.5个基点至4.5920%。

    油价因供应紧张而上涨，布兰特原油上涨0.2%，WTI原油上涨0.3%。美国铜价从早盘的跌幅中反弹，最终持平。黄金下跌1%，因美元走强。

    由于美联储官员重申对利率保持耐心，美元 <=USD> 走强0.35%。欧元下跌0.4%，英镑下跌0.35%，日圆下跌0.35%，瑞郎下跌0.2%，澳元下跌0.5%，新西兰元下跌0.45%，加元下跌0.25%，离岸人民币持平。

2025/3/23 23:30,"BUZZ-Asia Day Ahead-Cautious optimism on tariffs, Ukraine leads","March 24 (Reuters) - Markets ended the week on a cautiously optimistic
note on Friday as traders sifted through President Donald Trump's slightly
conciliatory note on tariffs and Federal Reserve officials' guardedly upbeat
assessment of the economy.
    Trump said he planned to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping and that
the U.S. trade chief would speak with his Chinese counterpart this week. Fed
officials said the economy was strong but backed a cautious policy approach due
to economic uncertainty. 
    Wall Street eked out gains, Treasury yields ended mixed, the U.S. dollar
rallied, oil climbed, and gold retreated.
    In weekend news, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. hopes to reach a
Russia-Ukraine truce agreement by April 20, Trump said efforts to temper the
conflict were 'somewhat under control', Canada called a snap election and a
Turkish court jailed Istanbul's mayor before a trial.
    Ukraine ceasefire hopes may support risk sentiment in Asia though optimism
is likely to be tempered by Chinese Premier Li Qiang's warning of ""rising
instability and uncertainty."" March PMIs for many Asian centres lead a fairly
busy data schedule.
    Dow +0.08%, S&P +0.08%, and Nasdaq +0.52% on tariff optimism. Long-term
yields inched higher; 2yr unchanged at 3.9540%, 10yr +1.7bps to 4.25% and 30yr

    Oil firmed on tight supply, Brent +0.2% and WTI +0.3%. U.S. copper recovered
from an early loss to end unchanged. Gold fell 1% on the higher dollar.
    The U.S. dollar <=USD> firmed 0.35% as Fed officials reiterated patience on
rates. EUR -0.4% as profit-taking continued, GBP -0.35%, JPY -0.35%, CHF -0.2%,

2025/3/22 17:06,Week Ahead: Is The Dollar Bottoming?,"Week Ahead: Is The Dollar Bottoming?Mar 22, 2025

Image Source:?Pixabay

After falling steadily since from the end of Q3 24 through the first part of January, the dollar stabilized last week, despite the dovish market takeaway from the Federal Reserve. The median projection for growth was shaved while the inflation project was raised. Still, despite the Atlanta Fed's GDP Now tracking a contraction here in Q1, few are that pessimistic. None of the 58 economists in Bloomberg's survey see a contraction, and only one estimate has growth below 2%. While many are talking about ""stagflation,"" it seems exaggerated. The median Fed projection sees growth slowing but only toward trend (1.8%), which is the estimate of the pace of non-inflationary growth. The tariffs are seen as a potential one-off (transitory) impact on prices. Even though inflation proving sticky, the Fed's median dot projection of the PCE deflator of 2.7% this year (up from 2.5% in 2024) and 2.2% is not the kind of price pressures associated with stagflation. The median forecast in Bloomberg's survey is lower than the Fed's seeing the deflator at 2.4% this year and 2.3% next year,?

Prices will be very much on investors' minds next week. The US reports the February PCE deflator, which is not so much new news given the ability of economists to forecast it fairly accurately after having the CPI and PPI in hand. The UK and Australia report February CPI. Tokyo reports March CPI which gives strong insight into national developments. Mexico reports inflation for the first half of March, but the highlight of the week will be the central bank's meeting on Thursday, and a 50 bp rate cut looks likely. There is bound to be last minute jockeying ahead of the April 2 US tariff announcement. Canada's Prime Minister Carney is expected to call for snap election on Sunday that could be set for either late April or early May.?

US

Drivers: ?US reciprocal tariffs and sectoral tariffs are threatened for April 2. Tariffs are understood to boost prices and weaken demand. Not only did the Chair Powell seem to play down the latter, but so are businesses and investors. Growth forecasts are being reduced. While surveys show elevated inflation expectations, market-based measures, such as the two- and10-year break-evens (the difference between the conventional yield and the yield of the inflation-protected security) are lower than where they finished last month and the 2-10-year yield curve is well with last month's range. After rallying from late last September through mid-January, the dollar has been trending broadly lower. Momentum indicators are getting stretched and the greenback's downside momentum has stalled.?

Data: ?February personal consumption data, durable goods orders (and shipments) and March survey data (several regional Fed reports, Conference Board, and the preliminary PMI) are due and they will help Q1 GDP forecasts. The Atlanta Fed's GDP tracker is still looking at a contraction, but it has been pared to -1.8%, but the lowest forecast in Bloomberg's survey (with 58 respondents) is for a 1.2% expansion. The CPI and PPI take most of the guesswork away from forecasting the PCE deflator, which the Fed targets. The headline will be little changed at 2.5%, while the core rate ticks up to 2.7% from 2.6%.

Prices: ?The Dollar Index has been confined to roughly a 103.20-104.15 range since March 7. It frayed the upper end of the range ahead of the weekend and settled above 104.00 for the first time since March 6. A key question is whether this sideways movement is the formation of a bottom or a nesting phase before the next leg down. With momentum indicators stretched, month- and quarter-end approaching, and the April 2 tariff announcements looming, we are more inclined to see it as a near-term bottoming pattern after about a 6.25% drop since January 13, a week before the inauguration. There may be near-term potential toward 104.90-105.00.

EMU

Drivers: ?The prospects for a cease fire in Russia's war on Ukraine and the political deal in Germany on military and infrastructure support have reduced near-term downside risks in the eurozone. These developments look to have been discounted. After rising by nearly 50 bp in the first two weeks of March, the 10-year German Bund yield slipped 12 bp last week, its largest weekly declines this year. The US two-year premium over Germany ended 2024 near 220 bp and at the end of February was about 180 bp. It bottomed earlier this month near 138 bp and rose for the second consecutive week and approached 150 bp.?

Data: The flash March PMI is the data highlight. Recall that the composite rose to 50.2 in January and stayed there in February, its highest level since last August. It was at 49.6 in December and 50.3 in March 2024. The ECB reports the results of its inflation survey. In February, the median forecast was at 2.6% and 2.4% for the one- and three-year outlooks.

Prices: ?The euro made a marginal new high for the year last week near $1.0955, but the upside momentum stalled. It fell through $1.08 ahead of the weekend for the first time in a couple of weeks. With the momentum indicators turning lower and the firming of the US two-year premium over German, the risks seem to favor the euro's downside into month-end and ahead of the April 2 US tariff announcement. We suspect there is potential toward the $1.0700-25 area, where several technical levels converge.?

PRC

Drivers: ?Beijing wants neither a strong nor weak yuan. It wants a broadly stable one against the US dollar. One set of reasons why the PBOC has been reluctant to cut rates may be related to the exchange rate. Many international investors are under-weight Chinese stocks. The outperformance is giving international fund managers a new challenge. US efforts to curb Chinese technological advances seems to have largely failed. It is not only DeepSeek, but several other technological breakthroughs, including BDY's rapid EV charge, which reportedly is nearly as fast as refueling ICE. Two flashpoints are emerging. The first is whether Beijing formally blocks CK Hutchinson sales of ports to Blackrock, among which include the ports on both sides of the Panama Canal. The second is if Beijing prevents BYD from building a plant in Mexico for fear of losing its proprietary technology to the US.?

Data:? ?It is a light week for Chinese data and the main event is the setting of the one-year Medium-Term Lending Facility rate. It is expected to remain unchanged at 2.0%, but the lending amount may increase from CNY300 bln last month.?

Prices: The dollar rose for the first time in three weeks against the offshore yuan, which is consistent with its broadly firmer tone. It finished the week above the 20-day moving average (~CNH7.2530) and traded above CNH7.26 ahead of the weekend. The next hurdle is seen near CNH7.2700-25. The month's high is closer to CNH7.3075 and could be challenged if the greenback extends its recovery against the other major currencies, which, from a technical vantage point, looks like a reasonable scenario.?

Japan

Drivers:? ?The exchange rate often seems most sensitive to changing US and Japanese interest rates. The US 10-year premium over Japan peaked a few days after dollar did against the yen in early January near 360 bp. It is now near 270 bp after setting a two-and-a-half year low earlier this month a little below 265 bp. However, the correlation has weakened recently.?

Data: ?There are two highlights. The first is the preliminary March PMI that will begin the week. The market tends not to be particularly sensitive to the PMI, though the composite has risen for four consecutive months through February at 52.0, matched its best level since last August. The market is more sensitive to the other highlight, Tokyo's March CPI at the end of the week. While fresh food prices may have peaked, they still may be filtering through to processed foods and the costs of dining out. Still price pressures look little changed in March from February.?

Prices: The dollar rose against the yen in five of the past six sessions, but the 10-year US Treasury yield slipped every day last week. The US 10-year premium over Japan also narrowed in each session last week. The dollar pushed above JPY150 in the middle of last week but has not settled above it so far this month. Still, the momentum indicators are constructive and after falling by around 7.75% from January 10 through March 11, consolidative/corrective forces appear to have moved into ascendency. Provided support in the in the JPY147.75-JPY148.00 area holds, the upside may attract into month- and quarter-end and ahead of the April 2 US tariff announcement.?

UK

Drivers:? Sterling has been beneficiary of the broad dollar pullback. It appreciated 7.35% from the January 13 low near $1.21 to stall recently slightly above $1.30, and five of the past seven weeks. The UK won praise for Prime Minister Starmer projecting UK leadership as the US strains the Atlantic alliance, his domestic policies are causing strain within the Labour government. Last week's move found GBP6 bln of savings by making it more difficult to claim benefits for physical and mental disabilities (Personal Independence Payments). It follows decisions to strip most pensioners of winter fuel payments and cuts overseas aid to boost defense spending.

Data:? This is a busy week for UK economic data. The highlights include the February CPI on Wednesday and Chancellor Reeves Spring budget statement on Thursday. In the three months through January, the UK CPI rose at an annualized rate of 1.2%. The base effect warns that the year-over-year rate is likely to recede in February and March from January's 3.0% pace. The UK's CPI rose by 0.6% last February and March. Reeves is under pressure from within the Labour Party to moderate her fiscal austerity. The Office of Budget Responsibility is expected to revise its economic projections lower before Reeve's statement. The UK will also report February retail sales. Some moderation is expected after the 1.7% surge in headline sales in January. The delayed January trade figures are due. The overall trade deficit is expected to have widened. There is some interest in its precious metals trade amid report of substantial gold shipments to the US. According to the Bloomberg survey, the trade deficit excluding precious metals may have narrowed to GBP2.0 bln from GBP2.275 bln in December.?

Prices: ?Sterling has trended higher over the past two months; the two-year Gilt yield has fallen by over 40 bp. The two-year yield rose every day last week, while sterling slipped for the first time in three weeks. Ahead of the weekend, sterling slipped below $1.29 for the first time March 11. The momentum indicators are rolling over. The break of $1.29, which may set the stage for a test on the $1.2840 area, which is where the 20-day moving average and (38.2%) retracement of this month's rally is found. Below there, the $1.2785-$1.2800 band that houses the 200-day moving average and the next retracement (50%)?

CANADA

Drivers: ?The threat and actual US tariffs imposed are a negative shock to Canada's economy. The shock is serving to extend the Bank of Canada's easing cycle. The swaps market has a little less than a 50% chance of another cut next month, but which time, the reciprocal and sectoral tariffs expected to be announced. The market has the next cut fully discounted by the end of July. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Carney heads up a minority government and seeks a popular mandate. It has been expected that he would call for an election before the prorogued parliament returns on Monday. Indeed, reported have emerged that Carney will make the announcement on Sunday, March 23. The likely election date appears to be late April, but early May is also possible.?

Data: ?Canada reports January's GDP in the only notable release in the last full week of March. The economy is expected to slow markedly this quarter from the 2.6% annualized pace seen in Q4 24. The median forecast in Bloomberg's survey is for 1.6%, which would be the slowest since the end of 2023. All the key components are seen slowing (consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports).?

Prices: ?Although last week's loss was minor (~0.10%), it was the third consecutive weekly decline of the greenback. That is its longest losing streak since last August. Nevertheless, as it continues to trace out a broad consolidation. Last week's low was near CAD1.4270, which is not even a new low for the month (That was set March 6 near CAD1.4240). The exchange rate appears to be tracing out a consolidative triangle pattern. Depending on precisely how it is drawn, the lower end may be found around CAD1.4285 at the end of the month. The upper end of the pattern is trickier. If drawn off the highs from this month, it comes in around CAD1.4475 at the end of March. A caveat is that the pattern is often subject to false breaks.?

Australia

Drivers: ?Australia's Prime Minister Albanese has ruled out reciprocal tariffs on the US for the steel and aluminum levies. He argues that they ultimately inflict self-harm. Australia exported about 10% of its steel and aluminum to the US last year. or about $1.1 bln of its total exports of about $600 bln. The Reserve Bank of Australia has begun a slow easing cycle. There is little chance of a cut at the next meeting on April 1, even after the poor employment report. Still, the futures market has slightly more than a 70% chance of a cut in May. Overall, the market two cuts discounted for the remainder of the year and about 2/3-chance of a third.

Data:? Australia sees its preliminary March PMI and the February monthly CPI print. After spending a couple of months in Q3 24 below the 50 boom/bust level, Australia's composite PMI remained above 50 in Q4 24. It reached 51.1 in January, its highest level since last August, before pulling back to 50.6 in February. Australia's monthly CPI peaked last year in May at 4.0%. It bottomed at 2.1% last September and October. It rose to 2.5% at the end of the year and remained there in January. It may have done so again in February. The trimmed mean measure peaked at 4.4% last May and fell to a three-year low of 2.7% at the end of 2024. It edged up to 2.8% in January. It was at 3.9% in February 2024. The central bank puts more emphasis on the quarterly CPI print, and the Q1 print is due at the end of next month.

Prices: ?The Australian dollar stalled at the start of last week near $0.6400, slightly shy of last month's high for Q1 near $0.6410 and the (38.2%) retracement of the Q4 slide that carried into the first part of January. The Aussie takes a four-day losing streak into next week. It settled at new lows for the week ahead of the weekend, a little below $0.6260, its lowest level since March 5. The trendline drawn off January and March lows comes in near $0.6245 at the start of the week and is closer to $0.6265 at the end of the month. A convincing break could signal a return to the $0.6170-$0.6200 area.?

Mexico

Drivers: Canada and Mexico have adopted different tactics to deal with the disruptions emanating from the US. The Trump administration has shown more respect for Mexico than Canada, but it does not have territorial ambitions for its southern neighbor. Mexico's Sheinbaum has pushed back against some of Trump's claims, ridiculed the ""Gulf of America"" nomenclature, and seeks legal action against US gun manufacturers. She cites US customs data regarding fentanyl confiscations and non-documented migrants. The peso has been unexpectedly resilient in the face of US actions and the slowing of its domestic economy.

Data:? Mexico reports CPI for the first half of March, January IGAE survey, which is similar to a monthly GDP report, January retail sales and February trade figures. The highlight is Thursday's central bank meeting. Banxico cut its overnight lending rate five times in 2024, beginning in March. With inflation back into its target rate, it delivered a 50 bp cut last month to bring it to 9.50%. The resilience of the peso may embolden the central bank to deliver another half-point cut now. We suspect it may signal scope for further cuts but likely at a slower pace. The swaps market has about 175 bp of cuts discounted over the next 12 months.

Prices:? The dollar rose by about 1.25% against the peso last week, its best showing since the end of January. The high for the week was set ahead of the weekend near MXN20.2755. At the end of the previous week, the greenback was at its lowest level since the US election last November (~MXN19.8475). The US dollar gains stalled near the 20-day moving average and the (38.2%) retracement this month's decline, near MXN20.2870. A move above there may spur gains toward MXN20.42-MXN20.50.?

Data: ?Canada reports January's GDP in the only notable release in the last full week of March. The economy is expected to slow markedly this quarter from the 2.6% annualized pace seen in Q4 24. The median forecast in Bloomberg's survey is for 1.6%, which would be the slowest since the end of 2023. All the key components are seen slowing (consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports).?

Prices: ?Although last week's loss was minor (~0.10%), it was the third consecutive weekly decline of the greenback. That is its longest losing streak since last August. Nevertheless, as it continues to trace out a broad consolidation. Last week's low was near CAD1.4270, which is not even a new low for the month (That was set March 6 near CAD1.4240). The exchange rate appears to be tracing out a consolidative triangle pattern. Depending on precisely how it is drawn, the lower end may be found around CAD1.4285 at the end of the month. The upper end of the pattern is trickier. If drawn off the highs from this month, it comes in around CAD1.4475 at the end of March. A caveat is that the pattern is often subject to false breaks.?

Australia

Drivers: ?Australia's Prime Minister Albanese has ruled out reciprocal tariffs on the US for the steel and aluminum levies. He argues that they ultimately inflict self-harm. Australia exported about 10% of its steel and aluminum to the US last year. or about $1.1 bln of its total exports of about $600 bln. The Reserve Bank of Australia has begun a slow easing cycle. There is little chance of a cut at the next meeting on April 1, even after the poor employment report. Still, the futures market has slightly more than a 70% chance of a cut in May. Overall, the market two cuts discounted for the remainder of the year and about 2/3-chance of a third.

Data:? Australia sees its preliminary March PMI and the February monthly CPI print. After spending a couple of months in Q3 24 below the 50 boom/bust level, Australia's composite PMI remained above 50 in Q4 24. It reached 51.1 in January, its highest level since last August, before pulling back to 50.6 in February. Australia's monthly CPI peaked last year in May at 4.0%. It bottomed at 2.1% last September and October. It rose to 2.5% at the end of the year and remained there in January. It may have done so again in February. The trimmed mean measure peaked at 4.4% last May and fell to a three-year low of 2.7% at the end of 2024. It edged up to 2.8% in January. It was at 3.9% in February 2024. The central bank puts more emphasis on the quarterly CPI print, and the Q1 print is due at the end of next month.

Prices: ?The Australian dollar stalled at the start of last week near $0.6400, slightly shy of last month's high for Q1 near $0.6410 and the (38.2%) retracement of the Q4 slide that carried into the first part of January. The Aussie takes a four-day losing streak into next week. It settled at new lows for the week ahead of the weekend, a little below $0.6260, its lowest level since March 5. The trendline drawn off January and March lows comes in near $0.6245 at the start of the week and is closer to $0.6265 at the end of the month. A convincing break could signal a return to the $0.6170-$0.6200 area.?

Mexico

Drivers: Canada and Mexico have adopted different tactics to deal with the disruptions emanating from the US. The Trump administration has shown more respect for Mexico than Canada, but it does not have territorial ambitions for its southern neighbor. Mexico's Sheinbaum has pushed back against some of Trump's claims, ridiculed the ""Gulf of America"" nomenclature, and seeks legal action against US gun manufacturers. She cites US customs data regarding fentanyl confiscations and non-documented migrants. The peso has been unexpectedly resilient in the face of US actions and the slowing of its domestic economy.

Data:? Mexico reports CPI for the first half of March, January IGAE survey, which is similar to a monthly GDP report, January retail sales and February trade figures. The highlight is Thursday's central bank meeting. Banxico cut its overnight lending rate five times in 2024, beginning in March. With inflation back into its target rate, it delivered a 50 bp cut last month to bring it to 9.50%. The resilience of the peso may embolden the central bank to deliver another half-point cut now. We suspect it may signal scope for further cuts but likely at a slower pace. The swaps market has about 175 bp of cuts discounted over the next 12 months.

Prices:? The dollar rose by about 1.25% against the peso last week, its best showing since the end of January. The high for the week was set ahead of the weekend near MXN20.2755. At the end of the previous week, the greenback was at its lowest level since the US election last November (~MXN19.8475). The US dollar gains stalled near the 20-day moving average and the (38.2%) retracement this month's decline, near MXN20.2870. A move above there may spur gains toward MXN20.42-MXN20.50.?

Stock of the Day: VRTS Market Insights, Feb. 22, 2015"
2025/3/22 17:02,Week Ahead: Is the Dollar Bottoming?,"Week Ahead: Is the Dollar Bottoming?Mar 22, 2025

After falling steadily since from the end of Q3 24 through the first part of January, the dollar stabilized last week, despite the dovish market takeaway from the Federal Reserve. The median projection for growth was shaved while the inflation project was raised. Still, despite the Atlanta Fed's GDP Now tracking a contraction here in Q1, few are that pessimistic. None of the 58 economists in Bloomberg's survey see a contraction, and only one estimate has growth below 2%. While many are talking about ""stagflation,"" it seems exaggerated. The median Fed projection sees growth slowing but only toward trend (1.8%), which is the estimate of the pace of non-inflationary growth. The tariffs are seen as a potential one-off (transitory) impact on prices. Even though inflation proving sticky, the Fed's median dot projection of the PCE deflator of 2.7% this year (up from 2.5% in 2024) and 2.2% is not the kind of price pressures associated with stagflation. The median forecast in Bloomberg's survey is lower than the Fed's seeing the deflator at 2.4% this year and 2.3% next year,?

Prices will be very much on investors' minds next week. The US reports the February PCE deflator, which is not so much new news given the ability of economists to forecast it fairly accurately after having the CPI and PPI in hand. The UK and Australia report February CPI. Tokyo reports March CPI which gives strong insight into national developments. Mexico reports inflation for the first half of March, but the highlight of the week will be the central bank's meeting on Thursday, and a 50 bp rate cut looks likely. There is bound to be last minute jockeying ahead of the April 2 US tariff announcement. Canada's Prime Minister Carney is expected to call for snap election on Sunday that could be set for either late April or early May.?

US

Drivers:US reciprocal tariffs and sectoral tariffs are threatened for April 2. Tariffs are understood to boost prices and weaken demand. Not only did the Chair Powell seem to play down the latter, but so are businesses and investors. Growth forecasts are being reduced. While surveys show elevated inflation expectations, market-based measures, such as the two- and10-year break-evens (the difference between the conventional yield and the yield of the inflation-protected security) are lower than where they finished last month and the 2-10-year yield curve is well with last month's range. After rallying from late last September through mid-January, the dollar has been trending broadly lower. Momentum indicators are getting stretched and the greenback's downside momentum has stalled.?

Data:February personal consumption data, durable goods orders (and shipments) and March survey data (several regional Fed reports, Conference Board, and the preliminary PMI) are due and they will help Q1 GDP forecasts. The Atlanta Fed's GDP tracker is still looking at a contraction, but it has been pared to -1.8%, but the lowest forecast in Bloomberg's survey (with 58 respondents) is for a 1.2% expansion. The CPI and PPI take most of the guesswork away from forecasting the PCE deflator, which the Fed targets. The headline will be little changed at 2.5%, while the core rate ticks up to 2.7% from 2.6%.

Prices:The Dollar Index has been confined to roughly a 103.20-104.15 range since March 7. It frayed the upper end of the range ahead of the weekend and settled above 104.00 for the first time since March 6. A key question is whether this sideways movement is the formation of a bottom or a nesting phase before the next leg down. With momentum indicators stretched, month- and quarter-end approaching, and the April 2 tariff announcements looming, we are more inclined to see it as a near-term bottoming pattern after about a 6.25% drop since January 13, a week before the inauguration. There may be near-term potential toward 104.90-105.00.

EMU

Drivers:The prospects for a cease fire in Russia's war on Ukraine and the political deal in Germany on military and infrastructure support have reduced near-term downside risks in the eurozone. These developments look to have been discounted. After rising by nearly 50 bp in the first two weeks of March, the 10-year German Bund yield slipped 12 bp last week, its largest weekly declines this year. The US two-year premium over Germany ended 2024 near 220 bp and at the end of February was about 180 bp. It bottomed earlier this month near 138 bp and rose for the second consecutive week and approached 150 bp.?

Data:? The flash March PMI is the data highlight. Recall that the composite rose to 50.2 in January and stayed there in February, its highest level since last August. It was at 49.6 in December and 50.3 in March 2024. The ECB reports the results of its inflation survey. In February, the median forecast was at 2.6% and 2.4% for the one- and three-year outlooks.

Prices:The euro made a marginal new high for the year last week near $1.0955, but the upside momentum stalled. It fell through $1.08 ahead of the weekend for the first time in a couple of weeks. With the momentum indicators turning lower and the firming of the US two-year premium over German, the risks seem to favor the euro's downside into month-end and ahead of the April 2 US tariff announcement. We suspect there is potential toward the $1.0700-25 area, where several technical levels converge.?

PRC

Drivers:Beijing wants neither a strong nor weak yuan. It wants a broadly stable one against the US dollar. One set of reasons why the PBOC has been reluctant to cut rates may be related to the exchange rate. Many international investors are under-weight Chinese stocks. The outperformance is giving international fund managers a new challenge. US efforts to curb Chinese technological advances seems to have largely failed. It is not only DeepSeek, but several other technological breakthroughs, including BDY's rapid EV charge, which reportedly is nearly as fast as refueling ICE. Two flashpoints are emerging. The first is whether Beijing formally blocks CK Hutchinson sales of ports to Blackrock, among which include the ports on both sides of the Panama Canal. The second is if Beijing prevents BYD from building a plant in Mexico for fear of losing its proprietary technology to the US.?

Data:?It is a light week for Chinese data and the main event is the setting of the one-year Medium-Term Lending Facility rate. It is expected to remain unchanged at 2.0%, but the lending amount may increase from CNY300 bln last month.?

Prices: The dollar rose for the first time in three weeks against the offshore yuan, which is consistent with its broadly firmer tone. It finished the week above the 20-day moving average (~CNH7.2530) and traded above CNH7.26 ahead of the weekend. The next hurdle is seen near CNH7.2700-25. The month's high is closer to CNH7.3075 and could be challenged if the greenback extends its recovery against the other major currencies, which, from a technical vantage point, looks like a reasonable scenario.?

Japan

Drivers:?The exchange rate often seems most sensitive to changing US and Japanese interest rates. The US 10-year premium over Japan peaked a few days after dollar did against the yen in early January near 360 bp. It is now near 270 bp after setting a two-and-a-half year low earlier this month a little below 265 bp. However, the correlation has weakened recently.?

Data:There are two highlights. The first is the preliminary March PMI that will begin the week. The market tends not to be particularly sensitive to the PMI, though the composite has risen for four consecutive months through February at 52.0, matched its best level since last August. The market is more sensitive to the other highlight, Tokyo's March CPI at the end of the week. While fresh food prices may have peaked, they still may be filtering through to processed foods and the costs of dining out. Still price pressures look little changed in March from February.?

Prices: The dollar rose against the yen in five of the past six sessions, but the 10-year US Treasury yield slipped every day last week. The US 10-year premium over Japan also narrowed in each session last week. The dollar pushed above JPY150 in the middle of last week but has not settled above it so far this month. Still, the momentum indicators are constructive and after falling by around 7.75% from January 10 through March 11, consolidative/corrective forces appear to have moved into ascendency. Provided support in the in the JPY147.75-JPY148.00 area holds, the upside may attract into month- and quarter-end and ahead of the April 2 US tariff announcement.?

UK

Drivers:Sterling has been beneficiary of the broad dollar pullback. It appreciated 7.35% from the January 13 low near $1.21 to stall recently slightly above $1.30, and five of the past seven weeks. The UK won praise for Prime Minister Starmer projecting UK leadership as the US strains the Atlantic alliance, his domestic policies are causing strain within the Labour government. Last week's move found GBP6 bln of savings by making it more difficult to claim benefits for physical and mental disabilities (Personal Independence Payments). It follows decisions to strip most pensioners of winter fuel payments and cuts overseas aid to boost defense spending.

Data:This is a busy week for UK economic data. The highlights include the February CPI on Wednesday and Chancellor Reeves Spring budget statement on Thursday. In the three months through January, the UK CPI rose at an annualized rate of 1.2%. The base effect warns that the year-over-year rate is likely to recede in February and March from January's 3.0% pace. The UK's CPI rose by 0.6% last February and March. Reeves is under pressure from within the Labour Party to moderate her fiscal austerity. The Office of Budget Responsibility is expected to revise its economic projections lower before Reeve's statement. The UK will also report February retail sales. Some moderation is expected after the 1.7% surge in headline sales in January. The delayed January trade figures are due. The overall trade deficit is expected to have widened. There is some interest in its precious metals trade amid report of substantial gold shipments to the US. According to the Bloomberg survey, the trade deficit excluding precious metals may have narrowed to GBP2.0 bln from GBP2.275 bln in December.?

Prices:Sterling has trended higher over the past two months; the two-year Gilt yield has fallen by over 40 bp. The two-year yield rose every day last week, while sterling slipped for the first time in three weeks. Ahead of the weekend, sterling slipped below $1.29 for the first time March 11. The momentum indicators are rolling over. The break of $1.29, which may set the stage for a test on the $1.2840 area, which is where the 20-day moving average and (38.2%) retracement of this month's rally is found. Below there, the $1.2785-$1.2800 band that houses the 200-day moving average and the next retracement (50%)?

CANADA

Drivers:The threat and actual US tariffs imposed are a negative shock to Canada's economy. The shock is serving to extend the Bank of Canada's easing cycle. The swaps market has a little less than a 50% chance of another cut next month, but which time, the reciprocal and sectoral tariffs expected to be announced. The market has the next cut fully discounted by the end of July. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Carney heads up a minority government and seeks a popular mandate. It has been expected that he would call for an election before the prorogued parliament returns on Monday. Indeed, reported have emerged that Carney will make the announcement on Sunday, March 23. The likely election date appears to be late April, but early May is also possible.?

Data:Canada reports January's GDP in the only notable release in the last full week of March. The economy is expected to slow markedly this quarter from the 2.6% annualized pace seen in Q4 24. The median forecast in Bloomberg's survey is for 1.6%, which would be the slowest since the end of 2023. All the key components are seen slowing (consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports).?

Prices:Although last week's loss was minor (~0.10%), it was the third consecutive weekly decline of the greenback. That is its longest losing streak since last August. Nevertheless, as it continues to trace out a broad consolidation. Last week's low was near CAD1.4270, which is not even a new low for the month (That was set March 6 near CAD1.4240).

 Macro Themes in Play
 ? The dollar index climbed for the third day on Friday, hitting a two-week high due to
short-covering following Fed comments and a shift towards safety ahead of the April 2 deadline
for reciprocal U.S. tariffs.
 ? New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said that monetary policy is appropriately
positioned at the moment, considering the economy's performance amid an uncertain outlook.
 ? Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller expressed his opposition to the central bank's
recent decision to slow the reduction of its securities holdings. 
 ? Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said it remains uncertain as to whether the Trump
administration's tariff plans will result in sustained inflation. 
 ? The risk tone improved marginally after President Donald Trump said that he plans to speak
with Chinese President Xi Jinping and the two leaders will talk about tariffs, adding that there
is some flexibility.
 ? EUR/USD is set for its first weekly loss in March since February 28 on softer bund yields and
as long positions are trimmed.
 ? Greek central bank chief Yannis Stournaras said a rate cut in April is increasingly likely
since inflation is slowing, wage growth is moderating and service price pressures are easing.
EUR/USD is hovering above the base of its 1.0796-1.0954 two-week range.
 ? Upcoming quarter-end flows and U.S. February PCE are seen as potential directional catalysts.
There will also be attention paid to progress on Ukraine ceasefire talks next week.
 ? Friday's pivot toward havens sent EUR/CHF lower, as well.
 ? GBP/USD dipped on Friday and may see further losses before the release of the UK budget on
March 26. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to reveal the largest spending cuts, further
challenging an already sluggish UK economic expansion.
 ? Associated pound weakness could see cable revisit its 200-day moving average at
1.2790-1.2800. The pair needs a close above 1.30 to entice bulls.  
 ? USD/JPY reversed an earlier loss, turning higher as Treasury yields firmed following Fed
comments. The pair holds a slight upward bias within a 148-150 range though haven-linked yen
demand may slow its advance.
 ? Longer-term bears are not seen exiting short positions until 151 is eclipsed. Japan data next
week, including services PPI and updated PMI, will be closely examined for any signs of changing
price trends. Additionally, the first-quarter Tankan report will be analyzed. 
 ? AUD/USD continues to trade defensively, slipping below its 55-day moving average at 0.6279 as
gold retreats and the offshore yuan weakens. China's central bank said it will cut banks'
reserve requirement ratio and interest rates at the ""appropriate time"" and strengthen the
resilience of its forex market.
 ? Treasury yields were mixed with the curve steepening. The 2s-10s curve was up about 3 basis
points to +30.7bp.
 ? The S&P 500 slid 0.39% on weakness in the materials sector
 ? Oil rose 0.41% on supply worries after U.S. sanctions on Iran and this week's OPEC+ output
plan.
 ? Gold slipped 0.77% while U.S. copper edged down 0.05% with the stronger dollar weighing on
metal prices    
 ? Heading toward the close: EUR/USD -0.30%, USD/JPY +0.27%, GBP/USD -0.32%, AUD/USD -0.43%, DXY
+0.30%, EUR/JPY +0.01%, GBP/JPY -0.02%, AUD/JPY -0.15%.

 GBP/USD downside risks grow leading into UK budget
 GBP/USD fell on Friday, closing out what has been a soft week as the dollar sees a modest
reprieve and 1.3000 has been a bridge too far, while risks are now skewed to the downside as UK
budget ahead looms on March 26.  The mood music surrounding the UK budget is downbeat. And with
talk that Chancellor Reeves is set to reveal the biggest spending cuts since austerity leaves
sterling in a precarious position as growth inhibiting measures will provide a further headwind
to the already anaemic growth. Though the recent Bank of England decision was a touch more
hawkish than expected the impact on sterling was negligible, given that the meeting ultimately
did not move the needle for the rate outlook. The central bank is still expected to deliver a
rate cut at the May meeting. Next week, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey will deliver a speech,
however, with the backdrop of heightened economic uncertainty, data will matter more in guiding
policy. That said, the door is open for cable to retest the 200-day moving average at
1.2790-1.2800. Topside momentum in the euro C which was a key proponent behind cable’s bid C has
stalled. Some traders are likely to reduce sterling exposure into the UK budget announcement,
while near-term factors favour a rebound in the dollar. Chart: https://tmsnrt.rs/4iot2FG
 
 U.S. February PCE could determine EUR/USD's next move
 EUR/USD traded lower Friday but remained within its recent consolidation range and above key
support near the 200-DMA and 1.0760/70 zone as investors awaited a catalyst, with U.S. February
PCE inflation due on March 28 a potential candidate to spark a move. Particular attention could
be placed on U.S. inflation data after the Fed's SEP lowered GDP projections but increased 2025
projections for price growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that tariffs could drive inflation
but that price increases could be transitory, which suggests policy makers could be looking past
U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff and trade policies and are more focused on growth.
Investors may also be looking past those influences. U.S. 2-year and 5-year break even inflation
rates have been trending downward since mid February, which has helped weigh down the U.S.
dollar as it is correlated with break evens. Month-on-month headline and core PCE are estimated
at +0.3, which would match January's result. Year-on-year core PCE is expected to rise to 2.7%
from 2.6% while headline is expected to match January's 2.5%. Below estimate or as expected
results could indicate disinflation is in place or ease investors concerns inflation is running
hot. If so, U.S. yields might sink and the dollar's yield advantage over the euro could decrease
as German-U.S. spreads and terminal rate spreads for the Fed and ECB tighten. EUR/USD may end
its consolidation phase and resume the broader up trend. Charts: https://tmsnrt.rs/4kXF1M6 and

 Chart of the day
 Yen looks set to firm as shares recoil  
 The yen is poised to strengthen as uncertainty weighs on investor sentiment. The Japanese
currency is seeing broad gains as risk appetite diminishes following a series of central bank
meetings this week. While the Swiss National Bank cut rates, most others left them unchanged.
Markets appears to be interpreting the relative indecision as a hawkish pause, with policymakers
struggling to define the inflation outlook due to tariffs and geopolitical tensions. While
investor unease is bolstering the yen's haven status, its rise is being tempered by unusually
long positions and low volatility. CFTC data expected on Friday will likely show net longs near
record levels, even after paring positions during this week's quarterly rolls. One-month yen
volatility is only pricing in modest risk ahead of the U.S. reciprocal tariff deadline on April
2. Volatility is also subdued by USD/JPY being near the midpoint of its range since September
and the possibility that future Fed cuts could restore investor confidence. The risks for the
yen bulls include potential deterioration in Japan's economic data or rising resource prices
keeping short-term yields outside Japan elevated. Japan's flash PMI for March, due on Monday,
will provide further insights. USD/JPY is holding steady near a descending 21-day moving average
at 148.88, following a series of bearish candles around the 150 level. Downside risks are
expected to increase after significant 148 options expire on April 3. However, the medium-term
direction will likely be determined by a close outside the 148-150 range. Chart: https://tmsnrt.rs/4iLavmK

2025/3/21 14:21,"Рубль скромничает под вечер пятницы, дорожая по итогам волатильной недели","МОСКВА, 21 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль под вечер пятницы
сократил внутрисессионные потери и показывает незначительные
изменения на Мосбирже, сохраняя изначально скромную позитивную
динамику на внешних рынках - на его стороне играет возможное
насыщение спроса на сильно подешевевшую за первую половину
недели иностранную валюту, а также набор потенциально позитивных
для российской валюты факторов.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 17.00 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,51, и российская валюта
теряет 0,1%. Перед полуднем рубль дешевел до 11,64, а днем
заходил в зеленую зону, укрепляясь до 11,46.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 17.00 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 84,60, и рубль набирает 0,4%.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> находится сейчас на форексе вблизи
отметки 91,60, и здесь рубль набирает 0,6%.
    Рубль находится в полшаге от роста по итогам оказавшейся
весьма волатильной недели, в течение которой он достиг во
вторник свежих максимумов с прошлого июня, 81,00 за доллар и
88,88 за евро на форексе, а также 11,13 за юань на Мосбирже, но
уже в среду показал сильнейшее сессионное падение к ключевым
валютам в нынешнем году, на 2,5-2,8%, в обоих случаях отражая
преимущественно динамику спекулятивных потоков в ожидании
телефонных переговоров глав США и РФ, и затем по их факту.
    Свою роль в скачке волатильности на завершающейся неделе мог
сыграть и фактор квартальной экспирации валютных фьючерсов на
Мосбирже в четверг.
    Сегодня же рубль достаточно вяло отреагировал на решение
российского Центробанка сохранить ключевую ставку на уровне 21%
и достаточно жесткое сопроводительное послание регулятора, но
формально такой высокий ее уровень косвенно поддерживает курс
российской валюты, поскольку продолжает охлаждать внутренний
потребительский спрос, что в том числе приводит к сокращению
покупок инвалюты импортерами.
    Основной же поддержкой рублю выступают надежды на скорое
завершение украинского конфликта, а также ожидания улучшения
отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом с последующей возможностью
ослабления американских рестрикций против России, хотя этот
геополитический фактор таит риски непредсказуемости.
    Внешнеполитическая повестка остается в фокусе внимания, в
частности, важной представляется запланированная на 24 марта
новая встреча делегаций США и РФ в Саудовской Аравии, которая
может стать очередным шагом к нормализации отношений Москвы и
Вашингтона, усиливая ожидания последующего ослабления
американских санкций в отношении России.
    На следующей неделе в пользу рубля будет выступать возможная
активация продаж валютной выручки экспортерами под уплату
налогов 28 марта, при этом в текущем месяце сырьевые корпорации
проводят окончательные расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том
числе уплачивают налог на дополнительный доход за четвертый
квартал почти на полтриллиона рублей.
    Внутренней перманентной поддержкой рублю остаются ежедневные
нетто-продажи китайской валюты Центробанком в рамках
зеркалирования трат из ФНБ и проведения операций по бюджетному
правилу. В марте  регулятор продает юани почти на 6 миллиардов
рублей в день.

европейской экономики.
    Кеннет Бру из Societe Generale, сказал, что движение евро в
пятницу в основном объясняется фиксацией прибыли.
    ""В целом мы наблюдаем паузу в корректировках позиций с
выходом из долларовых активов, что также заметно на валютном
рынке, где евро начал откатывать часть роста, наблюдавшегося с
конца января"", - сказал Бру.
    Крупные центральные банки развитых рынков начинают проявлять
осторожность после ряда снижений стоимости заимствований , а
также на фоне роста неопределенности в мировой экономике и
политике.
    На этой неделе крупнейшие центробанки, включая ФРС, Банк
Англии и Банк Японии, сохранили прежние уровни процентных
ставок, оценивая экономические последствия торговых пошлин,
введенных президентом США Дональдом Трампом против мировых
торговых партнеров.
    Между тем ожидается, что новый раунд ответных пошлин
Вашингтона вступит в силу 2 апреля.
    ""По мере приближения объявления 2 апреля возрастает
вероятность того, что участники рынка сократят ""шорты"" в долларе

сохранить ключевую ставку на уровне 21%, при этом регулятор
допускает, что если динамика дезинфляции не будет обеспечивать
достижение цели, то совет директоров рассмотрит вопрос о
повышении ключевой ставки, тогда как прежний сигнал регулятора
был жестче. ЦБР также отметил, что произошедшее с начала года
укрепление рубля уже сдерживает рост цен в феврале и начале
марта.
    Формально высокая ключевая ставка ЦБР может охлаждать

2025/3/21 10:20,Рубль показывает смешанную динамику непосредственно перед решением ЦБР,"МОСКВА, 21 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль под занавес волатильной
недели безыдейно показывает смешанную динамику в ожидании итогов
сегодняшнего совета директор Банка России, которые станут
известны в 13.30 МСК, а на 15.00 запланирована пресс-конференция
руководства регулятора.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 13.10 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,56, российская валюта теряет
0,5%.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к 13.10 МСК
котировались вблизи отметок 11,56, 86,20 и 93,30 соответственно,
и рубль теряет 0,3% к юаню, 0,2% к доллару, и показывает
минимальные изменения против евро.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 13.20 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 84,75, и рубль набирает 0,2%.
    Пара доллар/рубль на внебиржевом российском валютном рынке к
этому времени котировалась в диапазоне 84,00-84,85, согласно
усредненным данным российских поставщиков финансовых услуг.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> находится сейчас на форексе вблизи
отметки 91,75, и здесь рубль набирает 0,4%. На российском же
межбанке евро сейчас котируется в диапазоне 90,30-92,00 рубль.
    Инвесторы и аналитики в большинстве своем ждут сохранения
ключевой ставки на уровне 21%, но допускают ""голубиную"" риторику
регулятора по итогам заседания и намеки на возможное снижение
стоимости кредита уже в ближайшей перспективе на фоне сигналов о
замедлении инфляции и улучшении геополитической ситуации.
    ""ЦБР, вероятно, сохранит ставку, но смягчит риторику/сигнал,
что позволит нейтрализовать жесткость предыдущего сигнала и
подготовить рынок к возможному снижению номинальной ставки в
апреле-июне. Это вполне себе консенсусный  взгляд из
соображений, как ЦБР должен поступить, чтобы не нарушить текущую
коммуникацию"", - полагает Дмитрий Полевой из компании Астра УА.
    Формально смягчение ДКП центробанками играет против
национальных валют, но на практике, в текущих российских
условиях и с учетом наблюдаемых сейчас внешнеполитических
подвижек, такие действия Банка России могут подыграть курсу
рубля на короткой дистанции, а негативный эффект проявится
позднее, уже после реального снижения ключевой ставки.
    На текущей неделе рубль достиг во вторник свежих максимумов
с прошлого июня, 81,00 за доллар и 88,88 за евро на форексе, а
также 11,13 за юань на Мосбирже, но в среду показал сильнейшее
сессионное падение к ключевым валютам в нынешнем году, на
2,5-2,8%, в обоих случаях отражая динамику спекулятивных потоков
в ожидании переговоров глав США и РФ, и затем по их факту.
    Участники рынка также отмечали в первой половине текущей
недели достаточно крупные продажи экспортной выручки и спрос на
российские активы со стороны инвесторов из ""дружественных""
стран, а после падения иностранной валюты на локальное дно -
значительное усиление ее покупок импортерами и физлицами.
    Поддержку российской валюте далее может оказывать уплата
налогов 28 марта, при этом в текущем месяце сырьевые корпорации
проводят окончательные расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том
числе уплачивают налог на дополнительный доход за четвертый
квартал почти на полтриллиона рублей.
    Геополитическая повестка остается в фокусе внимания, в
частности, важной представляется запланированная на 24 марта
новая встреча делегаций США и РФ в Саудовской Аравии, которая
может стать очередным шагом к нормализации отношений Москвы и
Вашингтона, усиливая ожидания последующего ослабления
американских санкций в отношении России. 
    ""В краткосрочной перспективе мы ждем консолидацию курса
рубля вблизи текущих уровней и уже на следующей неделе, на фоне
вероятных позитивных геополитических сигналов, развития новой
волны укрепления национальной валюты"", - резюмирует Денис Попов
из ПСБ.

过日内的波幅还是可以的，”一中资行交易员称。
    
    该交易员并表示，中美尚未就关税进行对话或谈判，人民币难出方向；但美指此前大幅
下行后，汇价的压力总体减轻了不少。
    
    一外资行交易称，“短期人民币估计就是这样，上有顶下有底，...4月对等关税出来，
不知道市场会怎么动。”
   
      
    花旗银行认为，如果额外关税继续生效，估计人民币的贬值压力会加大，当然中国央行
也不会放任不管，央行或仍不会让汇价跌破7.33的前期低点；该行预计，人民币汇率三个月
内可能触及7.4关口，但6-12月的汇率目标仍会回落至7.3。
       
     Pepperstone研究主管Chris Weston表示，“随着特朗普宣布实施对等关税日期4月2日
的临近，市场参与者削减美元空头头寸并寻求更中立头寸的风险正在增加。”

2025/3/21 7:32,"Asia markets mixed after Wall Street dips as growth, tariff worries weigh","Asia markets mixed after Wall Street dips as growth, tariff worries weighAsia-Pacific markets mixed on Friday, a negative session on Wall Street Thursday limited the gain as traders cautiously digested the latest U.S. economic data amid concerns over President Trump's tariffs.

Markets are also bracing for the April 2 deadline for Trump's reciprocal tariffs on nations that have levied duties on US goods, adding to global trade concerns.

Japan (NKY:IND) fell 0.08% to 37,764, while the broader Topix Index rose 0.4% to 2,807 in post-holiday trade on Friday. The Japanese yen slipped to around 149 per dollar on Friday, snapping a two-day advance as investors reacted to the latest inflation figures.

Japan's core inflation rate slowed to 3% in February from 3.2% in January but still exceeded forecasts of 2.9%. This marked the second consecutive month that inflation surpassed expectations.

China (SHCOMP) fell 1.15% to around 3,400, while the Shenzhen Component dropped 0.6% to 10,810 on Friday, marking a third consecutive session of losses as investors engaged in profit-taking, and the offshore yuan depreciated past 7.25 per dollar on Friday, hitting its lowest level in over a week

Hong Kong (HSI) fell 2.23% to 23,929 in Friday morning trade, marking their second straight session of decline as all sectors retreated.

India (SENSEX) rose 0.68% to 76,655 in Friday's morning session, gaining for the fifth straight session amid almost broad sector gains led by the media and realty sector.

Australia (AS51) rose 0.17% to around 7,925 on Friday, extending gains from the previous session, with heavyweight retailers leading the advance. The Australian dollar weakened past $0.63 on Friday, sliding for the fourth straight session, as caution dominated sentiment amid rising global economic and trade concerns.

In the U.S., on Thursday, all three major indexes ended lower giving back some of the prior session's gains as investors reassessed economic risks and the Fed's response to potential inflation and slowing growth.

U.S. stock futures edged higher on Friday, with the S&P 500 on track to snap a four-week losing streak: Dow -0.08%; S&P 500 -0.08%; Nasdaq -0.07%.

Meanwhile, OPEC+ announced plans of output cuts for seven members, reducing 189,000C435,000 bpd monthly until June 2026.

Currencies: (JPY:USD), (CNY:USD), (AUD:USD), (INR:USD), (HKD:USD), (NZD:USD).

More on Asia:

 * 
 * People's Bank of China keeps lending rates unchanged, in line with expectations
 * Australia's Feb unemployment rate remains unchanged at 4.1%, aligning with expectations
 * Japan's trade balance swung to surplus in February, driven by strong exports
 * Bank of Japan keeps interest rates unchanged at 0.5%, as widely expected

Japan's core inflation rate slows to 3% in February, exceeds forecast; food prices slow slightly

2025/3/21 6:32,Рубль под занавес волатильной недели ждет итоги совета директоров ЦБР,"МОСКВА, 21 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль в пятницу утром
показывает смешанную динамику на внешних площадках, под занавес
волатильной недели переключая внимание на сегодняшний совет
директоров ЦБР, итоги которого станут известны в 13.30 МСК.
    Инвесторы и аналитики в массе своей ждут сохранения ключевой
ставки на уровне 21%, но допускают ""голубиную"" риторику
регулятора по итогам заседания и намеки на снижение стоимости
кредита уже в ближайшей перспективе на фоне сигналов о
замедлении инфляции и улучшении геополитической ситуации. 
    Формально смягчение ДКП центробанками играет против
национальных валют, но на практике, в текущих российских
условиях и с учетом наблюдаемых сейчас внешнеполитических
подвижек такие действия Банка России могут подыграть курсу рубля
на короткой дистанции, а негативный эффект проявится позднее,
уже после реального снижения ключевой ставки.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 9.20 МСК котировалась на форексе
вблизи отметки 84,90, что близко от закрытия четверга, по итогам
которого она потеряла 1,1%.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется по 91,97, и рубль
набирает 0,2% от уровня закрытия четверга, по итогам которого
российская валюта ослабела на 0,6%. 
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 11,20, и рубль теряет 0,6%.
    Вчерашние торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра""
завершились на уровне 11,50 рубля за юань - российская валюта в
итоге потеряла менее 0,1% при объеме сделок в 110 миллиардов
рублей, но в течение сессии слабея до отметки 11,66.
    Рубль накануне отразил повышенный локальный спрос на
подешевевшую за последнее время иностранную валюту, а также
продолжавшееся краткосрочное позиционирование из длинного рубля
в ожидании дальнейшего развития геополитической повестки. Свою
роль играл и фактор квартальной экспирации валютных фьючерсов на
Мосбирже в четверг днем, после чего спотовые биржевые котировки
российской валюты начали стабилизироваться, и также она
отскочила от сессионных минимумов на внебиржевом рынке.
    На текущей неделе рубль достиг свежих максимумов с прошлого
июня, но затем показал и сильнейшее сессионного падение в
нынешнем году, в основном отражая динамику спекулятивных потоков
в ожидании переговоров глав США и РФ, а потом по их факту.
    Участники рынка также отмечали в первой половине текущей
неделе достаточно крупные продажи экспортной выручки и спрос на
российские активы со стороны инвесторов из ""дружественных""
стран, а после падения иностранной валюты на локальное дно -
значительное усиление ее покупок импортерами и физлицами.
    Геополитическая повестка остается в фокусе внимания, в
частности, важной представляется запланированная на 24 марта
новая встреча делегаций США и РФ в Саудовской Аравии, которая
может стать очередным шагом к нормализации отношений Москвы и
Вашингтона, усиливая ожидания последующего ослабления
американских санкций в отношении России. 
    Поддержку российской валюте в ближайшее дни может оказывать
фактор корпоративных налоговых выплат 28 марта, при этом в
текущем месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят окончательные
расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе уплачивают налог
на дополнительный доход за четвертый квартал почти на
полтриллиона рублей, что может потребовать повышенных продаж
экспортной валютной выручки за рубли.
    Тем временем, на внешних рынках нефть продолжает рост после
существенного подорожания накануне. Баррель Brent <LCOc1> сейчас
растет почти на полпроцента и котируется по $72,34, а накануне
он набрал в цене 1,7%.
    На форексе индекс доллара <=USD> оценивается в 104,10, что
почти на треть процента выше последних значений четверга.
    Пара евро/доллар <EUR=> котируется по $1,0824, дешевея на
четверть процента.

       路透上海3月21日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周五早盘小幅下跌，盘中短暂触及7.2524的一周低点，中间价小跌6点触两个月新低，和路透预测偏离超650点。交易员表示，美国初请失业金人数显示劳动力市场仍稳，美联储不着急降息支撑美元多头人气，人民币外部压力略增，但估计下月初之前仍以稳为主。
    
    “短期人民币估计就是这样，上有顶下有底，”一外资行交易员称，“4月对等关税出来，不知道市场会怎么动。”
    
    花旗银行认为，如果额外关税继续生效，估计人民币的贬值压力会加大，当然中国央行也不会放任不管，央行或仍不会让汇价跌破7.33的前期低点；该行预计，人民币汇率三个月内可能触及7.4关口，但6-12月的汇率目标仍会回落至7.3。
    
    隔夜美国公布的上周初请失业金人数仅小幅上升，暗示3月就业市场仍保持稳定，不过随着贸易紧张局势加剧和政府支出大幅削减，就业市场前景黯淡。
    
    银河证券最新观点认为，市场关注焦点仍在特朗普政策，关税和财政紧缩两个关键因素的影响将在后续的通胀和经济数据中显现。“特朗普执意推进大规模关税及大幅的削减赤字，10Y美债收益率可能降低至4%以下。”
    
    Pepperstone研究主管Chris Weston表示，“随着特朗普宣布实施对等关税日期4月2日的临近，市场参与者削减美元空头头寸并寻求更中立头寸的风险正在增加。”
    
    近期美元/人民币期权波动率稳步回落，也有交易员认为，当前市场对4月特朗普的关税举措预期太过乐观。
    
    美联储周三将指标隔夜利率区间维持在4.25%-4.50%，承认美国经济存在不确定性。不过，决策者暗示，他们仍预期在年底前将降息0.5个百分点。目前交易员们预计美联储今年将降息约63个基点。
    
    全球汇市方面，美元兑主要货币周五上涨，上日美元创下三周以来最大涨幅，因美联储表示不急于降息。[FRX/CN]

    银河证券最新观点认为，当前市场的关键仍然是特朗普的政策，关税和财政紧缩两个关键因素的影响将在后续的通胀和经济数据中显现。“特朗普执意推进大规模关税及大幅的赤字缩减，10Y美债收益率可能降低至4%以下。”
    
    
    美联储周三将指标隔夜利率区间维持在4.25%-4.50%，承认美国经济存在不确定性。不过，决策者暗示，他们仍预期在年底前将降息0.5个百分点。目前交易员们预计美联储今年将降息约63个基点。
    
    全球汇市方面，美元指数<.DXY>周五亚洲早盘暂时在103.80上方交投，当前美国就业市场仍平稳，但关税和裁员举措料继续冲淡市场对美元向好预期。[FRX/CN](完)

2025/3/21 0:27,路透测算的人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>今日料开在7.2423元附近,"路透上海3月21日 - 路透根据中国外汇交易中心(CFETS)公布的人民币汇率形成机制测算，人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周五预计会开在7.2423元附近，较上日贬值约669点。
    
    隔夜美国公布的初请失业金人数略有增加，劳动力市场持稳，美联储不着急降息的预期助力美元反弹，人民币的外部压力有所上升，监管料对人民币中间价的单边预期继续过滤，但弹性有可能上升，整体延续有保有放的思路。

    上日人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>收报7.2383元，而中间价则为7.1754元。根据定价机制，今日中间价变动中，有629点下跌反映市场供求影响，另有40点下跌反映的是隔夜一篮子汇率基本保持不变所需要的点数；“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。

    路透测算的上日人民币兑美元中间价为7.2402元，和外汇交易中心公布的实际值偏差648点。上日路透根据CFETS公布的中间价测算，人民币汇率CFETS指数、参考SDR（特别提款权）篮子指数和参考BIS(国际清算银行)篮子指数分别为98.58、92.69和104.82。

    上日(截至北京时间次日凌晨3点)人民币兑美元即期累计成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为470.04亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

2025/3/20 23:27,BUZZ-Asia Day Ahead-Firmer dollar and subdued risk appetite lead,"March 21 (Reuters) - A broadly stronger U.S. dollar on the Federal
Reserve's decision to stay the course on interest rates, a spate of central bank
rate decisions and subdued risk appetite on tariff uncertainty characterised
trading on Thursday.
    Wall Street sagged, Treasury yields slipped, the U.S. dollar rallied and
commodities were mixed.
    Caution is likely to prevail in Asia after the mixed offshore lead as
traders look to Sunday's talks in Jeddah between the U.S. and Russia on the
Ukraine war with President Donald Trump saying that peace efforts were going
""pretty well"".
    Japan's February CPI highlights a fairly busy regional data schedule as
Tokyo returns from a holiday. The data will shape Bank of Japan rate
expectations after the central bank noted on Wednesday that wage and food price
gains may affect underlying inflation. 
    Dow -0.03%, S&P -0.22%, and Nasdaq -0.33% after Fed Chair Jerome Powell on
Wednesday highlighted ""unusually elevated"" uncertainty. Treasury yields eased as
the economic outlook remains murky; 2yr -1bp to 3.9660%, 10yr -1.5bp to 4.2410%
and 30yr -1bp to 4.5590%.
    Oil firmed after the U.S. issued new Iran-related sanctions, Brent +1.72%
and WTI +1.64%,. U.S. copper +0.25% after hitting its highest since May.
Safe-haven gold eased 0.1% on profit-taking after a new record high.
    The U.S. dollar <=USD> firmed +0.4% on the Fed's steady-for-longer rates
policy. EUR -0.45%, GBP -0.3% after the Bank of England held rates and flagged
greater uncertainty, JPY -0.1%, CHF -0.5% on the Swiss National Bank's
quarter-point rate cut, AUD -0.85% on soft jobs data, NZD -0.95%, CAD flat and
CNH -0.3%.

2025/3/20 14:53,ОБОБЩЕНИЕ-Рубль сник в ожидании геополитических новостей и притока экспортной выручки,"(Добавлены подробности и комментарии)
       МОСКВА, 20 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль дешевеет в четверг с
учетом баланса денежных потоков, среди которых были малозаметны
продажи экспортной выручки и преобладал локальный спрос на
подешевевшую за последнее время иностранную валюту, а также в
ожидании развития геополитической повестки.
    Свою роль в ослаблении рубля вчера и сегодня мог играть
фактор квартальной экспирации валютных фьючерсов на Мосбирже в
четверг днем, после чего спотовые биржевые котировки российской
валюты начали стабилизироваться, а также она отскочила от
сессионных минимумов на внебиржевом рынке.
    Пара юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 17.45 МСК котировалась
на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,54, и российская валюта теряет
0,3%, ранее дешевея до 11,66.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 17.45 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 84,92, и рубль теряет 1,1%, ранее дешевея до 85,75.
    Пара доллар/рубль на внебиржевом российском валютном рынке к
этому времени котировалась вокруг отметки 85 рублей, согласно
усредненным данным российских поставщиков финансовых услуг.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> находится сейчас на форексе вблизи
уровня 91,92, и рубль теряет 0,4%, ранее дешевея до 93,04. На
российском межбанке евро сейчас котируется в диапазоне
91,10-92,70 рубль.
    Рубль сегодня дешевеет в более спокойном режиме, чем в
среду, по итогам которой он показал сильнейшее с конца прошлого
года сессионное падение: накануне он потерял на форексе 2,8% в
паре с долларом и 2,4% к евро, и 2,5% в биржевой паре с юанем на
фоне агрессивного закрытия длинных рублевых позиций по итогам не
ставших прорывными переговоров глав США и России, а также из-за
локального спроса на значительно подешевевшую в предыдущие дни
инвалюту.
    Позавчера же рубль взлетел в преддверии телефонных
переговоров Дональда Трампа и Владимира Путина до отметок 81,00
за доллар и 88,88 за евро на форексе, а также 11,13 за юань на
Мосбирже - максимальных значений российской валюты с июня
прошлого года.
    Геополитическая повестка остается в фокусе внимания, в
частности, продвижение к российско-украинскому перемирию после
поочередных переговоров президента США Дональда Трампа с его
российским и украинским коллегами, Владимиром Путиным и
Владимиром Зеленским. 
    Важной представляется и запланированная на 24 марта новая
встреча делегаций США и РФ в Саудовской Аравии, которая может
стать очередным шагом к нормализации отношений Москвы и
Вашингтона, усиливая ожидания последующего ослабления
американских санкций в отношении России.
    На стороне рубля также выступает высокая ключевая ставка
ЦБР, охлаждающая внутренний потребительский спрос, что приводит
к сокращению импортных закупок. Согласно опросу Рейтер,
Центробанк по итогам завтрашнего совета директоров сохранит ее
на уровне 21%.
    ""Локальные инвесторы ждут пятничного решения по ставке ЦБР и
воскресной встречи высокопоставленных представителей США и
России в Саудовской Аравии"", - резюмировал Джон Уолш из
Альфа-Банка.
    Поддержку российской валюте в ближайшее дни может оказывать
фактор корпоративных налоговых выплат 28 марта, при этом в
текущем месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят окончательные
расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе уплачивают налог
на дополнительный доход за четвертый квартал почти на
полтриллиона рублей, что может потребовать повышенных продаж
экспортной валютной выручки за рубли.
    По мнению Евгения Локтюхова из ПСБ, на следующей неделе
может наблюдаться навес экспортной выручки под выплату налогов,
что поспособствует новым попыткам юаня и доллара направиться к
отметкам 11 и 80 рублей соответственно, если не будет негатива
по итогам встречи делегаций США и России в Саудовской Аравии.

сейчас котируется в диапазоне 90,30-92,10 рубль.
    По мнению Евгения Локтюхова из банка ПСБ, технически валюты
выглядят перепроданными, что с учетом сегодняшней экспирации
фьючерсов может привести к росту их рублевого курса.
    Он считает, что рублевые котировки юаня и доллара сегодня
будут меняться в диапазонах 11,40-11,80 и 83,00-85,00
соответственно.
    Рубль дешевеет, хотя и не столь существенно, как в среду, по
итогам которой он показал сильнейшее с конца прошлого года
сессионное падение: накануне он потерял на форексе 2,8% в паре с
долларом и 2,4% к евро, и 2,5% в биржевой паре с юанем на фоне
агрессивного закрытия длинных рублевых позиций по итогам не
ставших прорывными переговоров глав США и России, а также из-за
локального спроса на значительно подешевевшую в предыдущие дни
инвалюту.
    Позавчера же рубль взлетел в преддверии телефонных
переговоров Дональда Трампа и Владимира Путина до отметок 81,00
за доллар и 88,88 за евро на форексе, а также 11,13 за юань на
Мосбирже - максимальных значений российской валюты с июня
прошлого года.
    Геополитическая повестка остается в фокусе внимания, в
частности, продвижение к российско-украинскому перемирию после
поочередных переговоров президента США Дональда Трампа с его
российским и украинским коллегами, Владимиром Путиным и
Владимиром Зеленским. 
    Важной представляется и запланированная на воскресенье новая
встреча делегаций США и РФ в Саудовской Аравии, которая может
стать очередным шагом к нормализации отношений Москвы и
Вашингтона, усиливая ожидания последующего ослабления
американских санкций в отношении России.
    На стороне рубля также выступает высокая ключевая ставка
ЦБР, охлаждающая внутренний потребительский спрос, что приводит
к сокращению импортных закупок. Согласно опросу Рейтер,
Центробанк в пятницу сохранит ее на уровне 21%.
    ""Локальные инвесторы ждут пятничного решения по ставке ЦБР и
воскресной встречи высокопоставленных представителей США и
России в Саудовской Аравии"", - резюмировал Джон Уолш из
Альфа-Банка.
    Поддержку российской валюте в ближайшее дни может оказывать
фактор корпоративных налоговых выплат 28 марта, при этом в
текущем месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят окончательные
расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе уплачивают налог
на дополнительный доход за четвертый квартал почти на
полтриллиона рублей, что может потребовать повышенных продаж
экспортной валютной выручки за рубли.
    По мнению Локтюхова из ПСБ, на следующей неделе может
наблюдаться навес экспортной выручки под выплату налогов, что
будет способствовать новым попыткам юаня и доллара направиться к
отметкам 11 и 80 рублей соответственно, если не будет негатива
по итогам встречи делегаций США и России в Саудовской Аравии.

2025/3/20 8:37,China's central bank holds rates steady amid US tariffs and yuan weakness,"China's central bank holds rates steady amid US tariffs and yuan weaknessMar 20, 2025

China’s central bank decided to keep key lending rates unchanged on Thursday, holding firm as the country deals with a weakened yuan, new US trade tariffs, and an economy that is still trying to stabilize.

The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) left the 1-year loan prime rate (LPR) at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%, the same levels they have been at since the quarter-point cut in October.

This decision follows the US Federal Reserve’s move to keep its benchmark rates unchanged, though the Fed has signaled that rate cuts totaling half a percentage point are expected through 2025. Meanwhile, China is trying to hold off on easing too soon as the yuan faces downward pressure from global financial uncertainty and higher US tariffs.

PBOC keeps rates unchanged as trade war escalates

The People’s Bank of China calculates its LPR rates based on monthly submissions from designated commercial lenders. The 1-year LPR is used to price most business and household loans, while the 5-year LPR serves as a benchmark for mortgages.

At the same time, the PBOC’s 7-day reverse repo rate has remained at 1.5% since October, showing the central bank’s effort to keep liquidity stable while avoiding further drops in the yuan’s value.

The yuan has already weakened nearly 1.8% since Donald Trump won re-election in November. The offshore yuan, which hit a 16-month low in January, has seen a slight recovery but remains fragile as new tariffs threaten China’s export sector.

Following the PBOC’s rate announcement, the yuan remained relatively unchanged at 7.2280 per dollar, while Chinese 10-year government bond yields dropped over 2 basis points to 1.932%.

“Policymakers recognize the country’s robust growth momentum while remaining cautious due to persistent pressures ahead,” said Bruce Pang, an adjunct associate professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He pointed to risks from trade tensions, Federal Reserve policies, and already-thin margins at Chinese banks.

Inflation weakness fuels speculation of future rate cuts

China’s economy has shown some improvement in early 2024. Retail sales grew 4.0% year-over-year in January and February, rising from the 3.7% increase in December. Industrial production also came in stronger than expected, expanding 5.9% from a year earlier.

However, inflation data suggests that growth may still need policy support. In February, consumer price inflation fell into negative territory, marking the first decline in over a year. Producer prices also remained in deflation, raising concerns that demand is weakening despite Beijing’s push to stimulate domestic consumption.

“With the stronger call to support consumption, there is a growing chance that China will cut rates in the next meeting or so,” said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis. “If retail and home sales do not improve, especially if inflation stays weak, we may see a rate cut as early as April.”

Trump’s latest tariffs are adding pressure to China’s already uncertain economic outlook. The US President imposed a 20% tariff on Chinese imports and has threatened more in early April. This has raised concerns about China’s export sector, one of the few bright spots in its economy. In January and February, exports slowed more than expected, while imports saw their sharpest decline since mid-2023.

Beijing weighs policy response as global pressure builds

China’s top officials have signaled that more monetary easing could be on the way this year, with interest rate cuts at an appropriate time. Beijing has set a 5% growth target, but achieving that may require additional stimulus.

Goldman Sachs expects two 20-basis-point cuts to the LPR in the second and fourth quarters of 2024. The bank also predicts two 50-basis-point reductions in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), which determines how much cash banks must hold in reserves.

PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng has stressed that the central bank wants to keep the yuan stable, saying it must stay at a “reasonable and balanced level”. Preventing the currency from weakening too fast could also be part of China’s strategy ahead of potential trade negotiations with Trump to prevent further tariff hikes.

Despite stronger stock market performance in China, investors remain cautious. The MSCI China index has gained 19% in 2025, marking its best start to a year ever, according to Goldman Sachs. But regulatory worries and concerns about the health of the Chinese economy still weigh heavily on market sentiment.

2025/3/20 7:49,Юань снижается на фоне самого слабого фиксинга за два месяца,"ШАНХАЙ, 20 мар (Рейтер) - Китайский юань снижается в
паре с долларом в четверг - центральный банк Китая объявил самый
слабый фиксированный курс за два месяца, что свидетельствует о
стремлении властей предотвратить резкий рост валюты на фоне
падения ""зеленого"".
    Перед открытием сессии ЦБ Китая объявил срединный
фиксированный курс <CNY=PBOC> на уровне 7,1754 за доллар - самый
слабый с момента инаугурации президента США Дональда Трампа 20
января.
    Ослабление фиксинга не означает, что ЦБ Китая отступил от
политики поддержания стабильности валюты, особенно в преддверии

The Shanghai Composite fell 0.2% to 3,420, while the Shenzhen Component dropped 0.3% to 10,940 on Thursday, extending losses from the previous session as the People's Bank of China left key lending rates unchanged, in line with expectations, and the offshore yuan edged lower to around 7.23 per dollar as investors digested the latest monetary policy decision from the People's Bank of China.

2025/3/20 6:47,Рубль определяется с направлением после сильнейшего падения текущего года,"МОСКВА, 20 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль в четверг утром
определяется с направлением на внешних площадках после
сильнейшего падения с конца прошлого года, спровоцированного
закрытием накануне спекулятивных длинных рублевых позиций по
итогам не ставших прорывными переговоров глав США и России, а
также локальным спросом на значительно подешевевшую в предыдущие
дни инвалюту.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 9.35 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 83,50, и рубль набирает 0,6% от уровней закрытия среды, по
итогам которой он подешевел против доллара на 2,75%, впервые с
31 декабря прошлого года.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется по 91,58, что совпадает
с закрытием среды, по итогам которой российская валюта
подешевела против европейской на 2,4%, показав такую динамику
также впервые с 31 декабря. 
    Торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра""
завершились в среду на уровне 11,50 рубля за юань - российская
валюта в среду подешевела против китайской на 2,5%, в течение
торгов достигнув 9-месячного пика, 11,13. Вчерашний итог
биржевой сессии стал для рубля худшим с 9 декабря прошлого года.
    Позавчера же рубль взлетел в преддверии телефонных
переговоров Дональда Трампа и Владимира Путина до отметок 81 за
доллар и 88,88 за евро на форексе, а также 11,13 за юань на
Мосбирже - максимальных значений российской валюты с июня
прошлого года.
    В итоге президенты США и РФ поговорили, обсудили конфликт в
Украине и, в частности, договорились об отказе Москвы и Киева от
ударов по энергетической инфраструктуре на 30 дней, однако Путин
обозначил ряд моментов, мешающих немедленному временному
прекращению огня, которое, как надеялся Трамп, стало бы первым
шагом к постоянному мирному соглашению. 
    Накануне же американский президент общался по телефону с
украинским, отметив позже, что его телефонные разговоры и с
Владимиром Путиным и с Владимиром Зеленским были очень хорошими.
    Геополитическая новостная повестка остается ключевым, но и
волатильным фактором влияния на курс рубля.
    Дополнительным источником волатильности на локальном рынке в
среду могла стать и предстоящая сегодня квартальная экспирация
валютных фьючерсов на Мосбирже, после которой ситуация на
спотовом валютном рынке может стать более спокойной.
    Локальной же поддержкой российской валюте в ближайшее дни
выступает фактор корпоративных налоговых выплат 28 марта, при
этом в текущем месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят и
окончательные расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе
уплачивают налог на дополнительный доход за четвертый квартал
почти на полтриллиона рублей, что может потребовать повышенных
продаж экспортной валютной выручки за рубли.
    На стороне рубля также выступает высокая ключевая ставка
ЦБР, охлаждающая внутренний потребительский спрос, что приводит
к сокращению импортных закупок. Согласно опросу Рейтер,
Центробанк в пятницу сохранит ее на уровне 21%.
    На внешнем контуре благоприятным фактором для российской
валюты выступает текущая слабость валюты США из-за опасений за
рост американской экономики с учетом напряженности в мировой
торговле. Такие опасения подтвердила накануне ФРС, снизивший по
итогам своего заседания прогноз экономического роста на этот год
с 2,1% до 1,7%. Федрезерв в среду сохранил свою долларовую
ставку в диапазоне 4,25-4,50% годовых, но предположил ее
снижение на полпроцента до конца текущего года.
    Сейчас индекс доллара <=USD> оценивается в 103,49 (+0,1%),
он котируется вблизи достигнутого позавчера пятимесячного
минимума 103,19.
    Пара евро/доллар <EUR=> утром четверга котируется в
небольшом минусе по $1,0893, позавчера дорожая $1,0954 впервые с
9 октября.

      PBOC keen to prevent sharp gains in yuan

      Market monitoring Sino-US trade developments 
    

  
       SHANGHAI, March 20 (Reuters) - The yuan eased against
the U.S. dollar on Thursday after China sets its official
midpoint rate at the weakest in two months, signalling
authorities are keen to prevent quick or sharp gains in the
currency against a declining greenback.
    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China set
the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed
to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1754 per dollar, its weakest level
since U.S. President Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20.
    The U.S. dollar <=USD> has been on the backfoot for weeks
hobbled by Trump's erratic tariff policies and soft economic
data. 
    That has helped the yuan pare losses sustained since his
election in November and provided the PBOC with some reprieve
from using the fixing to contain losses.
    The dollar index <.DXY> has dropped about 4% this month, but
the yuan has appreciated less than 1% against the dollar.
    The weaker fixing did not mean the PBOC has deviated from
its policy stance of preserving currency stability, especially
as Trump's review of trade partners' currency policies in early
April is coming up, said Ken Cheung, director of currency
strategy at Mizuho Securities.
    ""The US dollar decline and Fed's easing bias should provide
relief to the renminbi (yuan) market, giving the PBOC some
flexibility to dial back some yuan fixing support,"" he said. 
    The spot yuan <CNY=CFXS> opened at 7.2250 per dollar and was
last trading at 7.2363 as of 0402 GMT, 83 pips lower than the
previous late session close and 0.85% weaker than the midpoint.
    The dollar was steady on Thursday, hovering near a
five-month low, after the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark
overnight rate steady on Wednesday and indicated it was not in a
rush to cut rates even as uncertainty around U.S. tariffs
weighed.
    Meanwhile, China held benchmark lending rates steady for the
fifth straight month in March, matching market expectations.
    Traders said the recent movements in the yuan suggested it
is unlikely to strengthen beyond 7.22 per dollar without further
market news, particularly regarding developments in trade
negotiations between the world's two largest economies.    
    Global investment banks have raised their projections for
China's economic growth and eased bearish views on the yuan,
spurred by early signs of economic recovery, though concerns
over escalating trade disputes with the U.S. persist.
    The offshore yuan traded at 7.2391 yuan per dollar <CNH=>,
down about 0.12% in Asian trade.
    The dollar index <=USD>, which measures the greenback
against six currencies, stood flat at 103.38.

       路透上海3月20日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周四早盘高开逾百点后回吐涨幅，中间价下跌57点创两个月新低，和路透预测偏离近650点。交易员表示，虽然美元回到阶段低点附近，但人民币即期接近7.22附近时购汇盘偏多，近期该水平要被突破需要更多的利好。
    
    “现在人民币就是区间运行，下来有购汇盘，上去也有些结汇需求，”一外资行交易员称，关税压力已经很大，人民币继续升值显然不符合实际情况，何况4月之后美国可能进一步加码关税。
    
    
    汇丰银行最新观点认为，4月之后特朗普仍可能对华关税宣布更多的关税，这将加剧人民币的贬值压力。“尽管我们认为中国有自己的动机来保持人民币汇率的合理稳定，但中国可能在晚些时候适度调整人民币汇率，以减轻对出口商的影响。”
    
    马来亚银行认为，虽然美元指数跌势有放缓迹象，不过整体下行趋势仍未改变，目前也没有迹象表明会出现逆转。

    特朗普周三称，“4月2日是美国的解放日”。白宫本周稍早表示，特朗普仍打算4月2日启动对等关税。
    
    特朗普还表示，随着美国关税开始“过渡”到经济中，美联储最好降息。此前美联储维持利率不变。
        
    隔夜美联储一如预期维持利率不变，主席鲍威尔表示，特朗普政府征收高额进口关税等初步政策，似乎使美国经济转向增长放缓，而且通胀至少暂时升高。
    
    决策者仍预计美联储到今年年底将降息两次、每次25个基点，与12月的预测一致。美国利率期货市场亦预计美联储2025年将降息两次。在6月会议上恢复降息的可能性为62.1%，利率决定宣布前的预期为57%。
    
    
    全球汇市方面，美元周四走软，之前美联储暗示今年晚些时候可能降息，尽管美国关税的不确定性仍在；英镑创下四个月新高，稍后英国央行将宣布政策决定。[FRX/CN]

2025/3/20 3:07,China holds key lending rates steady amid trade uncertainty,"China holds key lending rates steady amid trade uncertaintyMar 19, 2025

China’s central bank kept its key lending rates unchanged on Thursday as policymakers balanced the need to support economic growth while maintaining currency stability amid rising trade tensions.

The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) left the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) at 3.1% and the five-year LPR at 3.6%, unchanged since an October cut of 25 basis points.

The decision followed the US Federal Reserve’s move to hold benchmark interest rates steady, though Fed officials signalled the possibility of half a percentage point in cuts through 2025.

The Federal Reserve maintained its benchmark interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range, in line with expectations. US stocks climbed on Wednesday after the decision.

The LPRs, which serve as benchmarks for corporate and household loans, are set monthly based on rates submitted by designated commercial lenders.

While the one-year LPR influences business and personal loans, the five-year rate is a key reference for mortgage rates.

China’s trade concerns

The PBOC has also maintained its seven-day reverse repo rate, the country’s main policy rate, at 1.5% since October, as it seeks to prevent excessive yuan depreciation.

The Chinese offshore yuan has recovered some ground since hitting a 16-month low in January but remains nearly 1.8% weaker since US President Donald Trump’s election victory in November.

Following the rate decision, the yuan remained steady at 7.2280 per US dollar, while the yield on China’s 10-year government bonds fell by more than two basis points to 1.932%.

Chinese authorities have pledged to increase monetary easing this year, including potential rate cuts “at an appropriate time,” to support an ambitious economic growth target of around 5%.

However, analysts suggest that any major policy measures from the PBOC will likely depend on Trump’s trade policy actions.

Impact of Trump tariffs on China’s economy

President Trump recently imposed new 20% tariffs on Chinese imports and has threatened further levies in early April.

The move adds pressure to China’s export sector, which has been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise slowing economy.

Beijing has responded with countermeasures, imposing tariffs of up to 15% on US agricultural exports and expanding restrictions on American businesses.

In February, China’s Finance Ministry also announced 15% tariffs on US coal and liquefied natural gas imports, along with 10% duties on crude oil, agricultural equipment, and certain vehicles.

China’s export growth slowed more than expected at the start of the year, while imports also declined, reflecting weak domestic demand and the ongoing strain of US trade restrictions.

PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng has emphasized the importance of keeping the yuan stable at a “reasonable and balanced level,” a stance that could be seen as a goodwill gesture ahead of potential trade negotiations with Washington.

    隔夜美联储维持利率不变并预计增长放缓，美元涨幅收窄，美债收益率下降，人民币则因关税重压仍面临一定的调整压力，预计短期监管层继续保持对中间价的过滤举措。
    
    上日人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>收报7.2363元，而中间价则为7.1697元。根据定价机制，今日中间价变动中，有666点下跌反映市场供求影响，另有39点下跌反映的是隔夜一篮子汇率基本保持不变所需要的点数；“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。

    路透测算的上日人民币兑美元中间价为7.233元，和外汇交易中心公布的实际值偏差633点。上日路透根据CFETS公布的中间价测算，人民币汇率CFETS指数、参考SDR（特别提款权）篮子指数和参考BIS(国际清算银行)篮子指数分别为98.42、92.72和104.75。

    上日(截至北京时间次日凌晨3点)人民币兑美元即期累计成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为477.76亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

2025/3/19 23:25,"BUZZ-Asia Day Ahead-Regional data, China LPR, Taiwan rates lead","March 20 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on
Wednesday, as expected. However, policymakers indicated they still anticipate
reducing borrowing costs by 50 basis points by the end of this year, amid
slowing economic growth and eventually a downturn in inflation. 
    Wall Street, commodities, and the U.S. dollar climbed, as Treasury yields
fell.
    A positive lead for Asian markets, though EM ETFs only edged 0.25% higher.
Japan enjoys the Vernal Equinox Day holiday. Australian jobs, a key factor for
Reserve Bank of Australia rate policy, China's monthly loan prime rate setting
and a rate decision in Taiwan lead the busy regional event schedule. The focus
will be on domestic markets in Asia unless there is news.
    China's one-year and five-year LPRs are expected to remain unchanged.
Taiwan's central bank is expected to leave rates at 2% by all 33 economists
polled amid uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and inflation.
    Dow +0.92%, S&P +1.07%, and Nasdaq +1.41% after the FOMC's dovish hold.
Treasury yields eased as the Fed still expects 50bp in cuts this year; 2yr -7bp
to 3.977%, 10yr -4bp 4.247% and 30yr -2bp to 4.554%.
    Oil firmed, Brent and WTI +0.45%, as U.S. fuel inventories eased. U.S.
copper +1.95% on higher tariff expectations. Gold hit an all-time high at
$3051.99, closing +0.4% after the Fed forecast 50pt in cuts this year.
    The U.S. dollar gave back early gains stemming from the Turkish lira's
tumble, to close up just 0.2% after the FOMC. EUR -0.35%, GBP flat, USD/JPY
-0.4% as yield spreads narrowed, USD/CNH +0.05%, AUD and NZD -0.05%, and USD/CAD
+0.25%.

2025/3/19 14:29,"BUZZ-FX options wrap - Lira contagion limited, Fed leads central bank risk","FX option implied volatility remains broadly heavy after
retracing the bulk of its early March gains. However, a massive
Turkish lira rout driven by local political headlines eventually
hit broader risk to boost the USD, JPY and CHF. 
    There was a significant reaction in the lira options market,
but only a limited and short-lived reaction in G10 FX options.
    Benchmark 1-month EUR/USD implied volatility traded 8.0-8.1
and the rest of the 1-12-month expiry term structure found
support which lasted the day. There was also an increase in
downside strike demand on Wednesday and the 1-month risk
reversal regained a small EUR put/USD call premium at 0.125. 
    USD/JPY 1-month implied volatility traded 10.0 from 9.85 but
later posted a new setback low at 9.75. This marks a notable
retreat from the March 10 peak at 12.4, with further downside
potential toward the mid-February pre-rally lows of 8.8. 1-month
risk reversals have fallen from 1.85 to 1.25 JPY calls over puts
since March 10. 
    The near term focus remains on central bank policy
announcements. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to follow
the Bank of Japan decision and leave rates on hold later on
Wednesday. However, overnight expiry implied volatility is
slightly higher, signalling an increased risk of realised
volatility to come from Fed chair Jerome Powell's press
conference. 
    Overnight options are also elevated for GBP and CHF related
pairings, with policy announcements due from the Swiss National
Bank and Bank of England on Thursday.

2025/3/19 14:23,"ОБОБЩЕНИЕ-Рубль осыпался после переговоров РФ-США, теряет по 3% к доллару и юаню","МОСКВА, 19 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль падает на торгах среды,
против него играет спрос на значительно подешевевшую за
последнее время иностранную валюту, а также значительный buy the
fact по итогам вчерашних переговоров глав США и РФ, не ставших
прорывными в части урегулирования российско-украинского
конфликта.
    Таким образом, курс рубля ожидаемо для многих участников
рынка корректируется после нескольких дней роста до
многомесячных максимумов, достигнутых накануне из-за надежд
инвесторов на скорое завершение боевых действий на Украине и
улучшение отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом, а также с
учетом фундаментальных и сезонных факторов.
    На внешнем контуре против российской валюты может выступать
внутридневной рост валюты американской <=USD> в преддверии
итогов заседания ФРС США (21.00 МСК)
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 17.10 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,55, и российская валюта
дешевеет по отношению к юаню на 3%.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> в системе LSEG котировалась к этому
же времени по 83,85, и рубль также дешевеет на 3%. 
    Пара доллар/рубль на внебиржевом российском валютном рынке к
17.10 МСК котировалась в диапазоне 83,00-84,10, согласно средним
данным российских поставщиков финансовых услуг.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> находится сейчас на форексе вблизи
отметки 91,76, и рубль теряет 2,6%.
    По мнению Натальи Мильчаковой из компании
Freedom Finance Global, валютные трейдеры начали фиксировать
прибыль в растущем рубле и продавать его на состоявшемся факте
переговоров президентов США и РФ, ""то есть когда ожидания от
события были уже отыграны"". 
    Во вторник рубль взлетел в преддверии телефонных переговоров
Дональда Трампа и Владимира Путина до отметок 81 за доллар и
88,88 за евро на форексе, а также 11,13 за юань на Мосбирже -
максимальных значений российской валюты с июня прошлого года.
    В итоге президенты США и РФ поговорили, обсудили конфликт в
Украине и, в частности, договорились об отказе Москвы и Киева от
ударов по энергетической инфраструктуре на 30 дней, однако Путин
обозначил ряд моментов, мешающих немедленному временному
прекращению огня, которое, как надеялся Трамп, стало бы первым
шагом к постоянному мирному соглашению. 
    Уже сегодня Кремль обвинил Киев в отсутствии взаимности в
вопросе паузы в ударах по энергетической инфраструктуре после
того, как Минобороны РФ сообщило о ночных ударах беспилотников с
украинской стороны по нефтебазе в станице Кавказская на Кубани.
    Геополитическая новостная повестка остается ключевым, хотя и
волатильным фактором влияния на курс рубля, при этом косвенный
положительный эффект от улучшения внешнеполитической обстановки
может отражаться и в росте притока иностранного капитала на
рынки РФ, в том числе, в рамках операций carry trade.
    Источником же волатильности на локальном рынке сейчас может
выступать фактор предстоящей завтра квартальной экспирации
валютных фьючерсов на Мосбирже, в преддверии чего бывают
существенные колебания спотовых котировок рубля в условиях
текущей низкой ликвидности.
    ""После экспирации квартальных фьючерсов характер торгов
может измениться"", - полагает Алексей Антонов из компании Алор
Брокер.
    Положительную роль в динамике рубля до конца следующей
недели будет играть продажа экспортной валютной выручки за рубли
под корпоративные налоговые выплаты 28 марта, при этом в текущем
месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят окончательные расчеты с
бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе уплачивают налог на
дополнительный доход за 4 квартал почти на полтриллиона рублей.
    На стороне рубля выступает высокая ключевая ставка ЦБР,
охлаждающая внутренний потребительский спрос, что приводит к
сокращению импортных закупок. Согласно опросу Рейтер, Центробанк
в пятницу сохранит ее на уровне 21%.
    В пользу рубля играют и валютные интервенции Центробанка,
ежедневно продающего китайские юани почти на 6 миллиардов
рублей, а на внешнем контуре - ослабление доллара США до
9-месячных минимумов <=USD>.

2025/3/19 12:51,"FOREX-Основные валюты отступают вслед за турецкой лирой, безопасный доллар идет вверх","ЛОНДОН, 19 мар (Рейтер) - Крупнейшие валюты отступают на
фоне укрепления доллара в среду: сообщение о том, что турецкие
власти задержали главного политического соперника действующего
президента страны Тайипа Эрдогана встревожили инвесторов и
толкнули лиру к рекордному минимуму.
    Индекс доллара к корзине из шести основных валют <=USD> к
14:37 МСК вырос на 0,27% до 103,58, а лира <TRY=> упала на 3,94%
до 38,13 за доллар. Ранее в ходе торгов просадка турецкой валюты
достигала 14,5% - рекордное однодневное падение.
    ""Для (валют) стран G10 это, как правило, не очень значимый
драйвер, но я думаю, что (сегодня) рынок обеспокоен тем, что
происходит в Турции"", - отметил Майкл Пфистер из Commerzbank. 
    ""Это приводит к снижению аппетита к риску. Евро ослаб, а все
активы-убежища одновременно пришли в движение"", - добавил
аналитик.
    Единая валюта <EUR=> просела на 0,34% до $1,0906, но всё еще
остается вблизи достигнутого накануне максимума пяти месяцев в
$1,0955 - инвесторы с оптимизмом восприняли одобрение
парламентом Германии реформы, которая открывает возможность
масштабных заимствований для поддержки роста крупнейшей
европейской экономики.
    Между тем, совет управляющих Банка Японии, как
ожидалось, единогласно проголосовал за сохранение краткосрочной
ставки на уровне 0,5%. Чиновники решили потратить больше времени
на оценку возможного влияния пошлин США на ориентированную на
экспорт японскую экономику.
    Иена <JPY=> подешевела на 0,38%? до 149,83.
    ""Решение оставить денежно-кредитную политику без изменений
само по себе не является сюрпризом, поэтому его влияние на
валютные котировки ограничено. Однако более раннее, чем обычно,
время заявления, похоже, заставило финансовые рынки
первоначально интерпретировать его как то, что Банк Японии (не
рассматривал) возможность повышения ставки"", - сказал Хирофуми
Судзуки из SMBC.

    Австралийский доллар <AUD=> подешевел на 0,42% до $0,6334?,
а его новозеландский коллега <NZD=> - на 0,5% до $0,5789?. 
    Фунт стерлингов <GBP=> опустился на 0,2% до $1,2974?, а
швейцарский франк <CHF=> - на 0,3% до 0,879?.
    Юань снизился на 0,11% до 7,2346. 
    В то же время выросли криптовалюты: биткоин <BTC=> поднялся
на 2,4% до $83.982,24, а эфириум <ETH=> - на 5,93% до $2.018,4.
    Между тем трейдеры ждут решения ФРС. Американский
центробанк, как ожидается, сохранит стоимость заимствований на
текущем уровне. При этом в центре внимания будут новые
экономические прогнозы регулятора.
    В настоящее время денежные рынки закладывают в позиции
снижение ставок ФРС до конца года почти на 60 базисных пунктов.

    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> находится сейчас на форексе вблизи
отметки 91,04, и рубль теряет 1,8%. На российском межбанке евро
сейчас котируется вблизи 91,50 рублей.
    По мнению Натальи Мильчаковой из компании
Freedom Finance Global, валютные трейдеры начали фиксировать
прибыль в растущем рубле и продавать его на состоявшемся факте
переговоров президентов США и РФ, ""то есть когда ожидания от
события были уже отыграны"". 
    Во вторник рубль взлетел в преддверии телефонных переговоров
Дональда Трампа и Владимира Путина до отметок 81 за доллар и
88,88 за евро на форексе, а также 11,13 за юань на Мосбирже -
максимальных значений российской валюты с июня прошлого года.
    В итоге президенты США и РФ поговорили, обсудили конфликт в
Украине и, в частности, договорились об отказе Москвы и Киева от
ударов по энергетической инфраструктуре на 30 дней, однако Путин
обозначил ряд моментов, мешающих немедленному временному
прекращению огня, которое, как надеялся Трамп, стало бы первым
шагом к постоянному мирному соглашению. 
    Уже сегодня Кремль обвинил Киев в отсутствии взаимности в
вопросе паузы в ударах по энергетической инфраструктуре после
того, как Минобороны РФ сообщило о ночных ударах беспилотников с
украинской стороны по нефтебазе в станице Кавказская на Кубани.
    Геополитическая новостная повестка остается ключевым, хотя и
волатильным фактором влияния на курс рубля.
    Дополнительным источником волатильности на локальном рынке
могут стать квартальные экспирации валютных фьючерсов на
Мосбирже в четверг, в преддверии которых бывают существенные
колебания спотовых котировок рубля в условиях текущей низкой
ликвидности.
    ""После экспирации квартальных фьючерсов характер торгов
может измениться"", - полагает Алексей Антонов из компании Алор
Брокер.
    Положительную же роль в динамике рубля до конца следующей
недели будет играть продажа экспортной валютной выручки за рубли
под корпоративные налоговые выплаты 28 марта, при этом в текущем
месяце сырьевые корпорации проводят окончательные расчеты с
бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе уплачивают налог на
дополнительный доход за 4 квартал почти на полтриллиона рублей.
    На стороне рубля также выступает высокая ключевая ставка
ЦБР, охлаждающая внутренний потребительский спрос, что приводит
к сокращению импортных закупок. Согласно опросу Рейтер,
Центробанк в пятницу сохранит ее на уровне 21%.
    В пользу рубля и валютные интервенции Центробанка, ежедневно
продающего китайские юани почти на 6 миллиардов рублей, а на
внешнем контуре - ослабление доллара США до 9-месячных минимумов
<=USD>.

сессии среды закрепился в минусе, и против него играет спрос на
сильно подешевевшую за последнее время иностранную валюту, а
также buy the fact по итогам вчерашних переговоров глав США и
РФ, не ставших прорывными в части урегулирования
российско-украинского конфликта.
    Тем не менее рубль остается недалеко от многомесячных
максимумов, достигнутых накануне из-за надежд инвесторов на
скорое завершение боевых действий на Украине и улучшение
отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом, а также с учетом
фундаментальных и сезонных факторов.

2025/3/19 8:37,"Юань отступает, в центре внимания - решение ФРС, комментарии Пауэлла","ШАНХАЙ, 19 мар (Рейтер) - Китайский юань опускается в
паре с долларом в среду: инвесторы ждут решения Федрезерва
позднее в течение дня в надежде получить лучшее представление о
перспективах американской экономики, валюты США и о их влиянии
на мировые рынки.
    ""Рынки будут внимательно следить за комментариями
председателя Джерома Пауэлла сегодня вечером"", - сказал трейдер
одного из китайских банков.
    Китайский юань выиграл от недавней слабости доллара,
просевшего почти на 4% с начала марта, оказавшись под давлением
постоянно меняющихся планов президента США Дональда Трампа по
поводу пошлин и опасений о рецессии в Соединенных Штатах.
    ""Столкнувшись с ослаблением доллара, центральный банк Китая
принял ту же стратегию, что и в последние годы: он удерживает
юань относительно стабильным по отношению к доллару"", - сказал
Ларри Ху из Macquarie.
    Спотовый юань в Китайской системе валютной торговли SFETS на
материковом рынке <CNY=CFXS> к 11:20 МСК снизился на 0,19% до?
7,2371?, а на офшорном рынке <CNH=> подешевел на 0,18% до 7,24. 
    Перед открытием сессии ЦБ Китая объявил срединный
фиксированный курс <CNY=PBOC> на уровне 7,1697 за доллар. При
этом значение оказалось на 633 pips (десятитысячных долей
процентного пункта) сильнее приведенного Рейтер прогноза
аналитиков.
    По словам валютных трейдеров и аналитиков, торговые
отношения Китая с Соединенными Штатами продолжают оставаться в
центре внимания инвесторов, оказывая давление на настроения.
    ""Ответные действия (Китая) пока была умеренными, поскольку
Пекин все еще стремится к переговорам в надежде достичь
очередного торгового соглашения"", - сказал Ху из Macquarie.

2025/3/19 6:32,Рубль определяется с направлением после переговоров США-РФ и в ожидании ФРС,"МОСКВА, 19 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль в среду утром показывает
смешанные изменения на внешних площадках после вчерашних
переговоров глав США и РФ, а также в ожидании итога заседания
ФРС, от которого может зависеть последующая динамика форекса.
    После открытия российского биржевого валютного рынка влияние
на котировки рубля будут также оказывать реальные денежные
потоки: продажа экспортной выручки, локальный спрос на
значительно подешевевшую иностранную валюту, валютные
интервенции Центробанка.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 9.20 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 82,20, и рубль теряет 0,6% от уровней закрытия вторника, по
итогам которого он подорожал против доллара на 2%, в течение
торгов отметившись на свежем максимуме с прошлого июня, 81,00.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется по 89,35, и рубль
набирает 0,1% от закрытия вторника, по итогам которого
российская валюта подорожала против европейской на 1,8%, по ходу
также отметившись на максимуме с июня, 88,88. 
    Вчерашние торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра""
завершились на уровне 11,22 рубля за юань - российская валюта во
вторник подорожала против китайской на 1,2%, в течение торгов
достигнув 9-месячного пика, 11,13.
    Поводом к походу рубля на многомесячные максимумы стали
надежды инвесторов на позитивный исход телефонных переговоров
глав РФ и США, а также набор фундаментальных и сезонных
факторов.
    В итоге Дональд Трамп и Владимир Путин пообщались между
собой, в ходе переговоров обсудили конфликт в Украине и, в
частности, договорились об отказе Москвы и Киева от ударов по
энергетической инфраструктуре на 30 дней. 
    Валютный рынок в целом воспринял итоги в позитивном ключе,
если судить по котировкам рубля, которые остались недалеко от
свежедостигнутых экстремумов.
    Геополитическая новостная повестка остается ключевым, хотя и
волатильным фактором влияния на курс рубля.
    Положительную роль до конца следующей недели будет играть
продажа экспортной валютной выручки за рубли под корпоративные
налоговые выплаты 28 марта, при этом в текущем месяце сырьевые
корпорации проводят окончательные расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый
год, в том числе уплачивают налог на дополнительный доход за 4
квартал почти на полтриллиона рублей.
    На стороне рубля также выступает высокая ключевая ставка,
охлаждающая внутренний потребительский спрос, что приводит к
сокращению покупок инвалюты импортерами. 
    При этом согласно опросу Рейтер, ЦБР на заседании 21 марта
сохранит ставку на уровне 21%.
    В пользу рубля сейчас и валютные интервенции Центробанка,
который в марте продает китайские юани почти на 6 миллиардов
рублей в день.
    На внешнем контуре благоприятным фактором для российской
валюты выступает текущая слабость валюты США из-за опасений за
рост американской экономики с учетом напряженности в мировой
торговле.
    Сейчас индекс доллара <=USD> оценивается в 103,40, что на
0,1% выше последних значений вторника, в течение которого индекс
снижался до 103,19 впервые с 16 октября прошлого года.
    Пара евро/доллар <EUR=> утром среды котируется в небольшом
минусе по $1,0930, накануне дорожая $1,0954 впервые с 9 октября.
    Нефть вернулась к снижению после тестирования накануне
двухнедельного максимума, сейчас баррель Brent <LCoc1>
оценивается в $70,21 (-0,5%). 
    Мировые рынки ждут итоги заседания ФРС (21.00 МСК) с
сопроводительным посланием, обновленными прогнозами и

2025/3/19 3:41,"China's yuan eases, Fed decision and Powell comments in focus","SHANGHAI, March 19 (Reuters) - China's yuan eased
against the dollar on Wednesday, with investors looking ahead to
the Federal Reserve's policy decision due later in the session
for more clues on the outlook for the U.S. economy, its currency
and the impact on global markets.
    Fed policymakers are widely expected to keep rates
unchanged, but market participants are anxious to get a clearer
picture of how U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policy would
affect rate projections in the world's largest economy.
    ""Markets will pay close attention to Chair Jerome Powell's
comments tonight,"" said a trader at a Chinese bank.
    The Chinese yuan has benefited from recent dollar weakness,
which has fallen nearly 4% for the month, pressured by Trump's
erratic tariff moves and on fears of a recession in the United
States.
    ""Facing the weaker dollar, the People's Bank of China (PBOC)
adopted the same strategy as it did in recent years: It has held
the yuan relatively steady against the dollar,"" said Larry Hu,
chief China economist at Macquarie.
    ""As a result, the yuan depreciated against a basket of
currencies.""
    By 0254 GMT, the onshore yuan <CNY=CFXS> was 0.1% lower at
7.2320 per dollar, while its offshore counterpart <CNH=D3>
traded at 7.2330.
    The yuan's value against its major trading partners
<.CFSCNYI> fell to a more than five-month low of 98.42 on
Wednesday, losing more than 3% year-to-date, according to
Reuters calculation based on official data.
    Meanwhile, the spot yuan has gained about 1% to the dollar
so far this year.
    Prior to the market opening, the PBOC set the midpoint rate
<CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed to trade in a 2%
band, at 7.1697 per dollar, and 633 pips firmer than a Reuters'
estimate <CNY=RTRS> of 7.2330.
    Developments in trade relations with the United States
continue to remain front and centre on investors' radar,
weighing on sentiment, currency traders and analysts said.
    The U.S. has slapped a range of tariffs on its trading
partners, including China.
    ""But the response (from China) so far has been measured, as
Beijing is still seeking negotiations that could hopefully lead
to another trade deal,"" Macquarie's Hu said.
    Markets are closely monitoring further developments in CK
Hutchison's <0001.HK> sale of most of its global $22.8 billion
ports business, including assets near the strategically
important Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock <BLK.N>, as
it could affect the bilateral relations, traders said.
    

    Key onshore vs offshore levels:

       路透上海3月19日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周三早盘低开百点后维持区间窄幅整理，半日波动不足40点，中间价则小升36点，和路透预测偏离仍在600点以上。交易员表示，美元偏弱对人民币的提振效果仍相对有限，且待晚间美联储利率决议及会后声明的指引。

    “关税这么高，人民币升值缺乏基础，看看鲍威尔怎么说，”一外资行交易员称，“人民币要升破200均线，要美元进一步下跌。”
    
    
    德国议会周二批准了大规模增加支出的计划，摆脱了数十年的财政保守主义，希望恢复经济增长并扩大军费开支，开启欧洲集体防御的新时代。
    
    美联储在北京时间周四凌晨的政策决定对投资者而言至关重要，市场将了解联储如何看待特朗普政策及其对美国经济影响，以及其如何转化为利率前景。
    
    此前特朗普频频打出关税牌，市场越来越担心全球关税战会拖累美国经济，并可能加剧价格压力，而联邦政府大规模裁员预计会导致失业率上升。利率期货交易员认为，美联储最有可能在6月恢复降息，年底前的降息空间大概在60点左右。
    
    FWDBONDS首席经济学家Christopher Rupkey表示，“今天的所有经济数据都与关税有关。美国经济正在快速失去动能，如果华盛顿不改变其众多对营商不友好的提议和举措，经济衰退可能会很快从风险变成现实。”

    而一名白宫官员稍早前表示，特朗普政府仍打算在4月2日实施对等关税，澄清了财政部长贝森特的评论，后者暗示各国可以在美国政府开始征收新的进口关税之前进行谈判。

    德国议会周二批准了大规模增加支出的计划，摆脱了数十年的财政保守主义，希望恢复经济增长并扩大军费开支，开启欧洲集体防御的新时代。
    
    市场普遍预计美联储将在本周的议息决议上维持利率不变，投资者将关注决策者对经济和利率的最新预测以及鲍威尔的发言，市场将从中寻找美联储是否对经济前景愈发担忧的进一步线索。
    
    特朗普频频打出关税牌，市场越来越担心全球关税战会拖累美国经济，并可能加剧价格压力，而联邦政府大规模裁员预计会导致失业率上升。利率期货交易员认为，美联储最有可能在6月恢复降息。
    
    FWDBONDS 首席经济学家Christopher Rupkey表示，“今天的所有经济数据都与关税有关。美国经济正在快速失去动能，如果华盛顿不改变其众多对营商不友好的提议和举措，经济衰退可能会很快从风险变成现实。”

    路透测算的上日人民币兑美元中间价为7.2364元，和外汇交易中心公布的实际值偏差631点。上日路透根据CFETS公布的中间价测算，人民币汇率CFETS指数、参考SDR（特别提款权）篮子指数和参考BIS(国际清算银行)篮子指数分别为98.53、92.79和104.8。

    上日(截至北京时间次日凌晨3点)人民币兑美元即期累计成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为466.61亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

2025/3/18 23:24,"BUZZ-Asia Day Ahead-Japan, Indonesia rate decisions/outlooks lead","March 19 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Tuesday
to U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal for a month-long halt to strikes
against energy infrastructure in Ukraine but stopped short of accepting a full
U.S.-backed 30-day ceasefire.
    Israel warned of more to come as airstrikes killed over 400 in Gaza after
two months of truce.
    Wall Street fell on Tuesday, Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar eased,
while commodities were mixed.
    A negative lead for Asia with EM ETFs -0.5%. The Bank of Japan and Bank
Indonesia will decide on rates, while Japanese machinery orders, trade, and
industrial output lead Wednesday's data. The focus will be on regional markets
and the central bank outlooks following their rate decisions.
    The BOJ is expected to hold rates at 0.5%, but leave the door open to rate
hikes this year. Sixty-one of 62 economists polled expect no change in rates
Wednesday.
    BI is likely to keep rates steady at 5.75% according to 19 of 31 economists
polled, though rate cuts are expected if the rupiah stabilizes. 
    Dow -0.62%, S&P -1.06%, and Nasdaq -1.71%, despite resilient data, as
uncertainty surrounding tariffs and Wednesday's FOMC decision weighed.
    Treasury yields slipped after a strong 20-year auction, 2yr -1bp to 4.044%,
10yr -2bp to 4.285%, and 30yr -1bp to 4.587%, as traders bet that Federal
Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will adopt a relatively dovish tone at the news
conference.
    Oil fell as Ukraine peace talks offset further Middle East instability,
Brent -0.95%, WTI -1.25%. U.S. copper +1.05% amid U.S. tariff speculation. Gold
+1.05% on resurgent Middle East tensions.
    The U.S. dollar <=USD> eased 0.15%, led by EUR +0.2% as Germany's parliament
approved plans for a massive spending surge. GBP +0.1%, USD/JPY +0.05%, USD/CNH

2025/3/18 14:33,"Рубль начал мандражировать на внутреннем рынке, набирая более 2% на форексе","МОСКВА, 18 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль под вечер волатильного
вторника растерял значительное преимущество на внутреннем
валютном рынке - его залихорадило из-за локального спроса на
сильно подешевевшую инвалюту и частичной фиксации прибыли в
длинных спекулятивных рублевых позициях, но при этом российская
валюта остается в значительном плюсе на внешнем рынке.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 17.10 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,37, и российская валюта
теряет 0,1%, ранее достигнув максимума с июня 2024 года, уровня
11,13 рубля за юань.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 17.10 МСК
котировалась по 81,75, и рубль набирает чуть более 2%, ранее
отправляя доллар на 81,00 впервые с прошлого июня. 
    Пара доллар/рубль на внебиржевом российском валютном рынке к
этому времени котировалась вблизи 82,10, но днем вплотную
подходила к уровню 80 рублей за доллар, согласно средним данным
российских поставщиков финансовых услуг.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется сейчас на форексе по
89,21, и рубль набирает 2,1%, ранее дорожая до 88,88 также
впервые с июня. 
    Поводом к внутридневному росту рубля на многомесячные
максимумы против ключевых валют стали надежды инвесторов на
позитивный исход сегодняшних телефонных переговоров глав РФ и
США, а также с учетом поддержки фундаментальных и сезонных
факторов. 
    Разговор президентов России и США состоится с 16.00 до 18.00
МСК, и лидеры будут говорить столько, сколько посчитают нужным,
сказал журналистам сегодня пресс-секретарь Кремля Дмитрий
Песков.
    Рубль может показать итоговую динамику сегодняшних
высоковолатильных торгов в зависимости от соответствия рыночным
ожиданиям результатов переговоров.
    Надежды на скорое завершение украинского конфликта, а также
ожидания улучшения отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом с
последующей возможностью ослабления американских рестрикций
против России оказывали основную поддержку рублю в текущем году
и вывели его в число лидеров мирового рынка.
    В ближайшие две недели к благоприятному для российской
валюты текущему внешнеполитическому фону может добавиться
локальная поддержка приближающихся налоговых выплат (28 марта),
под которые российские экспортеры обычно наращивают продажу
иностранной валюты за рубли. 
    В марте сырьевые корпорации проводят окончательные расчеты с
бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе, уплачивают налог на
дополнительный доход за 4 квартал почти на полтриллиона рублей,
согласно расчетам Рейтер.
    ""На курс явно влияет движение финансовых активов. Возможно,
экспортеры, видя укрепление рубля, начали активно продавать
валюту, чтобы не потерять еще больше при успехе мирных
переговоров"", - считает профессор ВШЭ Евгений Коган, отмечая
также, что и иностранные инвесторы могут пробовать заходить в
российские активы через финансовую инфраструктуру третьих стран.
    ""Помимо геополитики и налогового периода, на валютный рынок
сейчас влияние может оказывать еще и фактор приближающейся
экспирации квартальных фьючерсов (в четверг)"", - нашли еще одну
причину текущей динамики рубля аналитики банка Санкт-Петербург.
    На стороне рубля также выступает высокая ключевая ставка
ЦБР, охлаждающая внутренний потребительский спрос, что в том
числе приводит к сокращению покупок инвалюты импортерами. 
    При этом согласно опросу Рейтер, российский Центробанк на
заседании 21 марта сохранит ставку на уровне 21%, поскольку
инфляция пока недостаточно замедлилась.
    В пользу рубля сейчас и валютные интервенции Центробанка,
который в марте продает китайские юани почти на 6 миллиардов
рублей в день.
    На внешнем контуре благоприятными факторами для российской
валюты выступают восстановление нефтяных котировок <LCOc1> после
многодневной негативной динамики и текущая слабость валюты США
<=USD>, которая котируется вблизи пятимесячных минимумов.

2025/3/18 14:24,"BUZZ-FX options wrap - No FX breakout, BoJ risk, EUR barriers","March 18 (Reuters) - FX option implied volatility remains broadly heavy
since retracing its early March gains to new medium-term highs. Shorter dated
expiry options did meet mild demand on Tuesday as EUR/USD and GBP/USD reached
new cycle highs, but not enough to signal a rise in the threat of an imminent FX
break-out. 
    Benchmark 1-month expiry EUR/USD implied volatility tested 8.0 from 7.75 but
could not build on those gains as EUR/USD slipped back to the big 1.0900 expiry
level from a key technical resistance zone below 1.1000 option barriers. Recall
1-month rallied 7.8 to 9.2 in early March. One-month risk reversals remain close
to neutral since surrendering their gains to new 3-year highs for topside
strikes in early March. 
    USD/JPY implied volatility also languishes at setback lows - 1-month 10.1
from a 12.4 high in early March. Risk reversals have also significantly reduced
their downside over upside strike premiums during this period. Overnight expiry
included Wednesday's Bank of Japan policy decision from Tuesday, but the lack of
additional implied volatility for related options highlights the widely expected
lack of change to existing policy. 
    The recent implied volatility setbacks bring sub 1-month expiry AUD/USD
levels to a more attractive reward versus risk zone when compared with past
realised volatility measures.

       路透上海/北京3月18日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周二收升逾170点创逾四个
月新高，中间价跌45点暂时脱离逾四个月高点，较路透预测偏离扩至逾600点。交易员表示
，美元维持弱势，且中国债市持续调整下中美负利差收窄，人民币外部压力大幅缓解；短期
料延续区间波动，等待关键事件指引。
    
    他们并指出，目前7.22附近逢低购汇需求不减，另外市场也在关注4月美国“对等关税
”落地及中美元首何时通话；在关键风险事件释放之前，人民币升贬值动能均不强。
        
    “就是在区间里波动，最近人民币不是焦点，”一中资行交易员称。
    
    该交易员并指出，随着近期债市的持续调整，中美负利差显著收窄也减轻了人民币的贬
值压力；同时，考虑到关税对出口企业的冲击，汇价显著升值也并不可取，“目前的区间对
各方来说应该都比较舒服。”
    
    另一中资行交易员表示，美国经济放缓担忧对美元拖累比较明显，关注下本周美联储最
新的经济预测，“美元/人民币下方买盘不少的，短期还是区间的估计。”
        
    
    高盛最新观点认为，预计中国当局将通过其他措施来抵消关税的不利影响，今年晚些时
候若中美领导人会面，人民币甚至可能走强。将6-12个月的人民币汇率预测从之前的7.40上
调至7.35。
        
    美联储(FED)、日本央行和英国央行预计都将在本周的会议上维持利率不变，市场将继
续关注官员们的任何前瞻性指引。美联储也将公布新的经济预测，这将为联储官员如何看待
特朗普政府政策可能对经济产生的冲击提供最具体的证据。
    
    联邦基金利率期货交易员认为，美联储最有可能在6月份恢复降息。美联储决策者将在
本周更新他们的利率和经济预测。
    

    交易员们还在关注有关俄乌可能达成和平协议的讨论。特朗普表示，在美俄官员在莫斯
科举行积极会谈后，他计划于周二与俄罗斯总统普京通话，讨论结束乌克兰战争的问题。

2025/3/18 8:15,"Доллар вблизи 81 р, евро дешевел до 89 р, юань до 11,15 р впервые с июн 24г","МОСКВА, 18 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль во вторник продолжает
активно набирать вес из-за надежд на скорое достижение
российско-украинского перемирия, а также нормализацию отношений
Вашингтона и Москвы после запланированных на сегодня телефонных
переговоров глав США и РФ.
    Поддержкой также сейчас выступают фундаментальные и сезонные
факторы, что вкупе с геополитическим оптимизмом подталкивает
рубль на обновление многомесячных максимумов.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 10.55 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,21, и российская валюта
набирает 1,3%, ранее достигнув свежего максимума с июня 2024
года, уровня 11,15 рубля за юань.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 10.55 МСК
котировалась по 81,40, и рубль дорожает на 2,5%. Текущее
значение - максимальное для рубля с прошлого июня. 
    Пара доллар/рубль на внебиржевом российском валютном рынке к
этому времени котировалась по 81,10.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется сейчас на форексе по
89,05, и рубль набирает на 2,3%, ранее достигнув значения 89,00
также впервые с июня. На российском межбанке евро сейчас
котируется вблизи 89 рублей.
    ""Накануне Трамп сделал еще несколько оптимистичных заявлений
в отношении перспектив урегулирования украинского конфликта, а
теперь осталось дождаться реакции российской стороны на
предложения по достижению мирного соглашения"", - отметила Елена
Кожухова из компании Велес Капитал. 
    Президент США Дональд Трамп подтвердил намерения провести во
вторник телефонные переговоры с российским коллегой Владимиром
Путиным, при этом глава Белого дома сообщил, что многие вопросы
окончательного соглашения по перемирию между Россией и Украиной
были согласованы.
    Надежды на скорое завершение украинского конфликта, а также
ожидания улучшения отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом с
последующей возможностью ослабления американских рестрикций
против России оказывали основную поддержку рублю в текущем году
и вывели его в число лидеров мирового рынка.
    В ближайшие две недели к благоприятному для российской
валюты текущему внешнеполитическому фону может добавиться
локальная поддержка приближающихся налоговых выплат, под которые
российские экспортеры обычно наращивают продажу иностранной
валюты за рубли.
    ""Помимо геополитики и налогового периода, на валютный рынок
сейчас влияние может оказывать еще и фактор приближающейся
экспирации квартальных фьючерсов (в четверг)"", - нашли еще одну
причину текущей динамики рубля аналитики банка Санкт-Петербург.
    На стороне рубля также выступает высокая ключевая ставка
ЦБР, охлаждающая внутренний потребительский спрос, что в том
числе приводит к сокращению покупок инвалюты импортерами. 
    При этом согласно опросу Рейтер, российский Центробанк на
заседании 21 марта ставку на уровне 21%, поскольку инфляция пока
недостаточно замедлилась.
    В пользу рубля сейчас и валютные интервенции Центробанка,
который в марте продает китайские юани почти на 6 миллиардов
рублей в день.
    На внешнем контуре благоприятными факторами ля российской
валюты выступают восстановление нефтяных котировок <LCOc1> и
текущая слабость валюты США <=USD>.

    目前市场定价暗示美联储在今年余下时间将降息约60个基点，降息次数略高于两次。
    
    华泰证券观点认为，本轮中国债市调整剧烈，但1.9%左右的10年期国债已经基本完成了对之前极致预期的修正，债市的需求力量并没有彻底消失，宏观逻辑还有反复可能，外需风险还未兑现；不过如果短期赎回引发超调，可能触及2.0%-2.1%的顶点。
    
    另外，市场还在关注有关俄乌可能达成和平协议的讨论。特朗普表示，在美俄官员在莫斯科举行积极会谈后，他计划于周二与俄罗斯总统普京通话，讨论结束乌克兰战争的问题。

    根据利率平价模型，多数情况下美元/人民币掉期点与中美利差正相关，即当中美利差扩大时，美元/人民币掉期点相应上涨，反之亦然；其中一年期掉期走势是美元/人民币掉期市场的重要标杆。（完）

2025/3/18 7:46,"Юань в небольшом минусе, в фокусе - статданные, торговая война","ШАНХАЙ, 18 мар (Рейтер) - Китайский юань слегка слабеет
во вторник, ранее в ходе сессии стабилизировавшись благодаря
обнадеживающим экономическим данным и мерам поддержки
потребления.
    По словам валютных трейдеров, беспокойство по поводу
возможной эскалации торговой войны с Соединенными Штатами
продолжало давить на настроения, и участники рынка
воздерживались от крупных ставок на рост юаня.
    ""Пока Китай не предпринимает решительных ответных действий,
юань видится относительно стабильным"", - говорится в записке
аналитиков Maybank.
    Спотовый юань в Китайской системе валютной торговли SFETS на
материковом рынке <CNY=CFXS> к 09:37 МСК снизился на 0,14% до
7,2341?, а на офшорном рынке <CNH=> - подешевел на 0,13% до
7,2345.
    Перед открытием сессии ЦБ Китая объявил срединный
фиксированный курс <CNY=PBOC> на уровне 7,1733 за доллар. При
этом значение оказалось на 631 pips (десятитысячных долей
процентного пункта) сильнее приведенного Рейтер прогноза
аналитиков.
    Аналитики Goldman Sachs пересмотрели вверх свои прогнозы
роста китайской валюты: теперь они ожидают юань на уровне 7,35
за доллар на горизонте шести и двенадцати месяцев, вместо 7,4.
Однако трехмесячный прогноз остался неизменным на уровне 7,3.
    Между тем официальные данные показали, что в феврале
коммерческие банки продали своим клиентам чистые $10,4
миллиарда, что указывает на сохраняющееся нежелание компаний
рассчитываться в иностранной валюте.

2025/3/18 6:58,Доллар подешевел до 82 р на форексе в преддверии переговоров глав США и РФ,"МОСКВА, 18 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль во вторник утром
продолжает укрепляться после значительного роста накануне, а
основной поддержкой по-прежнему остаются надежды на сегодняшние
переговоры президентов РФ и США, по итогам которых может
решиться судьба продвигаемого Вашингтоном перемирия в
российско-украинском конфликте, а также прояснятся перспективы
нормализации отношений Кремля и Белого дома.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 9.40 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 82,10, и рубль набирает 1,6% от уровней закрытия
понедельника, по итогам которого он подорожал против доллара на
2,4%. Ранее сегодня была достигнута отметка 82 рубля за доллар
впервые с прошлого июня.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется по 91,02, и рубль
набирает 0,1% от закрытия понедельника, по итогам которого
российская валюта подорожала против европейской на 2%. 
    Вчерашние торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра""
завершились на уровне 11,35 рубля за юань - российская валюта в
понедельник подорожала против китайской на 3,8% при объеме
сделок в 115 миллиардов рублей, в течение торгов отметившись на
максимуме с прошлого июня, 11,32.
    ""Технически пара юань/рубль пробила поддержку 11,6C11,7  и
теперь можно ждать движения в район чуть ниже 11"", - полагает
Алексей Антонов из компании Алор Брокер.
    Центробанк с учетом совершавшихся вчера на российских
биржевом и внебиржевом рынках сделок установил официальные
курсы: 11,60 рубля за юань, 84,31 за доллар и 90,84 за евро.
Текущие рублевые уровни - самыми низкие для этих валют с лета 
2024 года.
    Президент США Дональд Трамп подтвердил намерения провести во
вторник телефонные переговоры с российским коллегой Владимиром
Путиным, при этом глава Белого дома сообщил, что многие вопросы
окончательного соглашения по перемирию между Россией и Украиной
были согласованы.
    Надежды на скорое завершение украинского конфликта, а также
ожидания улучшения отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом с
последующей возможностью ослабления американских рестрикций
против России оказывали основную поддержку рублю в текущем году
и вывели его в число лидеров мирового рынка.
    Доллар против рубля потерял с начала года на форексе 27%,
евро - 22%, юань дешевеет в биржевой паре с рублем за этот же
период на 17%.
    На стороне рубля сейчас также выступает высокая ключевая
ставка ЦБР, охлаждающая внутренний потребительский спрос, что в
том числе приводит к сокращению покупок инвалюты импортерами. 
    При этом согласно опросу Рейтер, российский Центробанк на
заседании 21 марта ставку на уровне 21%, поскольку инфляция пока
недостаточно замедлилась.
    В пользу рубля сейчас и валютные интервенции Центробанка,
который в марте продает китайские юани почти на 6 миллиардов
рублей в день.
    В ближайшие же две недели к благоприятному для российской
валюты внешнему фону и фундаментальным факторам может добавиться
локальная поддержка приближающихся налоговых выплат, под которые
российские экспортеры обычно наращивают продажу иностранной
валюты за рубли.
    В пользу рубля сейчас и текущая динамика нефтяного рынка,
который восстанавливается с недавних многолетних минимумов. 
    Сейчас баррель североморской смеси Brent <LCOc1> котируется
по $71,45 (+0,7%), вблизи от достигнутого накануне
двухнедельного пика, $71,80.
    В противостоянии с долларом рублю помогает и слабость
американской валюты на внешних рынках из-за опасений за рост
экономики США с учетом напряженности в мировой торговле. Индекс
доллара котируется вблизи многомесячных минимумов, сейчас он
оценивается в 103,58 <=USD>.

       路透上海3月18日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周二早盘高开后回吐多数涨幅；中间价跌45点暂时脱离逾四个月高点，较路透预测偏离扩至逾600点。交易员表示，隔夜美元调整助力缓和人民币的外部压力，但7.22附近逢低购汇需求不减，若无外部进一步指引，人民币短期料延续区间走势。
    
    “美国经济放缓担忧对美元拖累比较明显，看看这周美联储最新的经济预测，”一中资行交易员称，“美元/人民币下方买盘不少的，短期还是区间的估计。”
    
    
    高盛最新观点认为，尽管中国遭遇两次10%的关税加征，但人民币中间价保持平稳，即期汇率还小幅升值，预计中国当局将通过其他措施来抵消关税的不利影响，今年晚些时候若中美领导人会面，人民币甚至可能走强。将6-12个月的人民币汇率预测从之前的7.40上调至7.35。
    
    瑞银大中华区首席经济学家汪涛最新报告指出，考虑到来自国内及国外的经济增长压力，预计中国政府可能需要在年内进一步加码政策支持，以实现增长目标。
    
    法兴银行则指出，考虑到美国例外论的消退，做多美元/CNH的吸引力已经减弱，不过中国的财政和货币政策刺激仍无法超越欧洲，由此可以考虑做多欧元/CNH。

    美联储(FED)、日本央行和英国央行预计都将在本周的会议上维持利率不变，市场将继续关注官员们的任何前瞻性指引。美联储也将公布新的经济预测，这将为联储官员如何看待特朗普政府政策可能对经济产生的冲击提供最具体的证据。
    
    联邦基金利率期货交易员认为，美联储最有可能在6月份恢复降息。美联储决策者将在本周更新他们的利率和经济预测。
    

    交易员们还在关注有关俄乌可能达成和平协议的讨论。特朗普表示，在美俄官员在莫斯科举行积极会谈后，他计划于周二与俄罗斯总统普京通话，讨论结束乌克兰战争的问题。

2025/3/18 0:20,路透测算的人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>今日料开在7.2364元附近,"路透上海3月18日 - 路透根据中国外汇交易中心(CFETS)公布的人民币汇率形成机制测算，人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周二预计会开在7.2364元附近，较上日贬值约676点。
    
    特朗普的政策可能冲击美国经济的担忧再度拖累美元表现，而德国达成财政协议也提振欧元人气，美元隔夜回调也部分助缓人民币的外部压力，不过目前人民币即期市场价和中间价仍存一定偏离，监管层料延续对单边预期的过滤，等待中间价恢复弹性的时机。

    上日人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>收报7.2388元，而中间价则为7.1688元。根据定价机制，今日中间价变动中，有700点下跌反映市场供求影响，另有24点上涨反映的是隔夜一篮子汇率基本保持不变所需要的点数；“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。

    路透测算的上日人民币兑美元中间价为7.2199元，和外汇交易中心公布的实际值偏差511点。上日路透根据CFETS公布的中间价测算，人民币汇率CFETS指数、参考SDR（特别提款权）篮子指数和参考BIS(国际清算银行)篮子指数分别为98.82、92.9和105。

    上日(截至北京时间次日凌晨3点)人民币兑美元即期累计成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为491.21亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

EUR +0.35% amid optimism into Tuesday's vote on German stimulus. GBP +0.4%,

2025/3/17 14:51,BUZZ-FX options wrap - Key FX volatility risks are being ignored,"FX option pricing is reflective of a range-bound spot market that isn't
expecting much in the way of renewed volatility or directional moves. That's
despite a plethora of central bank policy announcements and data risks this
week.
    Implied volatility gauges those risks as part of an FX option premium. It
reached new highs for 2025 in the bulk of G10 currency pairs in late
February/early March as the USD fell, and EUR and JPY rose. However, it's been
surrendering those gains over the last week as those FX moves peaked and
consolidation ensued. Sub 3-month expiry implied volatility has fully retraced
the bulk of the March gains, while longer dated expiries aren't far behind. 
    Benchmark 1-month expiry EUR/USD implied volatility has fully reversed its
7.7-9.2 gains, and risk reversals have reverted to a neutral premium in the
1-month expiry contract. That's after they spiked from a downside strike premium
to the highest topside strike premium since 2022 in early March. However, while
profits were booked after the significant spot and option price rally, traders
have left many 3-6 month expiry EUR calls with triggers at 1.1500 in play for
now.

2025/3/17 14:50,"Рубль набирает 3% к юаню на МОЕХ, доллар на рынках стоит дешевле 84 р","МОСКВА, 17 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль значительно вырос на
торгах понедельника в ожидании шагов к российско-украинскому
перемирию и нормализации отношений Вашингтона и Москвы по итогам
анонсированных на вторник переговоров президентов РФ и США.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 17.30 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,44, и российская валюта
набирает 3%, ранее достигнув свежего максимума с июня 2024 года,
уровня 11,41 рубля за юань.
    Пара доллар/рубль на внебиржевом российском валютном рынке к
этому времени котировалась по 83,20, при этом участники рынка
отмечают, что курс доллара сегодня опускался ниже 83 рублей. В
системе LSEG <RUB=> пара доллар/рубль котируется по 83,75, и
рубль набирает 2%, находясь также вблизи достигнутых на прошлой
неделе максимумов с прошлого июня.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 91,35, и
рубль набирает 1,8%. На российском межбанке евро дешевле 91,00.
    ""Исходя из сохранения повышенного влияния геополитики на
настроения внутреннего валютного рынка, рубль скорее останется
сильным"", - считает Владимир Евстифеев из банка Зенит,
предупреждая о рисках повышенной волатильности из-за
противоречивости поступающих новостей.
    Рубль показывает позитивную динамику в надежде на шансы
завершения украинского конфликта, а также в ожидании улучшения
отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом с последующей возможностью
ослабления американских рестрикций против России. 
    Сигналы о готовности к перемирию, хотя и с нюансами, на
прошлой неделе поступали как из Киева, так и из Москвы, при
посредничестве Вашингтона.
    Наталья Мильчакова из компании Freedom Finance Global
полагает, что помимо позитивного геополитического фона,
участники валютного рынка в качестве потенциальных драйверов
укрепления рубля к доллару могут рассматривать некоторую
вероятность смягчения риторики ФРС по итогам заседания 18C19
марта на фоне неожиданного замедления инфляции в США в феврале,
а также возможные комментарии Банка России по итогам его совета
директоров 21 марта. 
    ""Если сопроводительные комментарии (российского) регулятора
будут содержать намеки на смягчение ДКП, заключающееся в
обозримой перспективе, это поддержит рубль, тем более что
инвесторы рассчитывают на стимулирующий эффект снижения ставки
для экономического роста в РФ"", - уверена Мильчакова.
    В ближайшие две недели к формально в целом благоприятному
для российской валюты внешнему фону может добавиться локальный
фактор приближающихся налоговых выплат, под которые российские
экспортеры обычно наращивают продажу иностранной валюты за
рубли.
    Согласно расчетам Рейтер, суммарный объем февральского
нефтяного НДПИ, входящего в проводимый 28 марта Единый налоговый
платеж, составит 690 миллиардов рублей против 868 миллиардов
месяцем ранее. 
    Это хотя и чревато снижением продаж экспортной валютной
выручки под уплату нефтяниками данного налога, однако оно с
лихвой может компенсироваться реализацией инвалюты сырьевыми
корпорациями под окончательные расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый
год, в том числе, по налогу на прибыль. 
    ""На март приходится уплата годовых налогов, и экспортеры
могут заранее нарастить продажи валютной выручки. На этом фоне
курс (юаня) по итогам недели может остаться ниже 12 рублей"", -
полагают аналитики банка Санкт-Петербург.
    На стороне российской валюты остаются также продажи
китайской валюты Центробанком, сейчас почти на шесть миллиардов
рублей в день.
    Добавляет оптимизма рублю и текущая динамика нефтяного
рынка, где котировки сегодня достигли двухнедельных максимумов
после обещания США продолжать атаки на йеменских хуситов, что
таит риски для поставок ближневосточного сырья.
    Сейчас баррель Brent <LCOc1> котируется по $71,20 (+0,9%), а
утром он дорожал до отметки $71,80 впервые с 3 марта.

2025/3/17 13:18,"China Underwhelms, PBOC sets Dollar Fix Lower, Bessent's Lack of Concern Weighs on US Stocks, and More US Tariffs Coming","China Underwhelms, PBOC sets Dollar Fix Lower, Bessent's Lack of Concern Weighs on US Stocks, and More US Tariffs ComingMar 17, 2025

Overview:The US dollar begins the new week quietly. The week features four G10 central bank meetings, and real sector data that may show the US economy is resilient despite the Atlanta's Fed's pessimism (which will be updated today). President Trump renewed his warning that reciprocal and sectoral tariffs will be announced on April 2. The greenback is trading with a mostly softer but consolidative bias today. Emerging market currencies are mixed, but of note the PBOC set the dollar's reference rate sharply lower (0.07%), the most this year, and at its lowest level in four months. The official announcement of new efforts to boost consumption, which helped fuel the rally in consumer stocks before the weekend seemed to lack the details necessary to capture investors' imaginations.?

US Treasury Secretary Bessent's dismissal of the sharp drop in US equities as a ""healthy correction"" ironically encouraging more sales. US index futures are off by about 0.5% to pare the strong pre-weekend advance. Asia Pacific equities rallied. China's CSI 300 was a notable exception, though Shanghai and Shenzhen eked out a small gain and mainland shares in HK advanced almost 0.6%. The Stoxx 600 in Europe is almost 0.5% higher, its third advance in the past four sessions. Benchmark 10-year yields are 5-7 bp lower in Europe today. There is some nervousness ahead of tomorrow's spending vote in Germany tomorrow. The French premium over Germany is a little smaller after Fitch confirmed France's sovereign rating at AA- and retained a negative outlook. Greek bonds are also off seven basis points after Moody's joined the other major rating agencies to give Greece investment grade status again. Gold is firm though slightly under the record-high set before the weekend near $3005. April WTI is firmer and traded above $68 for the first time since March 4, encouraged by the heightened risks of disruption following the US strike on the Houthis and Yemen.?

USD:The Dollar Index consolidated before the weekend ad continues today. The downside momentum stalled in the first part of last week, slightly below 103.25. It has been greeted with fresh sellers on attempts above 104.00 in the last two sessions and remains below it today. Real sector data this week and the Federal Reserve's assessment may help ease fears about the magnitude of the economic slowdown The Atlanta Fed's GDP tracker has spooked some participants with its -2.4% projection. It will be updated today and so far, has been based primarily on January data. Today's February retail sales report will be a step in the right direction. The headline is expected to rise by around 0.7% after falling by 0.9% in January. Some of the surge in imports (drag on GDP) will find their way into inventories (good for GDP). Tomorrow, February housing starts (residential investment) are expected to have bounced back after the partly weather-induced nearly 10% drop in January, and industrial output is seen expanding by 0.3% and growing by 0.5% in January.?

EURO:Encouraged by reports suggesting an agreement has been struck between the CDU/CSU, SPD, and Greens in Germany to allow passage of its new fiscal initiative in the this week, the euro set session highs ahead of the weekend slightly above $1.0910. Last week's high was closer to $1.0950. Support was found near $1.0865. The euro did not trade below $1.08 last week. It is trading quietly today between about $1.0870 and $1.0905. With the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, Sweden's Riksbank, the Swiss National Bank and Bank of England meetings, and a light economic diary, the eurozone is out of spotlight a bit this week. Many participants will be monitoring negotiations in Germany on the fiscal front and as the new government is forged.?

CNY:The dollar slipped against the offshore yuan last week and has risen in only one week since the end of January. The greenback made a marginal new low for the year last week against the onshore and offshore variants. It is on the weaker side of its four-month trading range. We suspect the risk-reward favors a firmer US dollar rather than a downside break (below CNH7.20). The PBOC set the dollar's reference rate at CNY7.1688 (CNY7.1738 before the weekend). It is the biggest change in the fix this year and the lowest reference rate for dollar since shortly after the US election last November. The weaker dollar setting lowers the top of the 2% band in which it is allowed to move. This is China provided February real sector data before the markets opened. They are difficult to read in the sense, there were not January releases, and the timing of the lunar new year holiday is also a source of distortion. On a year-over-year, year-to-date basis both industrial production and retail sales are running below last year's pace. New house prices slipped 0.14%, the first quickening of the decline since last August. Existing house prices fell by 0.34%, which is about the pace seen for the past few months. More economic support is likely needed to ensure growth and inflation targets are met. Officials unveiled sketch of a plan to boost consumption, births, and AI investment.?

JPY:The dollar recorded five-month lows last Tuesday near JPY146.55 and posted its highest settlement in seven sessions ahead of the weekend near JPY148.50. It is trading little changed? on the day in Europe near JPY148.65, having probed JPY149 earlier. Rising US rates and falling Japanese rates was the proximate driver of the dollar's gains before the weekend, which at around 0.40%, was the biggest single day advance in two weeks. The JPY149.20-30 area offers nearby resistance, but a close above JPY150 is needed to boost confidence the down trend from the January 10 high (~JPY158.85) is over. Tomorrow's January tertiary industry index is likely to confirm the weak start to year, while the February trade figures will likely improve after the JPY2.74 deficit in January. The trade balance always improves in February from January and front-running US tariffs may have flattered exports. The highlight of the week is the BOJ meeting that ends Wednesday. A March 4-11 Reuters poll found all but one of the 62 economists expect not change at this week's meeting and about 2/3 expect the next hike in Q3, probably July.?

GBP:Sterling softened a bit ahead of the weekend, but given the unexpected contraction in January's GDP, its resilience stood out. After pushing above $1.29 last Tuesday, sterling has remained above it. It barely slipped through the previous day's low before the weekend but held above last Wednesday's low (~$1.2915). It is trading firmly near the pre-weekend high (~$1.960). During sterling's recovery from the January 13 low near $1.21, counter-trend pullbacks, for which there have been four by our reckoning, they averaged almost two cents, but the was one outlier. Three such moves averaged about 1.6-cents, which would suggest potential toward around $1.2860, last week's low. The UK economic calendar is light until Thursday's employment data and Bank of England meeting. Like with the Fed and BOJ, there is practically no chance of a change in the BOE's policy this week. Indeed, Governor Bailey may note that the high level of uncertainty lends itself to a cautious stance. The base rate is at 4.50%. The swaps market has it a little below 4% at the end of the year. At the end of 2024, the swaps market put it near 4.10% and in early February, it was near 3.80%.?

CAD:The policy uncertainty sapping the conviction of businesses and traders stems from the US on-again-off-again tariff and threats, which given the integration of the US-Canadian economies for more than a generation, is a shock of great significance. There is also uncertainty arising from the intent of the new prime minister Mark Carney. The US dollar spent the last two sessions within the range set last Wednesday (~CAD1.4355-CAD1.4485). The range for the month was set in the first week of March (CAD1.4240-CAD1.4545). Only a break of this wider range is notable. The US dollar is pinned near last week’s lows and has not been above CAD!.4385 today. It found support in the second half of last week a little above CAD1.4350. Canada begins the week with February housing starts, existing home sales, and January's portfolio flow report. In terms of data, tomorrow's February CPI report is more important. However, attention in on the two political stories. One is the US instigated trade war. Canada, like the EU, have announced retaliatory measures, the UK, Mexico, and Australia, for example, have not. Second, Canada's parliament is due to return March 24. If Carney is to call for an early election, it would seem likely before then. It would likely be held in late April or early May.?

AUD:?The Australian dollar finished last week at the up end of week's range, above $0.6310. It reached a marginally new seven-day high near $0.6350 so far today. The intraday momentum is stretched. A break of $0.6320 may be the first sign of that a near-term top may be in place. Australia's economic diary is light until Thursday's February employment report. It created almost 110k jobs in Jan-Feb 2024. It would need to have created 66k last month to match that after a 44k increase in January. On the other hand, a disappointing report is unlikely to persuade the market that the central bank can cut rates when it meets next on April 1.?

MXN:Mexico's economic calendar is featureless until the first half of March CPI next Monday. The peso has not only been resilient to US tariff threats, but the peso also shrugged off news last week that industrial production fell by 0.4% in January, defying expectations for a small bounce after a 1.4% drop in December. It was the fourth consecutive monthly decline. Ideas that fentanyl confiscated at the southern US border could ease the US tariff threat helped lift the peso ahead of the weekend to its best level since shortly after the US election last November. The dollar traded below MXN19.85. It is consolidating in a narrow range so far today (~MXN19.91-MXN19.96). Barring a negative surprise with the CPI, the central bank is poised to deliver another 50 bp rate cut when it meets on March 27. Brazil's central bank has already pre-committed to a 100 bp hike of the Selic Rate to 14.25% this week. Last week's news that inflation (IPCA) jumped 1.3% in February for 5.06% year-over-year rate. That is the highest since September 2023. The dollar through BRL5.72 at the end of last week, its lowest level in about two-and-a-half weeks. The low this quarter recorded on February 18 near BRL5.6750. The 200-day moving average, which the dollar has not settled below since February 2024 is near BRL5.70 now.?

Путина и президента США Дональда Трампа.

настроения внутреннего валютного рынка, рубль скорее останется
сильным"", - считает Владимир Евстифеев из банка Зенит,
предупреждая, что возможна повышенная волатильность из-за
противоречивости поступающих новостей.
    Рубль показывает позитивную динамику в надежде на шансы
завершения украинского конфликта, а также в ожидании улучшения
отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом с последующей возможностью
ослабления американских рестрикций против России. 
    Сигналы о готовности к перемирию, хотя и с нюансами, на

    По мнению Дениса Попова из ПСБ, с учетом
умеренно-позитивного геополитического фона, роста нефти и

таких как слабость импорта в условиях жесткой ДКП, а также при
высокой активности экспортеров перед налогами возможно
обновление локальных минимумов по стоимости иностранных валют.

    На стороне российской валюты остаются также продажи
китайской валюты Центробанком, сейчас почти на шесть миллиардов
рублей в день.
    Добавляет оптимизма рублю и текущая динамика нефтяного
рынка, где котировки сегодня достигли двухнедельных максимумов
после обещания США продолжать атаки на йеменских хуситов, что
таит риски для поставок ближневосточного сырья.
    Сейчас баррель Brent <LCOc1> котируется по $71,13 (+0,8%), а
ранее он дорожал до отметки $71,80 впервые с 3 марта.
    По мнению Дениса Попова из ПСБ, с учетом
умеренно-позитивного геополитического фона, роста нефти и
сохранения фундаментальных факторов в пользу укрепления рубля,
таких как слабость импорта в условиях жесткой ДКП, а также при
высокой активности экспортеров перед налогами возможно
обновление локальных минимумов по стоимости иностранных валют.

 (新增评论及收盘报价)
       路透上海/北京3月17日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周一收跌百点；中间价则
升50点创逾四个月新高，这也是近两个月来最大上升点数，不过较路透预测仍偏离逾500点
。交易员称，市场主流叙事看似要回到美国通胀上，美指<.DXY>暂时企稳；而好于预期的中
国经济数据及刺激消费举措，也并未给人民币带来明显提振。
    
    市场人士并指出，由于前有20%的关税重压，而且后续中美贸易战还可能进一步升级，
近期人民币反弹明显较其他非美货币偏弱；估计在即期汇率在和中间价接近前，中间价大概
率以稳为主，而即期汇价要扩大反弹，更依赖外部美元走弱。
    
    “美元/人民币目前就在ma20和ma200区间波动，”一外资行交易员称，“欧元最近也有
点熄火，短期还是看区间震荡。”
    
    
    招商银行金融市场部观点认为，短期来看，美国对华关税的可信度较高，预计人民币将
维持高位震荡行情；中期需重点关注中美谈判以及双方的财政货币增量政策。
    中金公司外汇团队周度展望指出，本周市场需重点关注美、英、日的央行会议，若美联
储本周会议基调偏鹰，那么美元近期的下行趋势可能面临反弹风险。对人民币而言，近期人
民币汇率压力在近期持续减轻，不过关税仍是较大的不确定性来源。
    
    得益于一揽子存量和增量政策效应继续发挥，中国1-2月经济持续恢复，工业和投资同
比超预期增长，消费增速在春节效应和以旧换新政策加力扩围支持下升至三个月高点。国家
统计局形容前两个月经济“运行起步平稳、发展态势向新向好”。
    
   特朗普表示，他无意对钢铝关税给予豁免，并称将于4月2日征收对等关税和行业关税。
美国财长贝森特周日称，“不能保证”美国不会出现经济衰退。
    
    目前利率期货的定价仍反映出预期美联储将于6月开始降息，到年底前共降息三次的可
能性较大。但随着美国通胀预期上升，12月第三次降息的可能性有所下降。
    
    本周美联储政策会议料将利率维持在目前的4.25%-4.50%区间，交易商也押注美联储不
会在5月会议降息。投资者将关注本周美联储决策者发布的最新经济和利率预测，以寻找他
们是否变得更加担忧经济前景的迹象。
        
    全球汇市方面，美元兑主要货币周一徘徊在五个月低点附近，受特朗普反复无常的贸易
政策和一系列疲软的宏观经济数据的打压。欧元距离五个月高位不远，此前德国各政党周五

2025/3/17 7:12,RPT-BUZZ-FX options wrap - FX volatility risk hedges are looking attractive,"(Repeated from late Friday with no changes )
Implied volatility reflects market expectations of actual
volatility and plays a crucial role in option pricing. It has
pulled back significantly from recent and medium-term highs,
particularly in sub-three-month expiries, potentially presenting
an attractive risk-reward opportunity.
Of course, lower implied volatility is indicative of lower FX
realised volatility, so the setbacks are justified while FX spot
markets remain consolidative and risk appetite improved. 
USD/JPY implied volatility led the recent charge higher but
1-month expiry has already fully retraced the 2.0 surge to 12.4.
The 1-month expiry date includes a host of volatility risk
events including both central bank policy decisions, key US jobs
and inflation data and the 2 April reciprocal tariff deadline -
to highlight its potential value. 
EUR/USD was unable to sustain a retest of the 1.0900 handle
after a news report citing a potential German government deal on
the debt ceiling extension. Implied volatility is almost
unchanged after its setback from its recent test of Januaries
highs (1-month based 7.85 from 9.2).
However, sub 3-month EUR/USD risk reversals are retesting a
downside strike premium and there's been light demand for
outright downside strike via vanilla and EUR put trigger options
since mid-week. 
    Other G10 currency pairs have seen their implied
volatilities retrace lower over recent sessions before running
into light buying interest and potential value levels. 
    Plenty of FX option strikes expire next week [nL1N3PX0CY]

2025/3/17 6:54,"Рубль ждет переговоры глав США и РФ, будет надеяться на налоговую поддержку","МОСКВА, 17 мар (Рейтер) - Котировки рубля в начале
наступившей недели будут во многом отражать спекулятивные потоки
в ожидании анонсированных президентом США Дональдом Трампом
переговоров с его российским коллегой Владимиром Путиным во
вторник.
    Надежды на продвижение к российско-украинскому перемирию, а
также шаги по нормализации отношений Вашингтона и Москвы по
итогам этих предстоящих переговоров могут поддержать курс рубля
как на внешних рынках, так и локально.
    ""В поле"" же дополнительной поддержкой может стать
постепенное расширение реальных продаж иностранной валюты за
рубли российскими экспортерами под уплачиваемые в следующую
пятницу корпоративные налоги.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 9.40 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 85,85, и рубль теряет 0,4% от уровней закрытия пятницы, по
итогам которой он подорожал против доллара на 0,9%.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется вблизи отметки 93,02,
уровня закрытия пятницы, по итогам которой рубль окреп на 0,6%.
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 12,19, что вновь совпадает с последними предыдущими
показателями LSEG.
    Пятничные же торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами
""завтра"" завершились на уровне 11,80 рубля за юань - российская
валюта подорожала на четверть процента при объеме сделок в 97
миллиардов рублей, в течение сессии отметившись на максимуме
марта, 11,68.
        Рубль показывал в пятницу и почти всю прошлую неделю
позитивную динамику в надеждах на возможность завершения
украинского конфликта, а также в ожидании улучшения отношений
между Кремлем и Белым домом с последующей возможностью
ослабления американских рестрикций против России. 
    Сигналы о готовности к перемирию, хотя и с нюансами, на
прошлой неделе поступали как из Киева, так и из Москвы, при
посредничестве Вашингтона, в частности, спецпосланник президента
США Стив Уиткофф провел длительную встречу с президентом России
Владимиром Путиным, итоги которой были донесены до Дональда
Трампа. 
    К формально в целом благоприятному для российской валюты
внешнему фону в ближайшие дни может добавиться локальный фактор
приближающихся налоговых выплат. 
    Согласно расчетам Рейтер, суммарный объем февральского
нефтяного НДПИ, входящего в проводимый 28 марта Единый налоговый
платеж, составит 690 миллиардов рублей против 868 миллиардов
месяцем ранее. 
    Это хотя и чревато снижением продаж экспортной валютной
выручки под уплату нефтяниками данного налога, но оно может
компенсироваться реализацией инвалюты сырьевыми корпорациями под
окончательные расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе, по
налогу на прибыль. 
    На стороне российской валюты остаются также продажи
китайской валюты Центробанком, сейчас почти на шесть миллиардов
рублей в день.
    Тем временем, на мировых рынках нефть сегодня дорожала до
двухнедельных максимумов после обещания США продолжать атаки на
йеменских хуситов, что таит риски для поставок ближневосточного
сырья, но затем котировки откатились от пиковых значений на фоне
 неоднозначной китайской экономической статистики, отразившей
замедление промпроизводства.
    Сейчас баррель Brent <LCOc1> котируется по $71 (+0,6%), а
ранее он дорожал до отметки 71,80 впервые с 3 марта.
    На форексе индекс доллара показывает нулевую динамику и
оценивается в 103,73 <=USD>, пара евро/доллар минимально
подрастает и котируется по $1,0883 <EUR=>.
    Ключевым событием на текущей неделе для мировых рынков будет
заседание ФРС США, итого которого станут известны в среду
вечером. Рынки не ждут от регулятора изменения текущего уровня
долларовой ставки в 4,50% годовых, но надеются увидеть свежие
макропрогнозы и услышать намеки о возможных шагах Федрезерва при
волатильной внешнеэкономической политике Дональда Трампа.

2025/3/17 3:25,中国汇市：美指企稳人民币早盘高开低走，向好中国经济数据直接影响有限,"* 
      人民币早盘高开低走，中间价创逾四个月新高
    

        * 
      中间价实际值和路透预测偏离仍超500点
    

        * 
      中国经济数据整体好于预期，但对汇市提振有限
    

        * 
      人民币反弹更依赖美元走弱
    

  

       路透上海3月17日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周一早盘高开低走，盘中汇价短暂逼近7.24低点；中间价升50点创逾四个月新高，这也是近两个月来最大上升点数，不过较路透预测仍偏离逾500点。交易员表示，市场主流叙事看似要从欧洲回到美国通胀上，美指<.DXY>暂时企稳，而中国经济数据整体好于预期，不过数据并未给人民币带来明显提振。
    
    市场人士并指出，人民币反弹明显较主要非美货币偏弱，前有20%的关税重压，而且后续中美贸易战还可能进一步升级；估计在即期汇率在和中间价接近前，中间价大概率以稳为主，而即期汇价要扩大反弹，更依赖外部美元走弱。
    
    “美元/人民币目前就在ma20和ma200区间波动，”一外资行交易员称，“欧元最近也有点熄火，短期还是看区间震荡。”
    
    
    招商银行金融市场部最新观点认为，短期来看，美国对华关税的可信度较高，预计人民币将维持高位震荡行情。中期需重点关注中美谈判以及双方的财政货币增量政策。
    
    周日中国公布提振消费的方案，部署了八方面30项重点任务，包括促进工资性收入合理增长，研究建立育儿补贴制度，加大消费品以旧换新支持力度，多措并举稳住股市，以及持续用力推动房地产市场止跌回稳等。

    中金公司外汇团队最新周度展望指出，本周市场需重点关注美、英、日的央行会议，若美联储本周会议基调偏鹰，那么美元近期的下行趋势可能面临反弹风险。对人民币而言，近期人民币汇率压力在近期持续减轻，不过关税仍是较大的不确定性来源。
    
    特朗普上周表示，他不会改变4月2日起对所有贸易伙伴全面征收对等关税的想法。美国财长贝森特周日称，“不能保证”美国不会出现经济衰退。上周五美国公布的密西根大学调查显示，3月消费者信心大幅下滑，消费者认为未来五年的通胀率将达到3.9%，为30多年来的最高值。
    
    目前利率期货的定价仍反映出预期美联储将于6月开始降息，到年底前共降息三次的可能性较大。但随着美国通胀预期上升，12月第三次降息的可能性有所下降。
    
    
    本周美联储政策会议料将利率维持在目前的4.25%-4.50%区间，交易商也押注美联储不会在5月会议降息。投资者将关注本周美联储决策者发布的最新经济和利率预测，以寻找他们是否变得更加担忧经济前景的迹象。
        
    全球汇市方面，美元兑主要货币周一徘徊在五个月低点附近，受特朗普反复无常的贸易政策和一系列疲软的宏观经济数据的打压。而德国可能增加国防开支并重振该国经济增长的预期助力欧元保持偏强走势。[FRX/CN]
    
    北京时间11:03，人民币兑美元<CNY=CFXS>即期报7.2375元，上日收报7.2288元，夜盘终报7.2358元。今日人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>报7.1688元，创2024年11月8日以来新高，上日为7.1738元。截至目前人民币即期成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为158.05亿美元。

2025/3/17 0:24,路透测算的人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>今日料开在7.2199元附近,"路透上海3月17日 - 路透根据中国外汇交易中心(CFETS)公布的人民币汇率形成机制测算，人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周一预计会开在7.2199元附近，较上日贬值约461点。

    美国通胀数据助力美元缓和跌势，而德国增加国防开支也提振欧元人气，后续要看市场如何博弈；对人民币而言，即期市场价和中间价仍有一定偏离，监管层料继续对单边预期进行过滤。
    
    上日人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>收报7.2288元，而中间价则为7.1738元。根据定价机制，今日中间价变动中，有550点下跌反映市场供求影响，另有89点上涨反映的是隔夜一篮子汇率基本保持不变所需要的点数；“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。

    路透测算的上日人民币兑美元中间价为7.2463元，和外汇交易中心公布的实际值偏差725点。上日路透根据CFETS公布的中间价测算，人民币汇率CFETS指数、参考SDR（特别提款权）篮子指数和参考BIS(国际清算银行)篮子指数分别为98.81、92.82和104.98。

    上日(截至北京时间次日凌晨3点)人民币兑美元即期累计成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为540.54亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

This initiative builds on recent government pledges to support demand amid risks from Trump’s tariffs, with measures aimed at increasing household income, lifting spending, and encouraging a higher birth rate. Meanwhile, traders digested mixed economic data, including a 4% year-on-year rise in retail sales for the first two months of 2025, the fastest since October, and a stronger-than-expected 5.9% expansion in industrial production.

2025/3/16 23:25,BUZZ-Asia Day Ahead-Risk-on - Chinese data and headlines lead,"March 17 (Reuters) - In weekend news, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott
Bessent said there are 'no guarantees' there will not be a U.S. recession and
Chinese access for hundreds of U.S. meat exporters was in doubt as the ""Phase 1""
trade deal with President Donald Trump expired.
    On Friday U.S. consumer sentiment plunged due to tariff fears, while
inflation expectations jumped; and  German Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz
said he had secured the crucial backing of the Greens for a massive increase in
state borrowing.
    Wall Street jumped, Treasury yields climbed, the U.S. dollar eased and
commodities closed mixed. 
    A positive lead for Asian markets with EM ETFs up 1.8%. China's industrial
output, retail sales, urban investment and unemployment, plus Indian wholesale
prices lead the busy regional data schedule. The focus will be on the data and
any U.S. policy announcements.
    Dow +1.65%, S&P +2.12%, and Nasdaq +2.6% on bargain-hunting. Treasury yields
climbed as tariffs fuelled inflation fears; 2yr +5bp to 4.021%, 10yr +4bp to
4.318%, and 30yr +3bp to 4.627% on TradeWeb.
    Oil climbed on diminishing hopes of a quick end to the Ukraine conflict,

2025/3/14 14:49,BUZZ-FX options wrap - FX volatility risk hedges are looking attractive,"Implied volatility reflects market expectations of actual volatility and plays a
crucial role in option pricing. It has pulled back significantly from recent and
medium-term highs, particularly in sub-three-month expiries, potentially
presenting an attractive risk-reward opportunity.
Of course, lower implied volatility is indicative of lower FX realised
volatility, so the setbacks are justified while FX spot markets remain
consolidative and risk appetite improved. 
USD/JPY implied volatility led the recent charge higher but 1-month expiry has
already fully retraced the 2.0 surge to 12.4. The 1-month expiry date includes a
host of volatility risk events including both central bank policy decisions, key
US jobs and inflation data and the 2 April reciprocal tariff deadline - to
highlight its potential value. 
EUR/USD was unable to sustain a retest of the 1.0900 handle after a news report
citing a potential German government deal on the debt ceiling extension. Implied
volatility is almost unchanged after its setback from its recent test of
Januaries highs (1-month based 7.85 from 9.2).
However, sub 3-month EUR/USD risk reversals are retesting a downside strike
premium and there's been light demand for outright downside strike via vanilla
and EUR put trigger options since mid-week. 
    Other G10 currency pairs have seen their implied volatilities retrace lower
over recent sessions before running into light buying interest and potential
value levels. 
    Plenty of FX option strikes expire next week [nL1N3PX0CY]

дорожает на Мосбирже и вне ее в ожидании продолжения общения
глав США и России с возможностью последующего улучшения
отношений между Вашингтоном и Москвой, а также урегулирования
российско-украинского конфликта. 
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 17.15 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,74. Российская валюта
дорожает на 0,6%, ранее в пятницу укрепляясь до 11,68, что всего
в пяти копейках от максимума с июня прошлого года.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к этому времени
котировались вблизи отметок 11,75, 86,40 и 93,50 соответственно,
и рубль набирает 0,6% к юаню, 0,4% к доллару и 0,5% к евро.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 17.15 МСК
котировалась по 85,44, и рубль дорожает почти на один процент.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 93,00, и
рубль дорожает на две трети процента.
    ""Рубль в целом сохраняет уверенность, отражая общий
оптимистичный настрой инвесторов в геополитических переговорах.
Пока российская валюта может быть склонна к обновлению очередных
локальных максимумов против доллара, евро и юаня или
стабилизации недалеко от текущих уровней"", - считает Елена
Кожухова из компании Велес Капитал. 
    По ее мнению, заметные продажи в рубле возобновятся лишь в
том случае, если участники рынка потеряют надежду на возможность
скорого урегулирования украинского конфликта.
    В четверг вечером президент РФ Владимир Путин принял
спецпосланника президента США Стива Уиткоффа. В пятницу
президент США Дональд Трамп сообщил, что разговор с Путиным был
очень хорошим и продуктивными, отметив высокую вероятность
завершения украинского конфликта.
    Кремль, в свою очередь, сообщил, что Путин передал ""сигналы""
Трампу через Уиткоффа, и после того, как они будут доведены до
главы Белого дома, стороны смогут приступить к согласованию
разговора президентов РФ и США.
    Путин накануне согласился с предложением США о временном
прекращении огня в Украине, отметив, что любое перемирие должно
привести к долгосрочному миру и устранению первопричин
конфликта. Он при этом сказал, что есть вопросы для обсуждения,
в частности, контроль за соблюдением режима прекращения огня на
линии боевого соприкосновения и поставки Украине западного
оружия.
    Трамп вчера же назвал комментарии Путина про перемирие
многообещающими, но неполными и высказал желание поговорить с
ним.
    Во вторник Украина по итогам переговоров с США согласилась
на 30-дневное прекращение огня, если Россия пойдет на
аналогичный шаг, и Штаты возобновили передачу разведданных и
военную помощь Киеву, посчитав, что он выполнил требования
Белого дома.
    Надежды на возможность завершения украинского конфликта, а
также ожидания улучшения отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом с
последующей возможностью ослабления американских рестрикций
против России выступают в последнее время ключевой поддержкой
рублю, на фоне чего валюта США подешевела против российской с
начала года почти на четверть, европейская - почти на 21%,
биржевой рублевый курс юаня снизился за это же время на 14%.
    По мнению Дмитрия Полевого из компании Астра УА, внешний
позитив может сдвинуть курс доллара в диапазон 80-85 рублей.
    ""Но эти уровни вряд ли будут устойчивыми, поэтому во втором
полугодии ждём возврата в диапазон 90-100"", - предположил он.
    К формально в целом благоприятному для российской валюты
внешнему фону в ближайшие дни может добавиться локальный фактор
приближающихся налоговых выплат, под которые экспортеры обычно
увеличивают продажу валютной выручки за рубли. 
    Согласно расчетам Рейтер, суммарный объем февральского
нефтяного НДПИ, входящего в проводимый 28 марта Единый налоговый
платеж, составит 690 миллиардов рублей против 868 миллиардов
месяцем ранее. 
    Это чревато снижением продаж экспортной валютной выручки под
уплату нефтяниками данного налога, но оно может компенсироваться
реализацией инвалюты сырьевыми корпорациями под окончательные
расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе, по налогу на
прибыль.

сообщений о договоренности немецких партий о бюджете, которая

2025/3/14 12:55,"Рубль вновь дорожает, теперь в ожидании контактов Путина и Трампа","МОСКВА, 14 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль днем пятницы вновь
дорожает, теперь в ожидании общения глав США и России после
того, как Москва с оговорками приняла возможность перемирия с
Киевом.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 15.30 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,78, и российская валюта
дорожает на 0,3%.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к этому времени
котировались вблизи отметок 11,80, 86,60 и 93,80 соответственно,
и рубль набирает 0,2% к юаню, 0,3% к доллару и 0,2% к евро.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 15.30 МСК
котировалась по 85,50, и рубль дорожает на 0,9%.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 93,16, и
рубль дорожает на 0,5%.
    ""Несколько усилившиеся надежды на скорую деэскалацию играют
на стороне российской валюты. В связи с последними
геополитическими новостями курс (юаня) эту неделю, вероятно, все
же закончит ниже 12 рублей"", - полагают аналитики банка
Санкт-Петербург.
    Сегодня Кремль сообщил, что президент РФ Владимир Путин
передал ""сигналы"" президенту США Дональду Трампу через его
спецпосланника Стива Уиткоффа в ходе вчерашней встречи с ним, и
после того, как полученная информация будет доведена до главы
Белого дома, стороны смогут приступить к согласованию разговора
президентов РФ и США.
    Путин в четверг согласился с предложением США о временном
прекращении огня в Украине, отметив, что любое перемирие должно
привести к долгосрочному миру и устранению первопричин
конфликта. Он при этом сказал, что есть вопросы для обсуждения,
в частности, контроль за соблюдением режима прекращения огня на
линии боевого соприкосновения и поставки Украине западного
оружия.
    Президент США Дональд Трамп назвал вчерашние комментарии
Владимира Путина многообещающими, но неполными и высказал
желание поговорить с ним.
    Во вторник Украина по итогам переговоров с США согласилась
на 30-дневное прекращение огня, если Россия пойдет на
аналогичный шаг, и Штаты возобновили передачу разведданных и
военную помощь Киеву, посчитав, что он выполнил требования
Белого дома.
    Надежды на возможность завершения украинского конфликта, а
также ожидания улучшения отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом с
последующей возможностью ослабления американских рестрикций
против России выступают в последнее время ключевой поддержкой
рублю, на фоне чего валюта США подешевела против российской с
начала года почти на четверть, европейская - почти на 21%,
биржевой рублевый курс юаня снизился за это же время на 14%.
    По мнению Дмитрия Полевого из компании Астра УА, внешний
позитив может сдвинуть курс доллара в диапазон 80-85 рублей.
    ""Но эти уровни вряд ли будут устойчивыми, поэтому во втором
полугодии ждём возврата в диапазон 90-100"", - предположил он.
    К формально в целом благоприятному для российской валюты
внешнему фону в ближайшие дни может добавиться локальный фактор
приближающихся налоговых выплат, под которые экспортеры обычно
увеличивают продажу валютной выручки за рубли. 
    Согласно расчетам Рейтер, суммарный объем февральского
нефтяного НДПИ, входящего в проводимый 28 марта Единый налоговый
платеж, составит 690 миллиардов рублей против 868 миллиардов
месяцем ранее. 
    Это чревато снижением продаж экспортной валютной выручки под
уплату нефтяниками данного налога, но оно может компенсироваться
реализацией инвалюты сырьевыми корпорациями под окончательные
расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе, по налогу на
прибыль.

2025/3/14 11:05,Россия использует криптовалюты в торговле нефтью -- источники,"14 мар (Рейтер) - Россия использует криптовалюты в
торговле нефтью с Китаем и Индией для обхода западных санкций,
сказали Рейтер четыре источника, непосредственно знакомые с
ситуацией.
    Москва публично поддерживает использование криптовалют и
минувшим летом приняла закон, разрешающий платежи в цифровой
валюте в международной торговле, однако о применении ""крипты"" в
сделках с российской нефтью ранее не сообщалось.
    Некоторые российские нефтяные компании используют биткоин
<BTC=>, эфириум <ETH=> и стейблкоины, такие как Tether, для
упрощения конвертации китайских юаней <CNY=D3> <CNH=> и
индийских рупий <INR=> в российские рубли <RUB=>, сказали
источники, пожелавшие остаться анонимными из-за деликатности
вопроса. По их словам, это небольшая, но растущая часть общей
нефтяной торговли России, объем которой, согласно данным
Международного энергетического агентства, в 2024 году составил
$192 миллиарда.
    Россия создала несколько различных систем, и проводки через
USDT (Tether) - лишь одна из них, сказал пятый источник -
исследователь компании, изучающей применение криптовалют для
обхода санкций, также пожелавший остаться анонимным из-за
обязательства о неразглашении информации.
    Российский центральный банк не ответил на просьбу о
комментарии. 
    Криптовалюты, вероятно, будут использоваться в торговле
российской нефтью даже после отмены санкций и возвращения
возможности расчетов в долларах, сказал один из четырех
источников. По его словам, это удобный инструмент, позволяющий
ускорить проведение операций.

2025/3/14 9:41,RPT-BUZZ-COMMENT-Latest EUR/USD signals from forward looking FX options,"(Repeats with no changes )
       March 13 (Reuters) - Given their forward looking nature,
reliance on FX volatility and rapid directional moves, FX
options can offer clues about the perceived outlook for a
currency pair and there's been plenty of changes in EUR/USD of
late. 
    Implied volatility gauges realised volatility risk and is a
key component of an FX option premium, so it was no surprise to
see it spike up to highs since January amid the recent EUR/USD
rally from the 1.05s to the 1.09s. 
    Risk reversals charge an implied volatility premium for
options in what is perceived to be the most vulnerable direction
versus a discount in the other. During the spot rally they
rapidly reduced a long standing premium for downside strikes and
sub 3-month expiries actually flipped that premium for topside
strikes - reaching their highest levels since 2022 and 2020. 
The bulk of trade flows were concentrated on buying topside
strikes with 1.0800 and 1.1000 strikes and sub 3-month expiries,
suggesting that area was an initial target. However, 3-6-month
expiry EUR call (topside) strikes with knock-out triggers at
1.1500 were also popular and suggested 1.1500 is seen as a
topside limit over the medium term. 
    However, since EUR/USD faltered in the 1.09s, risk reversals
have reversed that topside strike premium and the benchmark
1-month expiry 25 delta contract is now almost flat - so no real
bias in either direction. It had flipped from 0.6 EUR puts to
0.6 EUR calls last week. Implied volatility has taken a hit and
the 1-month expiry is now below 8.0 from a 9.25 high. 
    The latest price action shows a market happy to close trades
that have returned some decent profits over the last two weeks
and also fits with expectations of near term FX consolidation
whilst fresh signals are awaited.

       路透北京/上海3月14日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周五收创逾四个月新高；
中间价则小跌，与路透预测偏离水平仍超700点，监管延续过滤举措维稳市场预期。市场人
士指出，中国可能进一步宽松的预期助力提升市场情绪，人民币也受到部分提振，不过关税
重压不减，市场走势料较为反复。
    
    交易员表示，全球贸易战前景依旧阴云密布，美元指数<.DXY>小幅回升，不过全球贸易
战升级反而可以缓解中国的压力，“东升西降”叙事继续推进，人民币今日还走出独立的升
势，但持续性还有待观察。
    
    “今天中国股市的情绪真的太好了，人民币估计也是受到了提振，先看200日均线能否
突破，”一外资行交易员称。
    
    
    另一外资行交易员提到，从中间价来看，意图还是保持稳定的，要看中美贸易的进展。
    
    马来亚银行观点认为，近期温和的美元利率环境能使人民币很好地受到中间价控制；到

2025/3/14 8:32,У рубля смешанная динамика в ожидании развития внешнеполитической повестки,"МОСКВА, 14 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль на пятничных торгах
показывает скромные смешанные изменения в ожидании развития
внешнеполитической повестки после того, как Россия с оговорками
приняла возможность перемирия с Украиной.
    В фокусе внимания теперь будут реальные шаги России и
Украины к прекращению огня при посредничестве США, а также
продвижение Москвы и Вашингтона к смягчению отношений,
наблюдаемое в последнее время.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 11.15 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,84, и российская валюта
теряет 0,2%.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к 11.15 МСК
котировались вблизи отметок 11,85, 87,10 и 93,95 соответственно,
и рубль теряет 0,2% к юаню и 0,3% к доллару, минимально
подрастая к евро.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 11.15 МСК
котировалась по 86,10, и рубль дорожает на 0,2%.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 93,49, и
рубль дорожает на 0,1%.
    ""Несколько усилившиеся надежды на скорую деэскалацию играют
на стороне российской валюты. В связи с последними
геополитическими новостями курс (юаня) эту неделю, вероятно, все
же закончит ниже 12 рублей"", - полагают аналитики банка
Санкт-Петербург.
    Президент РФ Владимир Путин накануне согласился с
предложением США о временном прекращении огня в Украине,
отметив, что любое перемирие должно привести к долгосрочному
миру и устранению первопричин конфликта. Он при этом сказал, что
есть вопросы для обсуждения, в частности, контроль за
соблюдением режима прекращения огня на линии боевого
соприкосновения и поставки Украине западного оружия.
    Президент США Дональд Трамп назвал комментарии Путина
многообещающими, но неполными и высказал желание поговорить с
ним.
    Во вторник Украина по итогам переговоров с США согласилась
на 30-дневное прекращение огня, если Россия пойдет на
аналогичный шаг, и параллельно Штаты возобновили передачу
разведданных и военную помощь Киеву, посчитав, что он выполнил
требования Белого дома.
    Надежды на возможность завершения украинского конфликта, а
также ожидания улучшения отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом с
последующей возможностью ослабления американских рестрикций
против России выступают в последнее время ключевой поддержкой
рублю, на фоне чего валюта США подешевела против российской с
начала года на 24%, европейская - на 20%, биржевой рублевый курс
юаня снизился за это же время почти на 14%.
    К формально в целом позитивному для российской валюты
внешнему фону в ближайшие дни может добавиться локальный фактор
приближающихся налоговых выплат, под которые экспортеры обычно
увеличивают продажу валютной выручки за рубли. 
    Согласно расчетам Рейтер, суммарный объем февральского
нефтяного НДПИ, входящего в проводимый 28 марта Единый налоговый
платеж, составит 690 миллиардов рублей против 868 миллиардов
месяцем ранее. 
    Это чревато снижением продаж экспортной валютной выручки под
уплату нефтяниками данного налога, но оно может компенсироваться
реализацией инвалюты сырьевыми корпорациями под окончательные
расчеты с бюджетом за прошлый год, в том числе, по налогу на
прибыль.

    By Sinéad Carew and Harry Robertson
       NEW YORK/LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - Global equities
sank on Thursday with the S&P 500 confirming it was in a
correction while U.S. Treasury prices rose as investors fled for
safer assets as they worried that global trade tensions would
boost inflation and slow growth after U.S. President Donald
Trump's latest tariff threats. 
    On Thursday, for the first time, the benchmark S&P 500
<.SPX> finished more than 10% below its most recent record high
close, achieved on February 19. 
     In the latest in a long list of tariff threats, Trump said
he would hit European beverage imports with duties of 200% if
the EU does not remove U.S. whiskey surcharges. This was after
his increased tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminium imports
took effect on Wednesday. 
    Thursday's Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics
data showed U.S. producer prices (PPI) were unexpectedly
unchanged in February and Wednesday's data showed consumer
prices (CPI) rising more slowly than expected.
    But last month's trends did little to reassure investors who
were bracing for the impact of trade wars on future inflation
and growth. 
    ""If it wasn't for the trade war going on, the market would
be up strongly"" on the inflation data, said Tim Ghriskey, senior
portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York. ""Traders
are focused on the trade war."" 
    ""It seems like the (U.S.) administration is being very
aggressive and promises at least at this point to be in it for
the longer term and the personalities look unlikely to back down
at least in the near term,"" said Ghriskey.  
        On Wall Street, the S&P 500 <.SPX> fell 77.78 points, or
1.39%, to 5,521.52.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was also nearing a
correction confirmation, ending down 537.36 points, or 1.30%, at
40,813.57 on Thursday, roughly 9.4% below its most recent record
closing high.
    The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> fell 345.44 points, or 1.96%,
to 17,303.01. The tech-heavy index was down more than 14% from
its recent record after confirming a correction on March 6.
    Stock market corrections are fairly common, with the S&P 500
logging a correction 56 times since 1929, according to a Reuters
analysis of data from Yardeni Research. Of these, only 22
morphed into bear markets, defined as a fall of 20% or more from
most recent record highs, the data showed.
        
  
       
    MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS> fell
9.33 points, or 1.12%, to 821.52 on Thursday, putting it more
than 7% below its most recent record high after earlier hitting
his lowest level since September.
    The pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> index earlier closed
down 0.15% after rising 0.81% in the previous day's session.
    While the U.S. S&P 500 index is now down more than 6% for
the year-to-date, European stocks have been faring better with
support from government spending plans for defence and a
potential Ukraine peace deal. Year-to-date the STOXX index is up
6.5% year to date, despite slipping in recent weeks.
    U.S. Treasury yields fell on Thursday as the equities
selloff boosted demand for safe haven U.S. government debt with 
escalating trade wars between the United States and trading
partners threatening to dent growth and boost inflation.
    The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> fell
4.6 basis points to 4.27%, from 4.316% late on Wednesday while
the 30-year bond <US30YT=RR> yield fell 4.1 basis points to
4.59%.
        The 2-year note <US2YT=RR> yield, which typically moves
in step with interest rate expectations for the Federal Reserve,
fell 4 basis points to 3.955%, from 3.995% late on Wednesday.
  
    In currencies, the U.S. dollar was a mixed bag, weakening
against Japan's safe haven yen but gaining on the euro and the
Canadian dollar.  
    Against the Japanese yen <JPY=>, the dollar weakened 0.38%
to 147.68. 
        But the euro <EUR=> was down 0.33% at $1.085 while the
Canadian dollar <CAD=> weakened 0.45% versus the greenback and
against the Swiss franc <CHF=>, the dollar strengthened 0.14%.
  
    After rallying on Wednesday on a larger-than-expected draw
in U.S. gasoline stocks, oil prices tumbled as traders weighed
macroeconomic concerns and demand versus supply expectations.
    U.S. crude <CLc1> settled down 1.67%, or $1.13 at $66.55 a
barrel and Brent <LCOc1> settled at $69.88 per barrel, down
1.51% or $1.07 on the day.
    Gold prices raced to a record high within touching distance
of the key milestone of $3,000 per ounce on Thursday, with
momentum driven by elevated tariff uncertainty and bets on
monetary policy easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
    Spot gold <XAU=> rose 1.73% to $2,982.84 an ounce. U.S. gold
futures <GCc1> rose 1.51% to $2,983.50 an ounce.

2025/3/14 6:07,Рубль малоподвижен после тестирования накануне максимума с прошлого июня,"МОСКВА, 14 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль утром пятницы показывает
минимальные положительные изменения на форексе после
существенного роста накануне, спровоцированного оптимистичной
геополитической новостной повесткой, и теперь в фокусе внимания
будут реальные шаги России и Украины к перемирию при
посредничестве США, а также движение Москвы и Вашингтона к
дальнейшему смягчению отношений.
    К формально в целом позитивному для российской валюты
внешнему фону в ближайшие дни может добавиться локальный фактор
приближающихся налоговых выплат, под которые экспортеры обычно
увеличивают продажу валютной выручки за рубли. Также поддержкой
остаются и продажи китайской валюты Центробанком, сейчас почти
на шесть миллиардов рублей в день.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 9.00 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 86,00, и рубль набирает 0,3% от уровней закрытия четверга, по
итогам которого он подорожал против доллара на 1%, вечером
подскочив на пиковое с 28 июня 2024 года значение, 83,37.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется по 93,50, рубль
набирает 0,1% от закрытия четверга, по итогам которого
российская валюта подорожала против европейской на 1,4%, вечером
достигнув отметки 90,56, близко расположенной также от максимума
рубля с прошлого июня. 
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 12,19, что вновь совпадает с последними предыдущими
показателями LSEG.
    Вчерашние же торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами
""завтра"" завершились на уровне 11,83 рубля за юань - российская
валюта в итоге подорожала на 0,9% при объеме сделок в 99
миллиардов рублей.
        Рубль почти весь четверг показывал позитивную динамику в
ожидании новостей из Москвы, и в итоге локальные рынки услышали
то, что надеялись услышать: президент РФ Владимир Путин
согласился с предложением США о временном прекращении огня в
Украине, отметив, что любое перемирие должно привести к
долгосрочному миру и устранению первопричин конфликта.
    Также добавили рыночного оптимизма слова Путина, что Россия
в закрытом режиме ведет переговоры о возвращении некоторых
иностранных компаний на рынок РФ.
    Президент США Дональд Трамп позже на брифинге в Вашингтоне
назвал комментарии Путина многообещающими, но неполными и
высказал желание поговорить с ним.
    Ранее во вторник Украина по итогам переговоров с США
согласилась на 30-дневное прекращение огня, если Россия также
пойдет на такой шаг, а параллельно Штаты возобновили передачу
разведданных и военную помощь Киеву, посчитав, что он выполнил
требования Белого дома.
    Надежды на возможность завершения украинского конфликта, а
также ожидания улучшения отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом с
последующей возможностью ослабления американских рестрикций
против России выступают в последнее время ключевой поддержкой
рублю, на фоне чего валюта США подешевела против российской с
начала года на 24%, европейская - на 20%, биржевой рублевый курс
юаня снизился за это же время почти на 14%.
    Набор текущих факторов поддержки позволяет рублю пока 
игнорировать негативные для него тенденции нефтяного рынка,
который находится в нисходящем тренде почти два месяца, а его
текущие значения остаются вблизи минимумов с декабря 2021 года.
    С середины января североморская смесь теряет в цене почти
15%, и такая динамика нефти формально является существенным
риском для рубля вкупе с последствиями западных санкций в
отношении российской ""нефтянки"" и танкерного флота РФ, поскольку
таит риски снижения притока иностранной валюты на локальный
рынок.
    Сегодня утром нефтяные котировки в плюсе, баррель Brent
<LCOc1> дорожает на две трети процента после полуторапроцентного
снижения накануне и оценивается сейчас в $70,33.

 ((ewen.chew@thomsonreuters.com))"
2025/3/14 3:46,BUZZ-COMMENT-Yuan may rally as China to detail consumption plans,"March 14 (Reuters) - 
    The yuan has relinquished some gains since the conclusion of China's annual
parliamentary meeting, at which the 2025 GDP target was affirmed. But the
possibility of more detailed consumption-boosting plans could spur a rebound
next week.
    During the National People's Congress, policymakers flagged more stimulus if
economic growth slows. The central bank on Thursday reiterated it will cut
interest rates and banks' reserve requirement ratio at an appropriate time.
Separately, China's financial regulator said it will introduce financial support
measures to boost consumption. 
    Details might be announced on Monday at a multi-agency news conference that
includes the National Development and Reform Commission, finance, commerce and
human resources ministries, and central bank.
    USD/CNY has whipsawed this week due to U.S. trade tariff escalations and
retaliation by America's trade partners. But a potentially very bearish
technical signal is developing as the yuan rallies with stocks pre-emptively
surging before the press conference.
    If USD/CNY, currently at 7.2390, ends Friday below the 100-day moving
average at 7.2489, a long-tailed doji candlestick - indicative of momentum
exhaustion - would be formed, signalling an end to the relief rally cued by
Wednesday's bounce off the 200 DMA, now at 7.2175. 
    Along with the turnaround from the 21 DMA resistance 7.2559, and failure to
close above 7.2545, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the September-January
rally, the chart strongly suggests a breakdown through the 200 DMA is due
shortly. If that pans out, the major psychological barrier of 7.2000 is likely
to break too.

       路透北京3月14日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周五早盘由跌转升；中间价继续小跌，与路透预测偏离水平仍有725点，监管延续过滤举措维稳市场预期。
    
    交易员表示，全球贸易战前景依旧阴云密布，美元指数<.DXY>出现反弹态势，不过在中国股市大涨情绪带动下，人民币亦展现韧性；短期汇价料维持区间震荡，等待更多信息指引。
    
    “从中间价来看，意图还是保持稳定的，要继续等中美贸易的进展，”一外资行交易员称。
    
    马来亚银行观点认为，近期温和的美元利率环境能使人民币很好地受到中间价控制；到目前为止，中国似乎不愿意采取强有力的针锋相对的关税报复措施，这一直保持着人民币的稳定，未来可能会允许人民币贬值，以帮助缓解美国过高关税的影响。
    
    
    美国2月生产者物价指数（PPI）七个月来首次环比持平，且上周初请失业金人数减少，暗示经济稳定，应该能够让美联储下周三维持利率不变。
    
    美国财政部长贝森特(Scott Bessent)对布赖特巴特新闻网(Breitbart News)表示，通胀可能会上升，但特朗普政府正在尽其所能抑制通胀，并指出了经济中的正面迹象。
    
    此外，美国总统特朗普周四威胁要对来自欧洲的葡萄酒、白兰地和其他酒精进口产品征收200%的关税，开启了全球贸易战的新战线。贸易战已经扰乱了金融市场，并引发了对经济衰退的担忧。
    
    北京时间11:26，人民币兑美元<CNY=CFXS>即期报7.2422元，上日收报7.2427元，夜盘终报7.244元。今日人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>报7.1738元，上日为7.1728元。截至目前人民币即期成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为196.63亿美元。

    全球汇市方面，美元周五普遍走强，欧元则进一步远离五个月高点，市场正努力应对不断升级的全球贸易紧张局势和经济急剧下滑的风险。[FRX/CN]
         
    海外无本金交割远期外汇(NDF)<CNYNDFOR=>市场上，美元/人民币一年期品种<CNY1YNDFOR=>最新报在7.06元, 上日尾盘为7.0635元。香港的离岸人民币兑美元即期<CNH=D3>最新报在7.2448元, 当前汇价与在岸即期价差为26点，上一交易日尾盘报7.2474元。（完）

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

2025/3/13 23:34,"BUZZ-Asia Day Ahead-Response to offshore caution, headlines leads","March 14 (Reuters) - 
    Overnight news led to risk-off moves in markets, as Wall Street and Treasury
yields fell, the U.S. dollar firmed, and commodities closed mixed.
    President Donald Trump told the NATO chief that the U.S. needs Greenland,
and threatened tariffs on European wines and spirits. Russian President Vladimir
Putin suggested the U.S. ceasefire idea for Ukraine needs serious reworking.
German lawmakers struggled to find a compromise on proposals for a massive
increase in state borrowing on Thursday.     
    A strong negative lead for Asian markets with EM ETFs off 0.4%. There is no
significant data in Asia on Friday, so the regional response to negative
offshore sentiment, and headlines will lead activity. 
    Dow -1.3%, S&P -1.39%, now in an official correction, off 10.1% from the
February high, and Nasdaq -1.96% as global trade tensions build.
    Safe-haven Treasury yields eased amid benign PPI and jobs data, 2yr -4bp to
3.957%, 10yr -4bp to 4.270% and 30yr -4bp to 4.592% on TradeWeb.
    Oil fell on tariff-led weaker demand expectations, Brent -1.05%, WTI -1.35%.
U.S. copper -0.2%, capped by global growth concerns. Safe-haven gold +1.9%.
    The FX market also reacted to the downbeat sentiment; the safe-haven USD
climbed <=USD> +0.25%, led by risk-sensitive commodity currencies, AUD -0.6%,
NZD -0.5%, and USD/CAD +0.5%. EUR -0.25%, GBP -0.05%, USD/JPY -0.3% amid tighter
yield spreads, and USD/CNH +0.1%.
    Bitcoin fell 3.39% to $80,702 at 6 pm in New York.

    By Sinéad Carew and Harry Robertson
       NEW YORK/LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - Global equities
and U.S. Treasury yields both fell on Thursday on worries about
global trade tensions and the potential impact on inflation and
economic growth after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened
duties of 200% on European beverage imports. 
    Trump said the latest in a long list of tariff threats would
be implemented if the EU does not remove U.S. whiskey
surcharges. This was after his increased tariffs on all U.S.
steel and aluminium imports took effect on Wednesday. 
    In contrast, Thursday's Labor Department's Bureau of Labor
Statistics data showed U.S. producer prices (PPI) were
unexpectedly unchanged in February and Wednesday's data showed
consumer prices (CPI) rising more slowly than expected.
    ""If it wasn't for the trade war going on, the market would
be up strongly"" on the inflation data, said Tim Ghriskey, senior
portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York. ""Traders
are focused on the trade war."" 
    ""It seems like the (U.S.) administration is being very
aggressive and promises at least at this point to be in it for
the longer term and the personalities look unlikely to back down
at least in the near term,"" said Ghriskey.  
         Bill Adams, Chief Economist for Comerica Bank wrote in
a research note that the inflation outlook depends more on
government policies such as tariffs, deportations and Department
of Government Efficiency (DOGE) moves than ""the backward-looking
data releases right now.""    
    On Wall Street, at 02:47 p.m. the Dow Jones Industrial
Average <.DJI> fell 399.18 points, or 0.97%, to 40,951.75. The
S&P 500 <.SPX> fell 51.21 points, or 0.91%, to 5,548.09 while 
the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> fell 231.66 points, or 1.31%, to
17,416.79.
    MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS> fell
6.69 points, or 0.81%, to 824.16.
    The pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> index earlier closed
down 0.15% after rising 0.81% in the previous day's session.
    While the U.S. S&P 500 index is now down almost 6% for the
year, European stocks are faring better with support from
government spending plans for defence and a potential Ukraine
peace deal. Year-to-date the STOXX index is up 6.5% year to
date, despite slipping in recent weeks.
    
    U.S. Treasury yields fell on Thursday as tumbling stocks
boosted demand for safe haven U.S. government debt with 
escalating trade wars between the United States and trading
partners threatening to dent growth and boost inflation.
    The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> fell
3.6 basis points to 4.28%, from 4.316% late on Wednesday.
    The 30-year bond <US30YT=RR> yield fell 2.9 basis points to
4.6016% from 4.631% late on Wednesday.
    The 2-year note <US2YT=RR> yield, which typically moves in
step with interest rate expectations for the Federal Reserve,
fell 4.2 basis points to 3.953%, from 3.995% late on Wednesday.
    In currencies, the U.S. dollar was a mixed bag, weakening
against Japan's safe haven yen but gaining on the euro and the
Canadian dollar.  
    Against the dollar, the euro <EUR=> was down 0.28% at
$1.0855 but against the Japanese yen <JPY=>, the dollar weakened
0.34% to 147.74.
    The Canadian dollar <CAD=> weakened 0.39% versus the
greenback to C$1.44 per dollar. Sterling <GBP=> weakened 0.06%
to $1.2952. 
    After rallying on Wednesday on a larger-than-expected draw
in U.S. gasoline stocks, oil prices slipped on Thursday as
traders weighed macroeconomic concerns and demand versus supply
expectations.
    U.S. crude <CLc1> settled down 1.67%, or $1.13 at $66.55 a
barrel and Brent <LCOc1> settled at $69.88 per barrel, down
1.51% or $1.07 on the day.
    Gold prices raced to a record high within touching distance
of the key milestone of $3,000 per ounce on Thursday, with
momentum driven by elevated tariff uncertainty and bets on
monetary policy easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
    Spot gold <XAU=> rose 1.71% to $2,981.92 an ounce. U.S. gold
futures <GCc1> rose 1.51% to $2,983.50 an ounce.

    By Sinéad Carew and Harry Robertson
       NEW YORK/LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - Equities around
the world fell and U.S. Treasury yields rose on Thursday as
investors worried about global trade tensions after U.S.
President Donald Trump threatened duties of 200% on European
beverage imports if the EU does not remove U.S. whiskey
surcharges.
    Investors were also keeping an eye on wrangling over a
possible, partial, U.S. government shutdown.
    Thursday's Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics
data showed U.S. producer prices (PPI) were unexpectedly
unchanged in February. This was after Wednesday's data showed
U.S. consumer prices (CPI) rose more slowly than expected. 
     But investors worried that the cooling trend would not be
sustainable as tariffs on imports raise prices in coming months.
    ""The February CPI and PPI reports were both better than
expected, and show that the turn of the year spike in inflation
was likely noise and not signal,"" said Bill Adams, Chief
Economist for Comerica Bank in a research note.
    But he wrote that the inflation outlook depends more on
government policies as tariffs, deportations and Department of
Government Efficiency (DOGE) moves than ""the backward-looking
data releases right now.""
    Trump's increased tariffs on all U.S. steel and aluminium
imports took effect on Wednesday, drawing swift retaliation from
Canada and the European Union. 
    ""The guidance out of the White House is so erratic that
investors cannot absorb every news flash into their investment
strategies,"" said Peter Andersen, founder of Andersen Capital
Management.

than expected inflation.

2025/3/13 14:46,BUZZ-FX options wrap - Key signals for the FX outlook,"March 13 (Reuters) - FX option implied volatility has
retreated from last week's new medium-term highs as realised FX
volatility subsides and both USD losses and EUR gains stall.
    The bulk of the selling has been concentrated in
shorter-dated and front-end expiries, reflecting the current
phase of FX consolidation. However, longer-dated maturities have
seen more limited declines, consistent with lingering
uncertainty over the medium-term outlook.
    The closing of many profitable EUR/USD trades has pressured
implied volatility, with benchmark 1-month expiry falling from
9.2 to 7.85 before meeting demand. One-month expiry 25 delta
risk reversals settle around flat, having jumped from 0.6 EUR
puts to long term highs for EUR calls at 0.6 last week. 
    It's worth noting an increase in demand for short-term
EUR/USD downside strikes, suggesting hedging against a potential
deeper pullback. The recent EUR rally was driven by expectations
of an imminent Ukraine ceasefire and a German government debt
limit increase - neither of which have been finalised. 
    USD/JPY implied volatility has declined alongside a drop in
downside-over-upside strike premiums, as JPY bulls lose momentum
and the pair consolidates above fresh October lows at 146.55.
Additionally, risk premiums around the Bank of Japan's March 19
policy decision have faded, with markets now anticipating no
further rate hikes until at least May.
    AUD/USD one-month implied volatility has dipped from 10.5 to
9.3 before finding support. Buyers have so far defended the
50-day moving average at 0.6272―failure to hold this level could
trigger a retest of the recent 0.6187 base, prompting fresh
demand for implied volatility.
    GBP/USD one-month implied volatility has found support in
the low 7s after pulling back from last week's 8.6 peak.

       路透北京3月13日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周四放量收升，中间价则小跌，
与路透预测偏离水平仍逾710点，监管延续过滤举措稳定市场预期。交易员称，虽然特朗普
贸易政策的不可预测性令市场惴惴不安，但中国尚未成为“主战场”，短期人民币料维持区
间波动，等待关键风险释放。
    
    “中美利差已经收窄了不少，人民币的压力明显减轻，短期大概还是区间，”一中资行
交易员称。
    
    该交易员并指出，接下来要看4月美国“对等关税”政策如何落地，以及中国采取何种
反制措施。   
  
     
    美国总统特朗普周三威胁要通过对欧盟商品进一步征收关税来升级全球贸易战，此前美
国的主要贸易伙伴表示，它们将对美国总统已经设置的贸易壁垒进行报复。
    
    瑞穗银行最新报告称，美国加征钢铝关税的措施暂未影响人民币，因这一政策现阶段暂
不会影响人民币中间价的定价；预计中国央行仍会保持中间价的稳定，同时收窄与市场价之
间的价差。
    
    中金公司观点认为，美国需求放缓有利于抑制通胀，但由于关税的不确定性，通胀放缓
之路将更加曲折不平；预计美联储会继续保持观望，重启降息或在三季度。
    
    美国2月消费者物价上涨势头有所放缓，因为住房成本上涨被航空票价下降部分抵消，
这为美联储下周维持利率不变、观望贸易战的经济影响提供了空间。
       
 
    凯投宏观高级市场经济学家James Reilly表示,“更不确定的是未来通胀前景和美国经
济活动状况，这主要归因于美国贸易政策的不可预测性。”

2025/3/13 8:40,Рубль вернулся к росту в ожидании новых геополитических вводных,"МОСКВА, 13 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль к полудню четверга
вернулся к росту в ожидании новых геополитических вводных, в
частности, участники рынка надеются услышать официальную реакцию
Москвы на предложения о перемирии в украинском конфликте.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 11.30 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,89, и российская валюта
набирает 0,3%, при этом утром юань кратковременно стоил дороже
12 рублей.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к 11.30 МСК
котировались вблизи отметок 11,91, 88,68 и 95,10 соответственно,
и рубль набирает 0,4% к юаню, 0,2% к доллару и 0,4% к евро.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 11.30 МСК
котировалась по 86,45, и рубль дорожает на 0,8%.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 94,33, и
рубль дорожает на 0,6%.
    Российское руководство пока воздерживается от официального
ответа на предложения о перемирии, но при этом Россия ранее
представила США список требований к соглашению о прекращении
огня и перезагрузке отношений с Вашингтоном, сообщили Рейтер два
источника, знакомые с ситуацией.
    Источники Рейтер охарактеризовали условия Кремля как
обширные и схожие с требованиями, которые ранее выдвигались
Украине, США и НАТО. 
    Пресс-секретарь Кремля Дмитрий Песков сегодня утром сообщил,
что президент РФ Владимир Путин может высказаться о ситуации
вокруг Украины в четверг на пресс-конференции по итогам встречи
с белорусским лидером Александром Лукашенко.
    Накануне вечером президент США Дональд Трамп сказал, что
американские представители направляются в Россию для обсуждения
30-дневного перемирия в конфликте с Украиной, при этом он
посулил Москве ""разрушительные санкции"", если та не пойдет на
мирные переговоры.
    По итогам переговоров с США Киев согласился на 30-дневное
прекращение огня, если Москва также пойдет на такой шаг, после
чего Штаты возобновили передачу разведданных и военную помощь
Украине, посчитав, что она выполнила требования Белого дома.
    Надежды на возможность завершения украинского конфликта, а
также ожидания улучшения отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом с
последующей возможностью ослабления американских рестрикций
против России выступают основной поддержкой рублю, который во
вторник подорожал против доллара до максимума с начала прошлого
августа, отметки 85,12.
    На стороне рубля сейчас также выступает высокая ключевая
ставка ЦБР, охлаждающая внутренний потребительский спрос, что в
том числе приводит к сокращению покупок инвалюты импортерами. В
пользу рубля - валютные интервенции Центробанка, который в марте
продает китайские юани почти на 6 миллиардов рублей в день.

2025/3/13 8:24,BUZZ-COMMENT-Latest EUR/USD signals from forward looking FX options,"March 13 (Reuters) - Given their forward looking nature,
reliance on FX volatility and rapid directional moves, FX
options can offer clues about the perceived outlook for a
currency pair and there's been plenty of changes in EUR/USD of
late. 
    Implied volatility gauges realised volatility risk and is a
key component of an FX option premium, so it was no surprise to
see it spike up to highs since January amid the recent EUR/USD
rally from the 1.05s to the 1.09s. 
    Risk reversals charge an implied volatility premium for
options in what is perceived to be the most vulnerable direction
versus a discount in the other. During the spot rally they
rapidly reduced a long standing premium for downside strikes and
sub 3-month expiries actually flipped that premium for topside
strikes - reaching their highest levels since 2022 and 2020. 
    The bulk of trade flows were concentrated on buying topside
strikes with 1.0800 and 1.1000 strikes and sub 3-month expiries,
suggesting that area was an initial target. However, 3-6-month
expiry EUR call (topside) strikes with knock-out triggers at
1.1500 were also popular and suggested 1.1500 is seen as a
topside limit over the medium term. 
    However, since EUR/USD faltered in the 1.09s, risk reversals
have reversed that topside strike premium and the benchmark
1-month expiry 25 delta contract is now almost flat - so no real
bias in either direction. It had flipped from 0.6 EUR puts to
0.6 EUR calls last week. Implied volatility has taken a hit and
the 1-month expiry is now below 8.0 from a 9.25 high. 
    The latest price action shows a market happy to close trades
that have returned some decent profits over the last two weeks
and also fits with expectations of near term FX consolidation
whilst fresh signals are awaited.

2025/3/13 7:43,"Юань стабилен на фоне роста доходности госбондов КНР, в фокусе - торговая война","ШАНХАЙ, 13 мар (Рейтер) - Китайский юань мало меняется в
паре с долларом в четверг, получив некоторую поддержку на фоне
роста доходности государственных облигаций КНР, в то время как
инвесторы оценивали последствия эскалации глобальной торговой
войны.
    Вопреки консенсусу рынка, юань удерживает позиции даже после
того, как пошлины вступили в силу, и доходность госбондов
выросла вместо ожидаемого снижения, указал Ларри Ху из
Macquarie.
    Аналитик назвал недавнее ослабление доллара и успех
китайского стартапа DeepSeek причинами улучшения аппетита к
риску, который, в свою очередь, оказывает поддержку юаню.
    Доходность 10-летних госбондов Китая выросла более чем на 20
базисных пунктов с февраля, поскольку ожидания насчет скорого
снижения процентных ставок упали, и условия финансирования на
межбанковском рынке остаются жесткими.
    ""Тем не менее, надо быть осторожными с экстраполяцией
краткосрочного тренда, поскольку фундаментальные показатели
остаются слабыми. Тенденция укрепления юаня и роста доходности
облигаций станет более устойчивой при восстановлении внутреннего
спроса"", - сказал Ху.
    Спотовый юань в Китайской системе валютной торговли SFETS на
материковом рынке <CNY=CFXS> к 10:00 МСК был стабилен на уровне
7,24?, а на офшорном рынке <CNH=> мало менялся возле отметки
7,2404.
     Президент США Дональд Трамп в среду пригрозил новыми
пошлинами на импорт товаров из Евросоюза, после того как
основные торговые партнеры США сообщили, что примут ответные
меры в связи с уже возведенными Трампом торговыми барьерами.
    Торговые разногласия накаляются, и исключительность США,
возможно, угасает, сказал Чан Вэй Лян из DBS, имея в виду
опережающие показатели американской экономики и активов в
последние годы.
    Перед открытием сессии ЦБ Китая объявил срединный
фиксированный курс юаня <CNY=PBOC> на уровне 7,1728 за доллар.
При этом значение оказалось на 711 pips (десятитысячных долей
процентного пункта) сильнее приведенного Рейтер прогноза
аналитиков.

However, investor sentiment remained cautious as US President Donald Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs took effect on Wednesday, raising fears of a widening global trade war

Japan (NKY:IND) rose 0.27% to surpass 37,200, while the broader Topix Index gained 1% to 2,720 on Thursday, reaching their highest levels in a week. The Japanese yen stabilized around 148 per dollar on Wednesday after falling for two consecutive sessions.

China (SHCOMP) fell 0.75% to dip below 3,370, while the Shenzhen Component lost 0.8% to 10,755 on Thursday, marking a second consecutive session of declines as investors grappled with a lack of market-moving catalysts in China. Analysts have raised concerns about China's ability to meet its economic targets, as outlined in the recently concluded Two Sessions annual meetings, and the offshore yuan

Hong Kong (HSI) fell 1.33% to 23,530 in early trading on Thursday, extending losses from the prior session amid declines in tech and consumer stocks.

Meanwhile, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong recognized the Stock Exchange of Thailand, allowing Bangkok-listed firms to pursue secondary listings.

India (SENSEX) rose 0.27% to 74,278 in early deals on Thursday, breaking a four-session losing streak.

Domestic data also lifted sentiment, as retail inflation eased more than anticipated, falling below the RBI's target range for the first time in six months, raising hopes for interest rate cuts. Additionally, industrial output grew more than expected in January.

Australia (AS51) fell 0.48% to above 7,800 on Thursday, recovering slightly from seven-month lows. The Australian dollar climbed above $0.632 on Thursday, marking its third consecutive session of gains.

Private house approvals in Australia increased by 1.1% month-on-month to 9,042 units in January 2025, matching flash data and reversing a 2.8% decline from the previous month.

In the U.S., on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended mixed followed a softer-than-expected February inflation report, which helped ease concerns about the economy and the impact of tariffs on prices.

U.S. stock futures lower on Thursday: Dow -0.27%; S&P 500 -0.41%; Nasdaq -0.66%.

Currencies: (JPY:USD), (CNY:USD), (AUD:USD), (INR:USD), (HKD:USD), (NZD:USD).

2025/3/13 6:46,Рубль малоподвижен в ожидании ответа Москвы на предложения о перемирии,"МОСКВА, 13 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль утром четверга
малоподвижен на форексе после снижения накануне, и его
дальнейшее поведение будет зависеть от новостной повестки, в
частности, участники рынка ожидают реакцию Москвы на предложения
о перемирии в украинском конфликте. Свою роль продолжат играть и
реальные денежные потоки.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 9.35 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 86,85, и рубль набирает треть процента от уровней закрытия
среды, по итогам которой он подешевел против доллара на 1,8%.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется по 94,93, и рубль
теряет менее 0,1% от закрытия среды, по итогам которой
российская валюта подешевела против европейской на полтора
процента. 
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 12,19, что совпадает с последними вчерашними
показателями LSEG.
    Вчерашние же торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами
""завтра"" завершились на уровне 11,94 рубля за юань - российская
валюта в итоге подешевела на 0,7% при объеме сделок в 100
миллиардов рублей.
    Рубль накануне ослабел на фоне отсутствия свежих
положительных геополитических новостей, тогда как сложившуюся на
среду краткосрочную новостную повестку участники рынка не смогли
воспринять как сугубо позитивную, что снизило спекулятивный
спрос на российскую валюту и спровоцировало частичную фиксацию
прибыли после уверенного укрепления рубля в начале недели.
Параллельно против рубля могла играть покупка российскими
импортерами и населением заметно подешевевшей с начала недели
иностранной валюты.
    По итогам переговоров с США во вторник Киев согласился на
30-дневное прекращение огня, если Москва также пойдет на такой
шаг, а параллельно Штаты возобновили передачу разведданных и

Белого дома.

американские представители направляются в Россию для обсуждения
30-дневного перемирия в конфликте с Украиной, при этом он
посулил Москве ""разрушительные санкции"", если та не пойдет на
мирные переговоры.
    Невзирая на вчерашнее ослабление, российская валюта остается
недалеко от многомесячных максимумов, в частности, от
достигнутой во вторник впервые с начала прошлого августа отметки
85,12 рубля за доллар.
    Ключевой поддержкой для рубля в текущем году выступают
надежды на возможность завершения украинского конфликта, а также
ожидания улучшения отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом с
последующей возможностью ослабления американских рестрикций
против России.

    Тем временем на внешних рынках нефть показывает небольшое
снижение после роста накануне. Баррель Brent <LCOc1> дешевеет на
0,3% и котируется по $70,74, тогда как в среду он подорожал на
2%.
    Валюта США в четверг утром показывает едва заметные
положительные изменения по отношению к корзине из шести ключевых
валют, индекс доллара оценивается в 103,59 <=USD>. 
    Пара евро/доллар котируется по $1,0877 <EUR=>, снижаясь на
0,1%.
    Китайский юань минимально дешевеет как на континентальном
рынке КНР (7,2402) <CNY=>, так и на офшорном (7,2410) <CNH=>.

2025/3/13 4:28,Yuan firms on rising China bond yields; trade war in focus,"SHANGHAI, March 13 (Reuters) - China's yuan firmed
against the dollar on Thursday, underpinned by a rise in
domestic bond yields as investors assessed the impact of an
escalating global trade war. 
    Contrary to market consensus, the yuan has held steady
despite higher tariffs, while government bond yields have risen
rather than fallen, said Larry Hu, an economist at Macquarie.
    Hu attributed recent weakness in the dollar and the success
of local startup DeepSeek as reasons behind improved risk
sentiment, which in turn, supports the yuan. 
    The dollar index <=USD>, which measures the currency against
a basket of six major peers, slipped 0.029% at 103.56, hovering
near a 4-month low. 
    Meanwhile, higher bond yields underpinned the yuan. 
    China's 10-year bond yield has risen more than 20 basis
points since February, as investors lowered their expectations
for an imminent rate cut and funding conditions in the interbank
market remained tight. 
    ""However, one should be cautious in extrapolating the
near-term trend, as the fundamentals remain weak. The trend of
stronger yuan and higher bond yields will be more sustainable if
domestic demand picks up,"" Hu said.
    The spot yuan <CNY=CFXS> opened at 7.2350 per dollar and was
last trading at 7.233 as of 0323 GMT, 53 pips firmer than the
previous late session close, and 0.84% weaker than the midpoint.
    U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened further
tariffs on European Union goods. This move comes as major U.S.
trading partners announced they would retaliate against trade
barriers already erected by him. 
    Trade tensions are rising and the outlook for U.S.
exceptionalism could be fading, said Chang Wei Liang, currency
and credit strategist at DBS, referring to the outperformance of
the U.S. economy and assets in recent years.
    ""Even a softer February consumer price index (CPI) print
could only give a muted boost to U.S. stocks,"" he said.
    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China set
the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed
to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1728 per dollar, 711 pips firmer
than a Reuters' estimate.
    The offshore yuan traded at 7.2335 yuan per dollar <CNH=>,
up about 0.11% in Asian trade.

       路透北京3月13日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周四早盘反弹逾百点；中间价则小跌，与路透预测偏离水平仍逾710点，监管料延续过滤举措稳定市场预期。
    
    交易员表示，美国通胀压力暂缓，而美债收益率反弹为美元走势提供支撑，同时受特朗普威胁升级全球贸易战影响，短期市场情绪料保持谨慎，人民币大概率维持区间波动。
    
    “短期关税政策的扰动可能更大，美元出现反弹可能性不小，”一外资行交易员称。
    
    美国总统特朗普周三威胁要通过对欧盟商品进一步征收关税来升级全球贸易战，此前美国的主要贸易伙伴表示，它们将对美国总统已经设置的贸易壁垒进行报复。
    
    “更不确定的是未来通胀前景和美国经济活动状况，这主要是由于美国贸易政策的不可预测性，”凯投宏观高级市场经济学家James Reilly说，“现在是这些问题在推动市场，(通胀)报告并未对这些问题提供新的指引。”
    
    中金公司观点认为，美国需求放缓有利于抑制通胀，但由于关税的不确定性，通胀放缓之路将更加曲折不平；预计美联储会继续保持观望，重启降息或在三季度。
    
    美国2月消费者物价上涨势头有所放缓，因为住房成本上涨被航空票价下降部分抵消，这为美联储下周维持利率不变、观望贸易战的经济影响提供了空间。

    北京时间10:54，人民币兑美元<CNY=CFXS>即期报7.2325元，上日收报7.2445元，夜盘终报7.2383元。今日人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>报7.1728元，上日为7.1696元。截至目前人民币即期成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为155.84亿美元。

2025/3/12 15:11,Рубль ослабел без свежего геополитического допинга,"МОСКВА, 12 мар (Рейтер) - Российская валюта в среду
дешевеет на фоне отсутствия свежих положительных геополитических
новостей, тогда как сложившуюся сейчас краткосрочную новостную
повестку участники рынка не оценивают как сугубо позитивную для
курса рубля, что сегодня снизило спекулятивный спрос на него и
спровоцировало частичную фиксацию прибыли.
    Параллельно против рубля могла играть реальная покупка
российскими импортерами заметно подешевевшей с начала недели
иностранной валюты.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 17.45 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,95, и российская валюта
теряет 0,9%.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 17.45 МСК
котировалась по 87,05, и рубль дешевеет на 1,9%.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 94,86, и
рубль здесь слабеет на 1,5%.
    Центробанк с учетом совершавшихся сегодня на российских
биржевом и внебиржевом рынках сделок установил официальные
курсы: 11,92 рубля за юань, 86,62 за доллар и 93,97 за евро
против действовавших 11,85, 86,57 и 93,66 соответственно.
    ""Настроения на рынке определяет новостная повестка,
связанная с мирными переговорами. При этом высокая
неопределенность дальнейшего развития ситуации будет сохраняться
до пятницы, когда планируется телефонный разговор президентов
России и США"", - сказал Денис Попов из ПСБ.
    По его мнению, в текущих условиях игра на укрепление
российской валюты скорее всего прекратится и биржевые котировки
перейдут к консолидации в районе 11,70-12,20 рубля за юань.
    По итогам переговоров с США во вторник Киев сообщил, что
готов прекратить огонь на 30 дней, если и Москва согласится на
такой же шаг. Этот фактор формально может учитываться как
позитивный.
    Госсекретарь США Марко Рубио сказал, что в среду Соединенные
Штаты свяжутся с российской стороной и обсудят вопрос о
30-дневном прекращении огня с Украиной и шаги к завершению
конфликта.
    Параллельно США возобновляют передачу разведданных и военную
помощь Украине, посчитав, что она выполнила требования Белого
дома, и это решение может выступать раздражителем для российских
властей, одновременно добавляя волатильности на локальном
валютном рынке.
    ""Вчера состоялись переговоры американской и украинской
делегаций, по итогам которых, вполне возможно, Штаты будут
продвигать идею 30-дневного прекращения огня. Не уверены, что
Россия примет этот вариант, и в этом случае США могут начать
оказывать экономическое давление на РФ"", - сказал Алексей
Антонов из компании Велес Капитал.
    По его мнению, для продолжения роста российской валюте нужны
позитивные геополитические новости, а с этим в ближайшее время
""может быть напряженка"".
    Важной темой в этой связи будут предполагаемые консультации
России и США вплоть до высшего уровня, которые анонсировались
накануне, в том числе американским президентом Дональдом
Трампом.
    Невзирая на сегодняшнюю динамику, российская валюта остается
недалеко от многомесячных максимумов, в частности, от
достигнутой накануне впервые с начала прошлого августа отметки
85,12 рубля за доллар.
    На стороне рубля сейчас также выступает высокая ключевая
ставка ЦБР, охлаждающая внутренний потребительский спрос, что в
том числе приводит к сокращению покупок инвалюты импортерами. В
пользу рубля и валютные интервенции Центробанка, который в марте
продает китайские юани почти на 6 миллиардов рублей в день.
    Набор текущих факторов поддержки позволяет рублю почти не
реагировать на 14-процентное падение нефтяных цен за неполные
два месяца.

2025/3/12 14:42,BUZZ-FX options wrap - FX volatility fear gauges reverse course,"Implied volatility gauges realised volatility risk and is a key parameter of FX
option premiums. Its under broad based pressure and extending setbacks from
recent and 2025 highs. 
    The U.S. CPI data came in slightly softer than expected, easing concerns
that new tariffs could trigger stagflation. This helped stabilise the recent
stock market decline and sparked a modest recovery in broader risk appetite―key
factors contributing to lower option premiums.
    USD/JPY options have seen the sharpest reversal, driven by the GPIF news on
Tuesday and spot since regaining 149.20 from 146.55. Benchmark 1-month expiry
implied volatility reverts to 11.0 from a 12.4 peak and 1-month risk reversals
from 1.85 to 1.3 JPY calls over puts. Barriers at 145.00 remain intact to reward
those long JPY calls with RKO triggers. 
    EUR/USD 1-month expiry implied volatility reverts to 8.3 from 9.0 on
Tuesday, while sub 3-month expiry risk reversals had already unwound the bulk of
last week's gains to new multi year highs for topside strikes. Those setbacks
were aided by a supply of newly acquired EUR calls with RKO triggers - many at
1.1500. 
    GBP/USD 1-month implied volatility falls back to 7.7 from last weeks 8.6
peak and 1-month AUD/USD to 9.7 from 10.5.
    There is potential for deeper declines in implied volatility, particularly
in shorter-dated expiries, if risk appetite remains stable and FX markets
continue consolidating recent moves.

短暂升至7.2158的近四个月新高，离岸CNH<CNH=D3>也一度升破7.22关口，触及7.2155的近

等待稍微美国关键的通胀数据的更多指引。虽然外部环境改善，但人民币升值缺乏基本面支
持，加上特朗普不断加码关税，逢低购汇需求很容易卷土重来，限制人民币反弹空间。

是要谨慎，美债可能给美元提供支撑。”
    
    马来亚银行观点指出，英镑和欧元飙升有利于非美货币走强，目前人民币的外部环境更

2025/3/12 8:52,Юань обновил максимум 4мес: опасения об экономике США давят на доллар,"ШАНХАЙ, 12 мар (Рейтер) - Юань идет вниз в среду, но
ранее в ходе сессии укрепился до максимума четырех месяцев по
отношению к доллару - на ""зеленый"" оказывают давление тревоги об
экономике США, вызванные непредсказуемой торговой политикой
президента США Дональда Трампа.
    Трамп отказался во вторник от сделанного несколькими часами
ранее обещания удвоить запланированные пошлины на всю стальную и
алюминиевую продукцию из Канады. Эти шарахания озадачили
финансовые рынки.
    Спотовый юань в Китайской системе валютной торговли SFETS на
материковом рынке <CNY=CFXS> к 10:13 МСК снизился на 0,24% до?
7,245?, а на офшорном рынке <CNH=> подешевел на 0,29% до 7,2463,
отметившись в ходе сессии на самом сильном уровне с ноября 2024
года. 
    Индекс доллара к корзине из шести основных валют <.DXY> к
10:13 МСК вырос на 0,37% до 103,671?, однако просел накануне до
минимума с октября 2024 года.
    Ослабление доллара оказывает поддержку юаню, сказали
аналитики.
    ""Юань, по иронии, находится в более благоприятной среде на
данный момент, поддержку ему также оказывает пока что довольно
обнадеживающее заседание Всекитайского собрания народных
представителей"", - говорится в записке аналитиков Maybank.
    Юаню также благоприятствуют сообщения о переговорах между
США и Китаем, а также о возможности саммита в июне.
    Тем не менее аналитики Maybank сказали, что настроения
вокруг юаня в ближайшей перспективе остаются очень
чувствительными к риску эскалации торгового конфликта между
Вашингтоном и Пекином. 
    Перед открытием сессии ЦБ Китая объявил срединный
фиксированный курс <CNY=PBOC> на уровне 7,1696 за доллар. При
этом значение оказалось на 628 pips (десятитысячных долей
процентного пункта) сильнее приведенного Рейтер прогноза
аналитиков.

 (Бюро Рейтер в Шанхае)"
2025/3/12 8:18,Рубль дешевеет в ожидании развития свежей геополитической повестки,"МОСКВА, 12 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль в среду котируется в
минусе, поскольку участники рынка воздерживаются от
спекулятивной покупки российской валюты, продолжая анализировать
итоги вчерашних переговоров США и Украины, а также оценивая
дальнейшие возможные действия Москвы и Киева как участников
российско-украинского конфликта, у которого появились шансы
приостановки.
    Параллельно негативно для рубля проявляет себя локальный
реальный спрос на заметно подешевевшую с начала недели
иностранную валюту.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 11.00 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,93, и российская валюта
теряет 0,7%.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к 11.00 МСК
котировались вблизи отметок 11,95, 87,85 и 95,25 соответственно,
и рубль теряет 0,9% к юаню, 1% к доллару и 0,8% к евро.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 11.00 МСК
котировалась по 86,40, и рубль дешевеет на 0,9%.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 94,33, и
рубль здесь также дешевеет на 0,9%.
    ""Настроения на рынке определяет новостная повестка,
связанная с мирными переговорами. При этом высокая
неопределенность дальнейшего развития ситуации будет сохранятся
до пятницы, когда планируется телефонный разговор президентов
России и США"", - сказал Денис Попов из ПСБ. По его мнению, в
текущих условиях игра на укрепление российской валюты скорее
всего прекратится и биржевые котировки перейдут к консолидации в
районе 11,70-12,20 рубля за юань.
    По итогам переговоров с США во вторник Киев сообщил, что
готов прекратить огонь на 30 дней, если и Москва согласится на
такой же шаг. Этот фактор формально может учитываться как
позитивный. 
    Параллельно США возобновляют передачу разведданных и военную
помощь Украине, посчитав, что она выполнила требования Белого
дома, и это решение может выступать раздражителем для российских
властей, одновременно добавляя волатильности на локальном
валютном рынке.
    ""Вчера состоялись переговоры американской и украинской
делегаций, по итогам которых, вполне возможно, Штаты будут
продвигать идею 30-дневного прекращения огня. Не уверены, что
Россия примет этот вариант, и в этом случае США могут начать
оказывать экономическое давление на РФ"", - сказал Алексей
Антонов из компании Велес Капитал.
    По его мнению, для продолжения роста российской валюты нужны
позитивные геополитические новости, а с этим в ближайшее время
""может быть напряженка"".
    Важной темой в этой связи будут предполагаемые консультации
России и США вплоть до высшего уровня, которые анонсировались
накануне, в том числе и американским президентом Дональдом
Трампом.
    Невзирая на сегодняшнюю динамику, российская валюта остается
недалеко от многомесячных максимумов, в частности, от
достигнутой накануне впервые с начала прошлого августа отметки
85,12 рубля за доллар. 
    Тем временем на внешних рынках нефть показывает небольшой
рост, баррель Brent <LCOc1> котируется по $69,80 (+0,3%).
Поддержкой может выступать подешевевший доллар, на фоне которого
нефть стала более доступной для покупателей, рассчитывающихся за
нее американской валютой.
    Индекс доллара накануне снижался до отметки 103,21 впервые с
середины октября прошлого года. Сейчас доллар по отношению к
корзине из шести ключевых валют набирает 0,1% и оценивается в
103,52 <=USD>. 
    Активность внешних рынков может быть пониженной в ожидании
публикации (15.30 МСК) данных о февральской потребительской
инфляции в США, которая должна дать подсказки о траектории
процентных ставок ФРС.

2025/3/12 7:15,人民币衍生品：境内美元/人民币长端掉期触五个月高点后回落，单边走势或趋尾声,"路透上海3月12日 - 本周中国银行间市场资金面有所改善，境内美元流动性也从充裕转向均衡，美元/人民币短端掉期<CNYTN=CFXS>较上周略有回落；交易员称，银行间流动性或保持“稳中从紧”，短端掉期跌幅有限。
    
    交易员并表示，近期美元/人民币长端掉期<CNY1Y=CFXS>主要由中美利差变化指引，特朗普的各种政策引发美国“衰退”担忧，中美负利差收窄周二一度推高长端掉期至-1,930点的近五个月新高，但美债收益率续跌空间或不大，长端掉期料保持高位震荡。
    
    “目前看长端的上行空间应该没多少了，一方面利差很难再收窄，另一方面套利空间也基本没有，”一外资行交易员称。
    
    
    
    年初以来的长端掉期套利由于收益明确，外资行和部分中资行买需不减，掉期估值快速修复，随后中美负利差收窄，也助力长端掉期进一步上行。
    
    一中资行交易员表示，人民币利率继续反弹似乎是比较确定的，但后续美元利率走向不好判断，毕竟美指已经回到特朗普当选前的水平，另外市场已定价美联储年内三次降息但经济数据整体依然韧性。
    
    国金证券宏观团队就认为，美国“衰退”叙事只是众多现实叙事中的一种，但“美国经济离真正的现实衰退还有距离，居民部门的资产负债表依然健康，企业部门的现金流和兑现业绩依然强劲。”
    
    特朗普重新上台之后，不断反复的关税政策和大规模裁员，市场谨慎情绪不断升温，市场从先前的乐观和高通胀预期逐渐转向衰退预期。
    
    根据芝商所的FedWatch工具，美联储5月降息的概率接近50%，年内降息空间已经达到77点，也就意味着有三次的降息空间。
    
    
    上周五美国公布的非农就业数据不及预期，1月数据也下修，不过美联储主席鲍威尔继续表态称无需仓促降息；关税导致的价格一次性跳涨并不需要货币政策做出回应。
    
    也有市场人士认为，近期美股下跌也很难让美联储启动降息，除非后续的美国经济数据明显转差。关注周三晚些时候美国公布的2月核心CPI数据。
    
    北京时间14:57，境内美元/人民币隔夜期掉期<CNYON=CFXA>报-5.4点，一周期掉期<CNYSW=CFXA>报-36.8点，一个月期<CNY1M=CFXA>报-162.9点，一年期<CNY1Y=CFXA>报-1,977点，上周五收盘四个期限掉期点分别收在-14.5点、-35.2点、-154.9点和-1,949点。

    根据利率平价模型，多数情况下美元/人民币掉期点与中美利差正相关，即当中美利差扩大时，美元/人民币掉期点相应上涨，反之亦然；其中一年期掉期走势是美元/人民币掉期市场的重要标杆。（完）

2025/3/12 6:36,"Asia markets mostly in red, mirroring Wall Street losses amid global tariff uncertainty","Asia markets mostly in red, mirroring Wall Street losses amid global tariff uncertaintyAsia-Pacific markets mostly lower on Wednesday, tracking a fall on Wall Street overnight amid global tariff uncertainty. Traders continued to monitor global trade policy after President Trump's threat to double his planned tariffs on steel and aluminum for Canada.

Traders also digested reports that Ukraine had agreed to an immediate 30-day ceasefire with Russia during talks with the U.S. in Saudi Arabia.

Japan (NKY:IND) rose 0.28% edged up 0.1% to around 36,830, while the broader Topix Index gained 0.8% to 2,692 on Wednesday. BoJ Gov Ueda signals no immediate intervention as JGB yields climb.

Japan's producer prices rose 4.0% Y/Y in February 2025, marking the 48th consecutive month of inflation, following the fastest growth in 20 months of 4.2% in January.

Separately, Japan's major companies, Toyota and Hitachi, have agreed to significant wage increases for the third consecutive year to combat rising inflation and alleviate labor shortages, with Hitachi pledging a 6.2% monthly wage increase and Toyota offering bonuses worth 7.6 months' salary.

China (SHCOMP) fell 0.16% fluctuated around the flatline on Wednesday as investors awaited further policy signals from Beijing following the conclusion of the Two Sessions annual meetings, and the offshore yuan strengthened to around 7.22 per dollar, reaching a four-month-high, supported by a depreciating US dollar.

In China, the annual parliamentary gathering concluded Tuesday, approving the central budget for 2025 and adopting a resolution on the 2024 work.

Hong Kong (HSI) fell 0.70% to 23,813 in a volatile trading session on Wednesday morning after a muted close the day before.

India (SENSEX) fell 0.26% to 73,920 in the morning trade on Wednesday, after being flat in the previous session.

Traders awaited India's February headline inflation data later today.

Australia (AS51) fell 1.58% dropping below 7,800 to reach a seven-month low after US President Donald Trump ruled out exempting Australia from his 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel. The Australian dollar hovered around $0.629 on Wednesday, remaining under pressure this week after US President Donald Trump ruled out exempting Australia from his 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel―key exports worth nearly $1 billion.

Despite the setback, Australia will not impose reciprocal tariffs on the US and will continue seeking an exemption from the Trump administration's 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Wednesday.

In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended lower amid trade policy uncertainty.

U.S. stock futures modestly rise on Wednesday, after a weak day on Wall Street overnight ahead of CPI prints later today: Dow +0.19%; S&P 500 +0.24%; Nasdaq +0.28%.

Meanwhile, investors now await the U.S. CPI report, due later in the day, to analyze the Federal Reserve's interest rate path amid escalating trade tensions and economic slowdown fears.

Currencies: (JPY:USD), (CNY:USD), (AUD:USD), (INR:USD), (HKD:USD), (NZD:USD).

More on Asia:

 * 
 * Japan Q4 GDP growth revised slightly lower; annualized basis economy expands by 2.2%
 * China's CPI fell for first time in 13 months, PPI deflation persists
 * China's trade surplus surpass forecasts, exports grow by 2.3% and imports shrink

2025/3/12 6:36,Рубль утром оценивает свежие геополитические инициативы и новости,"МОСКВА, 12 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль утром среды показывает
скромные изменения на форексе, поскольку участники рынка
анализируют итоги вчерашних переговоров США и Украины, а также
оценивают дальнейшее возможное поведение Москвы и Киева как
участников российско-украинского конфликта, у которого появились
шансы приостановки.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 9.20 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 85,85, рубль теряет 0,3% от вчерашнего закрытия. По итогам
вторника российская валюта укрепилась против американской на
2,3%, в течение торгов достигнув лучшего значения с начала
августа прошлого года, отметки 85,12. Во вчерашней динамике
рублевого курса доллара находило свое отражение и ослабление
валюты США на форексе до многомесячных минимумов. 
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется по 93,32, и рубль
набирает 0,2% от закрытия вторника, по итогам которого
российская валюта подорожала против европейской на полтора
процента. 
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 12,19, что совпадает с последними вчерашними
показателями LSEG.
    Вчерашние торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра""
завершились на уровне 11,85 рубля за юань - российская валюта в
итоге укрепилась на 0,2% при объеме сделок в 124 миллиарда
рублей, в течение сессии отметившись на двухнедельном максимуме,
отметке 11,72, что всего в девяти копейках от пикового значения
июня прошлого года.
    Ключевой поддержкой для рубля вчера по-прежнему выступали
надежды на скорое завершение конфликта в Украине, а также на
улучшение отношений между Кремлем и Белым домом с последующей
возможностью ослабления американских санкций против России.
Локальный валютный рынок мог в позитивном ключе отыгрывать и
новости о продвижении российских войск к границам Курской
области, часть которой в начале августа прошлого года была взята
под контроль украинскими войсками, что привело тогда в том числе
к ослаблению рубля.
    Накануне стало известно по итогам переговоров США и Украины,
что Киев готов прекратить огонь на 30 дней, если и Москва
согласится на такой же шаг. Этот фактор формально может
учитываться как позитивный.
    Параллельно США возобновляют передачу разведданных и военную
помощь Украине, посчитав, что она выполнила требования Белого
дома, и это решение может выступать раздражителем для российских
властей, одновременно добавляя волатильности на локальном
валютном рынке.
    В этой связи важной темой будут предполагаемые консультации
России и США вплоть до высшего уровня, которые анонсировались
накануне, в том числе и американским президентом Дональдом
Трампом.
    Тем временем, на внешних рынках нефть показывает
полупроцентный рост, баррель Brent <LCOc1> котируется по $69,92.
Поддержкой может выступать подешевевший доллар, на фоне которого
нефть стала более доступной для покупателей, рассчитывающихся за
нее американской валютой.
    Тем не менее за неполные два месяца североморская смесь
потеряла в цене почти 15%, оставаясь сейчас вблизи минимумов с
декабря 2021 года.
    Индекс доллара накануне снижался до отметки 103,21 впервые с
середины октября прошлого года, а вчерашние потери составили
полпроцента. В среду утром доллар по отношению к корзине из
шести ключевых валют набирает 0,1% и оценивается в 103,52
<=USD>. Пара евро/доллар накануне достигла значения $1,0947
впервые за пять месяцев, сейчас она котируется по $1,0908
<EUR=>, снижаясь на 0,1% с начала среды.
    Доллар оказался под давлением рисков возможной рецессии в
США из-за последствий протекционистской внешнеэкономической
политики Трампа.
    Сейчас же активность форекса может быть пониженной в
ожидании публикации (15.30 МСК) данных о февральской
потребительской инфляции в США, которая может дать подсказки о
траектории процентных ставок ФРС.

2025/3/12 4:35,China's yuan firms to 4-month high as US worries weigh on dollar,"SHANGHAI, March 12 (Reuters) - China's yuan climbed to a
four-month high against the dollar on Wednesday, as the
greenback was hobbled by U.S. economic worries caused by
President Donald Trump's unpredictable trade policies.
    Trump reversed course on Tuesday afternoon on a pledge to
double tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada to 50%, just
hours after announcing the higher tariffs, in rapid-fire moves
that confused financial markets. 
    The dollar index <.DXY> edged up in early Asian trade, after
dropping overnight to its lowest level since October 2024.
    China's onshore <CNY=CFXS> and offshore yuan <CNH=D3> both
firmed to the stronger side of 7.22 per dollar in early trades,
the highest levels since November 2024.  
    A weak dollar was helping the yuan, analysts said.
    ""Yuan is, ironically, in a more benign environment at this
point, boosted also by a rather encouraging National People's
Congress (NPC) thus far,"" said analysts at Maybank in a note.
    Also helping the yuan were reports of talks between the U.S.
and China and a potential ""birthday summit"" in June between the
leaders of the world's two largest economies. 
    Still, Maybank analysts said sentiment on the yuan remains
highly sensitive to any escalation in the U.S.-China trade
conflict in the near term.
    ""We watch as Trump acts more concretely to limit investment
flows into China, pressure other nations to enact tariffs 
on China,"" the note said.
    The spot yuan opened at 7.2250 per dollar and was last
trading 7 pips firmer than the previous late session close at
7.2268 as of 0327 GMT, 0.8% weaker than the midpoint.
    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China set
the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed
to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1696 per dollar, 628 pips firmer
than a Reuters' estimate.
    Analysts at HSBC maintained their year-end forecast for the
onshore yuan against the dollar at 7.40.
    ""It is notable that the only U.S. tariffs that have not been
delayed or alleviated in some way are those imposed on China,""
HSBC analysts said in a note, adding that tariff-induced
depreciation pressure for the yuan is still high. 
    The offshore yuan traded at 7.2284 yuan per dollar, down
about 0.01% in Asian trade.
    The dollar index <=USD>, which measures the currency against
a basket of six major peers, was 0.087% higher at 103.54.

2025/3/12 3:48,《汇市短评》中国要大力提振消费，需要强势人民币,"路透3月12日 - 中国全国人大会议周二闭幕。人们仍在等待促进消费措施的细节，领导人雄心勃勃的增长目标需要这些措施的支持，而强势人民币可以在刺激花钱方面发挥作用。

    工资增长和调降所得税受到关注，而强势货币亦将提高购买力。决策者还希望改善社会保障，以缓解不确定性，释放更多可自由支配的支出。

    抑制房地产价格下跌是支持消费者情绪的另一个关键；当局承诺出台更多行业支持措施，一线希望可能会出现。同时，在全球股市下跌的情况下，中国股市的优异表现也将有所帮助。

    人民币延续周二的涨势，但主要是由于对美元的负面情绪初起。美元兑离岸人民币汇率周三跌至四个月低点，并跌穿了 200 日移动均线--这一技术信号将刺激对人民币进一步升值的押注。全国人大会议报告肯定了货币稳定的重要性。
    
    如果人民币贬值，考虑到对整体经济的影响，一向保守的中国消费者可能会有所节制。如果股市下跌，消费者也会捂紧钱包。

    中国政府似乎已经明白，需要同时保持人民币和股市坚挺；随着中国经济被迫进一步摆脱对出口的依赖，消费者信心对于中国经济来说从未像现在这样重要。

    交易员表示，美元因特朗普关税政策担忧持续疲软，欧元则受俄乌停火提议提振大涨，人民币外部环境继续改善，不过逢低购汇也会限制反弹空间。
    
    “市场情绪有点变化，有的开始看7.2，但我觉得还是要谨慎，美债可能给美元提供支撑，”一外资行交易员称。
    
    马来亚银行观点指出，英镑和欧元飙升有利于非美货币走强，目前人民币的外部环境更为温和；不过短期内人民币情绪仍然非常容易受到中美贸易冲突的影响，继续关注特朗普对中国的具体行动。
    
    
    Capital.com资深金融市场分析师Kyle Rodda说：“贸易不确定性持续存在，因此市场波动也会持续存在，”美国经济增长前景继续恶化，“这使人们更加关注美国当天晚些时候公布的消费者物价指数（CPI），这可能是市场波动的一个重要来源。”

    全球汇市方面，美元兑主要货币周三在五个月低点附近徘徊，因为在美国总统特朗普不可预测的贸易政策影响下，对美国经济的担忧持续升温。由于对乌克兰战争结束的乐观情绪升温，欧元位于五个月高点附近。[FRX/CN]

2025/3/12 2:51,BUZZ-COMMENT-China Policy Watch-Consumption push needs strong yuan,"March 12 (Reuters) - China's annual parliamentary meeting concluded on
Tuesday with little fanfare. Details of consumption-boosting measures are still
awaited to back leaders' ambitious growth targets; a strong yuan could play a
role in spurring spending.
    With wage increments and reduced income taxes eyed, a strong currency would
increase purchasing power. Policymakers are also looking to improve social
security nets, to alleviate uncertainty and unlock more discretionary spending.
    Arresting property price declines holds another key to supporting consumer
sentiment; with pledges of more sector support measures, a glimmer of hope might
appear. Meanwhile, the outperformance of Chinese stocks amid a global equity
market decline will help. 
    The yuan is adding to Tuesday's rally, though mostly due to nascent
negativity surrounding the dollar. USD/CNH slid to its lowest in four months on
Wednesday, and through its 200-day moving average - a technical cue that will
spur bets on more yuan appreciation. The National People's Congress report
affirmed the importance of a stable currency. 
    Typically conservative Chinese consumers are likely to hold back if the yuan
is seen weakening, given the implied connotations for the broader economy.  
Austerity would also follow if the stock market were to tank. 
    Beijing appears to have understood it needs to keep both the yuan and
equities buoyant; consumer confidence has never been more important for China's
economy as it is forced to pivot harder from exports reliance.

    上日人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>收报7.2306元，而中间价则为7.1741元。根据定价机制，今日中间价变动中，有565点下跌反映市场供求影响，另有18点下跌反映的是隔夜一篮子汇率基本保持不变所需要的点数；“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。

    路透测算的上日人民币兑美元中间价为7.2597元，和外汇交易中心公布的实际值偏差856点。上日路透根据CFETS公布的中间价测算，人民币汇率CFETS指数、参考SDR（特别提款权）篮子指数和参考BIS(国际清算银行)篮子指数分别为98.83、92.79和104.94。

    上日(截至北京时间次日凌晨3点)人民币兑美元即期累计成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为564.59亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

to accept a U.S. ceasefire proposal, and U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff
chaos continues to weigh on sentiment. 
    After Tuesday's Wall Street close Trump trade adviser, Peter Navarro said
50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium won't take effect Wednesday. A White
House spokesperson said the previously planned 25% tariff on steel and aluminium
will go into effect for Canada and all other U.S. trading partners at midnight.
    Wall Street and the U.S. dollar fell to new 2025 lows, while Treasury yields
and commodities bounced. 
    A negative lead for Asian markets, though EM ETFs climbed 0.83%. Japanese
PPI, Malaysian industrial output, Indian CPI and industrial output lead the
regional data schedule. U.S. tariff uncertainty will cap sentiment in Asia, the
focus will be on regional markets, ahead of U.S. CPI data, key for Federal
Reserve policy.
    Dow -1.14%, S&P -0.75%, and Nasdaq -0.18%, bouncing off early lows on
Ukraine ceasefire hopes. 
    Treasury yields recovered with the improved afternoon sentiment on Wall
Street, 2yr +5bp to 3.949%, 10yr +7bp to 4.282%, and 30yr +6bp to 4.597% on
TradeWeb. 
    The weaker U.S. dollar supported commodities, oil climbed, Brent +0.9%, WTI
+0.85%; U.S. copper jumped 2.6%; gold +0.9%, supported by tariff policy
uncertainty.
    The U.S. dollar <=USD> fell 0.5% to fresh 2025 lows, despite higher UST
yields as the euro climbed on German stimulus hopes, EUR/USD +0.75%. GBP +0.55%,
USD/CNH -0.5%, AUD +0.35%, NZD +0.25%, and USD/CAD -0.1%. USD/JPY +0.35% was the

2025/3/11 14:52,"BUZZ-FX options wrap - FX warnings, CPI risk, JPY reversal, EUR 1.15","FX option implied volatility remains close to recent and long-term highs,
signalling a clear warning against complacency in the face of potential FX
volatility shocks.
    The immediate risk stems from Wednesday's U.S. CPI data, reflected in the
sharp rise in overnight implied volatility as expiry now includes the event.
    EUR/USD is eyeing a key double top at 1.0937 (Nov 5-6), with gains above
1.0900 lifting 1-month implied volatility back to 9.0 and 1-year to 7.65. Demand
for EUR call options persists, particularly for topside strikes in call spreads
and knock-out structures, hinting at 1.1500 as a viable target in the coming
months.
    GBP/USD is still struggling to break above 1.3000, with subsequent implied
volatility setbacks having since stalled - 1-month at 8.1 from 8.6.
    AUD/USD implied volatility remains steady with 1-month in the low from mid
10's amid risk aversion and weaker levels.  
    USD/JPY implied volatility and JPY call over put premiums are just off
recent and 2025 highs amid a some profit taking on downside structures as spot
edges higher after a GPIF report. However, with stocks still falling and broader
risk sentiment strained ahead of Wednesday's US CPI data - USD/JPY implied
volatility remains well above its peers.

2025/3/11 14:15,Рубль вблизи 85 р/$ на фоне геополитического оптимизма и новостей из Курской области,"МОСКВА, 11 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль активно дорожает во
вторник и обновил на форексе в паре с долларом 7-месячный
максимум, а ключевой поддержкой для него  по-прежнему выступают
оптимистичная внешнеполитическая повестка и надежды на
ослабление американских санкций против России.
    Валютный рынок, как полагают его участники, может также в
позитивном ключе отыгрывать новости о продвижении российских
войск к границам Курской области, часть которой в начале августа
прошлого года была взята под контроль ВСУ, что привело в том
числе к ослаблению рубля.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 17.00 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,77, и российская валюта
набирает 0,9%. Ранее во вторник рубль коснулся отметки 11,72,
остановившись всего в десяти копейках от достигнутого в
позапрошлую среду максимума с июня прошлого года, 11,62.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 17.00 МСК
котировалась по 85,25, и рубль дорожает на 2,7%. Текущее
значение российской валюты - лучшее с начала августа прошлого
года.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 93,09, и
рубль здесь дорожает почти на два процента.
    ""Идет активная покупка рубля, поскольку есть ощущения, что
уже есть какие-то договоренности - на это может указывать
текущая ситуации в Курской области в пользу РФ и одновременно
снижение активности РФ по другим линиям вооруженного
соприкосновения, чем сейчас полна новостная лента"", - сказал на
условиях анонимности дилер крупного российского банка, по мнению
которого рубль скоро должен достичь краткосрочных равновесных
уровней.
    ""Поддержку российская валюта нашла в новом витке позитивных
геополитических новостей"", - отмечают аналитики банка
Санкт-Петербург.
    В частности, спецпосланник американского президента Дональда
Трампа Стив Уиткофф планирует посетить Москву в ближайшие дни
для встречи с президентом России Владимиром Путиным, а в
Саудовской Аравии сегодня проходили переговоры США и Украины,
при этом Кремль рассчитывает, что Штаты проинформируют РФ об их
итогах.
    ""Умеренно-позитивное развитие геополитической ситуации в
последнее время увеличивают шансы на более устойчивое укрепление
рубля"", - говорится в аналитическом обзоре Райффайзенбанка.
    Аналитики банка сохраняют консерватизм в оценках рубля,
""поскольку вряд ли существенных результатов в переговорах
удастся добиться быстро, а фундаментальная поддержка рубля в
этом году по мере сокращения торгового баланса будет
ослабевать"".
    На стороне рубля сейчас также выступает высокая ключевая
ставка ЦБР, охлаждающая внутренний потребительский спрос, что в
том числе приводит к сокращению покупок инвалюты импортерами. В
пользу рубля - валютные интервенции Центробанка, который сейчас
продает китайские юани почти на 6 миллиардов рублей в день.
    На таком фоне с начала текущего года доллар против рубля
потерял на форексе 25%, евро - 21%, юань дешевеет в биржевой
паре с рублем за этот же период на 14%.
    Набор текущих факторов поддержки позволяет рублю не обращать
внимания на нездоровое состояние нефтяного рынка.
    За неполные два месяца североморская смесь потеряла в цене
почти 15%, и такая динамика нефти является существенным риском
для рубля вкупе с последствиями западных санкций в отношении
российской ""нефтянки"" и танкерного флота РФ.
    Сегодня нефть дорожает, оставаясь, тем не менее, в
непосредственной близости от более чем трехлетних минимумов.
Баррель Brent <LCOc1> растет на 1,6% и оценивается в $70,23, а
на прошлой неделе он стоил $68,33 впервые с декабря 2021 года.

были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,77, и российская валюта
набирает 0,9%, ранее коснувшись отметки 11,72, что всего в
десяти копейках от максимума с прошлого июня.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 15.40 МСК
котировалась по 85,49, и рубль дорожает на 2,4%. Текущее
значение всего в 12 копейках от пикового значения рубля с начала
августа прошлого года.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 93,30, и
рубль здесь дорожает на 1,7%, ранее достигнув недельного
максимума 93,11.
    ""Идет активная покупка рубля, поскольку есть ощущения, что
уже есть какие-то договоренности - на это может указывать
текущая ситуации в Курской области в пользу РФ и одновременно
снижение активности РФ по другим линиям вооруженного
соприкосновения, чем сейчас полна новостная лента"", - сказал на
условиях анонимности дилер крупного российского банка, по мнению
которого рубль скоро должен достичь краткосрочных равновесных
уровней.
    ""Поддержку российская валюта нашла в новом витке позитивных
геополитических новостей"", - отмечают аналитики банка
Санкт-Петербург.
    В частности, спецпосланник американского президента Дональда
Трампа Стив Уиткофф планирует посетить Москву в ближайшие дни,
чтобы провести встречу с президентом России Владимиром Путиным,
а в Саудовской Аравии сегодня проходят переговоры США и Украины.
    ""Умеренно-позитивное развитие геополитической ситуации в
последнее время увеличивают шансы на более устойчивое укрепление
рубля"", - говорится в аналитическом обзоре Райффайзенбанка.
    Аналитики банка при этом сохраняют консерватизм в оценках
рубля, ""поскольку вряд ли существенных результатов в переговорах
удастся добиться быстро, а фундаментальная поддержка рубля в
этом году по мере сокращения торгового баланса будет
ослабевать"".
    На стороне рубля сейчас также выступает высокая ключевая
ставка ЦБР, охлаждающая внутренний потребительский спрос, что в
том числе приводит к сокращению покупок инвалюты импортерами. В
пользу рубля - валютные интервенции Центробанка, который сейчас
продает китайские юани почти на 6 миллиардов рублей в день.
    На таком фоне с начала текущего года доллар против рубля
потерял на форексе 24%, евро - 20%, юань дешевеет в биржевой
паре с рублем за этот же период на 14%, а в прошлом месяце
ключевые валюты достигли против российской минимальных значений
с прошлого лета: 85,37 рубля за доллар, 89,63 за евро и 12,63 за
юань.
    Набор текущих факторов поддержки позволяет рублю не обращать
внимания на нездоровое состояние нефтяного рынка.
    За неполные два месяца североморская смесь потеряла в цене
15%, и такая динамика нефти является существенным риском для
рубля вкупе с последствиями западных санкций в отношении
российской ""нефтянки"" и танкерного флота РФ.
    Сегодня нефть дорожает, оставаясь, тем не менее, в
непосредственной близости от более чем трехлетних минимумов.
Баррель Brent <LCOc1> растет на 1,2% и оценивается в $70,02, а
на прошлой неделе он стоил $68,33 впервые с декабря 2021 года.

2025/3/11 10:17,BUZZ-COMMENT-U.S. CPI risk to FX according to FX options,"March 11 (Reuters) - Volatility is a crucial yet unpredictable factor in
FX option pricing, which is why dealers rely on implied volatility as a
substitute. Overnight expiry implied volatility now reflects Wednesday's U.S.
CPI data, offering insight into the market's expectations for the realized
volatility the release may trigger.
    FX option implied volatility is already elevated across all G10 major
currency pairs and maturities, driven by a broad-based USD decline and
heightened risk aversion since mid to late February.  Overnight expiry implied
volatility reached its highest levels for 2025 before Friday's U.S. jobs data to
highlight a market worried that a weak data print could fuel a deeper USD
decline.
    Overnight EUR/USD implied volatility has climbed from 13.0 to 15.0 since
incorporating the CPI risk, translating to a premium - or breakeven point - of
68 USD pips in either direction. While this is only a modest gain, implied
volatility was already elevated compared to the late February average of 9.0 (41
USD pips).
    AUD/USD overnight implied volatility has risen from 10.0 to 12.0 with the
CPI inclusion, implying a 31 USD pip breakeven, a limited increase but notably
higher than its February average of 8.0 (21 USD pips).
    USD/JPY overnight implied volatility stands out given its stronger
correlation with risk sentiment. It has risen 2.0, but reached a peak of 21.0,
implying a 130 JPY pip breakeven in either direction. This is just shy of the
2025 high of 22.0 seen ahead of last Friday's U.S. jobs data.

2025/3/11 8:46,"Asia markets in red tracking Wall Street losses amid tariff worries, recession fears","Asia markets in red tracking Wall Street losses amid tariff worries, recession fearsAsia-Pacific markets in red on Tuesday following a downbeat session on Wall Street overnight, amid relentless tariff wrangling and concerns over a potential economic recession.

Japan (NKY:IND) fell 0.78% to below 36,200, while the broader Topix Index dropped 2.9% to 2,620 on Tuesday, reaching their lowest levels in at least five months as sentiment was further dampened by revised fourth-quarter GDP data. The Japanese yen strengthened to around 147 per dollar on Tuesday, reaching its highest level in five months.

In Japan, sentiment was further dampened as Q4 GDP growth was revised lower, with annualized expansion slowing to 2.2% from a previous estimate of 2.8%, as private consumption stalled.

Household spending in Japan increased by 0.8% year-on-year in January 2024, slowing from a 27% rise in the previous month and missing market forecasts of 3.6% as the impact of winter bonuses subsided.

China (SHCOMP) fell 0.32% to around 3,350, while the Shenzhen Component lost 0.3% to 10,790 on Tuesday, marking the third consecutive session of declines, and the offshore yuan strengthened to around 7.24 per dollar, erasing losses from the previous session.

In China, the government plans to increase fiscal stimulus to boost growth, raising its fiscal deficit target to 4% of GDP and issuing ?1.3 trillion in ultra-long-term bonds for 2025, ?300 billion more than last year.

Separately, the US is set to probe China-manufactured chip models used in consumer electronics, potentially leading to additional tariffs on Chinese products.

Meanwhile, China's Two Sessions will conclude later today, with some traders anticipating new measures to boost the sluggish economy.

Hong Kong (HSI) fell 0.81% to 23,616 in early trade on Tuesday, marking the second session of losses as most sectors dipped, notably financials, property, and consumers.

India (SENSEX) fell 0.26% to 73,892, retreating for the eighth straight day, tracking a decline in its Asian market peers.

Capping the fall was a Reuters poll showing that the Indian February inflation rate is expected to ease below the RBI's medium-term target of 4% for the first time in six months due to moderating food prices, which fueled expectations of interest rate cuts.

Australia (AS51) fell 0.91% to close at 7,890 on Tuesday, reaching its lowest level in seven months. The Australian dollar hovered around $0.627 on Tuesday after three consecutive sessions of declines, pressured by broad risk aversion across financial markets amid rising US recession fears.

Domestically, investors assessed data showing Australian consumer sentiment surged to a three-year high in March, supported by the Reserve Bank of Australia's interest rate cut in February and easing cost-of-living pressures. However, business confidence turned negative in February, highlighting ongoing economic challenges.

In the U.S., on Monday, all three major indexes ended in red as investors grew increasingly concerned about tariff uncertainty and its potential to trigger a recession.

U.S. stock futures moderately up Tuesday as growing recession concerns fueled a sharp selloff at the start of the week: Dow +0.29%; S&P 500 +0.22%; Nasdaq +0.10%.

Investors now look forward to the U.S. inflation data later this week that could influence the Fed's monetary policy stance.

Currencies: (JPY:USD), (CNY:USD), (AUD:USD), (INR:USD), (HKD:USD), (NZD:USD).

More on Asia:

 * 
 * China's CPI fell for first time in 13 months, PPI deflation persists
 * China's trade surplus surpass forecasts, exports grow by 2.3% and imports shrink
 * Australia's trade balance exceeds expectations, export growth accelerates and imports decline
 * Australia's economy grows by 0.6% in Q4, surpasses expectations
 * Japan's services sector grows at fastest pace in six months, driven by strong demand

Japan Q4 GDP growth revised slightly lower; annualized basis economy expands by 2.2%

2025/3/11 8:35,"Рубль немного дешевеет на Мосбирже, продолжая набирать вес на форексе","МОСКВА, 11 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль во вторник немного
дешевеет на Мосбирже, поскольку участники локального рынка
осторожничают после сообщений о массированной атаке бесилотников
на московский регион, но одновременно российская валюта растет
на форексе с учетом преимущественно позитивной
внешнеполитической новостной повестки.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 11.25 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,91, и российская валюта
теряет 0,3%. В начале же торгов рубль сумел коснуться отметки
11,84, лучшего значения за почти две недели.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к 11.25 МСК
котировались вблизи отметок 11,92, 87,60 и 95,10 соответственно,
и рубль теряет 0,3% к юаню, 0,1% к доллару и 0,5% к евро.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 11.25 МСК
котировалась по 86,80, и рубль дорожает на 0,9%, ранее
отметившись на 86,70 впервые с 27 февраля.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 94,58, и
рубль здесь дорожает на 0,4%.
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 12,05, что совпадает с последними вчерашними
котировками.
    ""Поддержку российская валюта нашла в новом витке позитивных
геополитических новостей"", - отмечают аналитики банка
Санкт-Петербург.
    В частности, спецпосланник американского президента Дональда
Трампа Стив Уиткофф планирует посетить Москву в ближайшие дни,
чтобы провести встречу с президентом России Владимиром Путиным,
а в Саудовской Аравии скоро должны начаться переговоры США и
Украины.
    На стороне рубля сейчас также выступает высокая ключевая
ставка ЦБР, охлаждающая внутренний потребительский спрос, что в
том числе приводит к сокращению покупок инвалюты импортерами. В
пользу рубля - валютные интервенции Центробанка, который сейчас
продает китайские юани почти на 6 миллиардов рублей в день.
    На таком фоне с начала текущего года доллар против рубля
потерял на форексе 23%, евро - 19%, юань дешевеет в биржевой
паре с рублем за этот же период на 13%, а в прошлом месяце
ключевые валюты достигли против российской минимальных значений
с прошлого лета: 85,37 рубля за доллар, 89,63 за евро и 12,63 за
юань. 
    Центробанк объяснил подобную динамику российской валюты
ростом объемов чистых продаж иностранной валюты экспортерами и
сокращением импорта, помимо снижения геополитической
напряженности.
    Набор текущих факторов поддержки позволяет рублю не обращать
внимания на нездоровое состояние нефтяного рынка.
    За неполные два месяца североморская смесь потеряла в цене
более 15%, и такая динамика нефти является существенным риском
для рубля вкупе с последствиями западных санкций в отношении
российской ""нефтянки"" и танкерного флота РФ.
    Сегодня нефть котируется в плюсе, оставаясь недалеко от
более чем трехлетних минимумов. Баррель Brent <LCOc1> дорожает
на 0,6% и оценивается в $69,57, а на прошлой неделе он стоил
$68,33 впервые с декабря 2021 года.

2025/3/11 7:31,Юань восстанавливается на фоне слабости доллара,"ГОНКОНГ, 11 мар (Рейтер) - Юань идет вверх во вторник
после трех сессий снижения - инвесторы сократили длинные позиции
в долларе на фоне опасений о рецессии в США, что оказало
поддержку китайской и другим азиатским валютам.
    Инвесторы, избегающие риска, во вторник активно покупали
японскую иену из-за опасений по поводу замедления роста
американской экономики на фоне политики администрации президента
США Дональда Трампа в области пошлин. Аналитики также сказали о
примечательном отсутствие спроса на доллар, который отступал в
последние недели.
    Это также ослабило давление на юань, на котором до сих пор
сказывались тревоги о торговых войнах и проблемах во внутренней
экономике, что позволило центральному банку Китая несколько
снизить поддержку валюте в виде официального фиксинга.
    Перед открытием сессии ЦБ Китая объявил срединный
фиксированный курс <CNY=PBOC> на уровне 7,1741 за доллар - самом
слабом уровне более чем за неделю. При этом значение оказалось
на 856 pips (десятитысячных долей процентного пункта) сильнее
приведенного Рейтер прогноза аналитиков.

максимума пяти месяцев во вторник, став самым популярным среди
инвесторов активом-убежищем, поскольку опасения о замедлении
роста экономики США из-за пошлин привели к падению американских
акций и доллара.

тревог находятся экономика и фондовый рынок США, это
ограничивает привлекательность доллара"", - сказал Крис Уэстон из
Pepperstone.
    Потрясения на фондовом рынке, похоже, были вызваны интервью
Дональда Трампа телеканалу Fox News, где президент говорил о
переходном периоде и отказался предсказать, приведут ли его
тарифы в отношении Китая, Канады и Мексики к рецессии в США.
    ""Рынок не уверен по поводу того, продолжит ли ослабление
исключительности Соединенных Штатов давить на доллар или же
валюта получит поддержку благодаря своему статусу защитного
актива"", - сказал Сим Мох Сионг из Bank of Singapore, отметив,

2025/3/11 6:46,Рубль на тихом утреннем рынке обновил в паре с долларом максимум марта,"МОСКВА, 11 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль утром вторника
показывает достаточно скромную смешанную динамику на форексе
после значительного роста накануне, но при этом он сумел
обновить мартовский максимум в паре с долларом. 
    Участники рынка могут воздерживаться от активных действий
после сообщений о массированной атаке бесилотников на московский
регион, но одновременно они продолжают следить за
геополитической новостной повесткой, которая в целом остается
оптимистичной и держит российскую валюту в тонусе.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 9.30 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 87,00, что является лучшим значением для рубля с 27 февраля.
Российская валюта набирает четверть процента от уровней закрытия
понедельника, по итогам которого она укрепилась на 2,6%.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется по 95,24, и рубль
теряет треть процента от закрытия понедельника, по итогам
которого российская валюта подорожала на 2,6%. 
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 12,19, что совпадает с последними вчерашними
показателями LSEG.
    Вчерашние же торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами
""завтра"" завершились на уровне 11,88 рубля за юань - российская
валюта в итоге укрепилась на 2,1% при объеме сделок в 98
миллиардов рублей, вечером отметившись на максимуме текущего
месяца, отметке 11,87.
    Основной поддержкой продолжал выступать рыночный оптимизм в
отношении геополитических перспектив для России, игнорирующий
достаточно волатильную текущую новостную повестку и нездоровое
состояние нефтяного рынка.
    ""Если в текущем месяце получат практическое воплощение
мирные инициативы со стороны РФ и Украины или состоится встреча
президентов России и США с какими-либо позитивными реальными
последствиями, рубль может продолжить среднесрочное движение в
сторону 80 за доллар"", - полагает Наталья Мильчакова из компании
Freedom Finance Global. 
    Она при этом предупреждает, что если попытки Москвы и
Вашингтона наладить отношения не получат развития и Белый дом
реализует угрозу ужесточения санкций, то доллар вернется в
диапазон 90C93 рубля. 
    На стороне рубля сейчас выступает высокая ключевая ставка
ЦБР, охлаждающая внутренний потребительский спрос, что в том
числе приводит к сокращению покупок инвалюты импортерами. В
пользу рубля - валютные интервенции Центробанка, который сейчас
продает китайские юани почти на 6 миллиардов рублей в день.
    На таком фоне с начала текущего года доллар против рубля
потерял на форексе 23%, евро - 19%, юань дешевеет в биржевой
паре с рублем за этот же период на 13%, а в прошлом месяце
ключевые валюты достигли против российской минимальных значений
с прошлого лета: 85,37 рубля за доллар, 89,63 за евро и 12,63 за
юань. 
    Центробанк объяснил подобную динамику российской валюты
ростом объемов чистых продаж иностранной валюты экспортерами и
сокращением импорта, помимо снижения геополитической
напряженности.
    Тем временем, на внешних рынках нефть котируется в небольшом
плюсе вблизи более чем трехлетних минимумов. Баррель Brent
<LCOc1> дорожает на четверть процента и оценивается в $69,30, а
на прошлой неделе он стоил $68,33 впервые с декабря 2021 года.
    За неполные два месяца североморская смесь потеряла в цене
более 15%, и такая динамика нефти является существенным риском
для рубля вкупе с последствиями западных санкций в отношении
российской ""нефтянки"" и танкерного флота РФ, однако и здесь
может перевешивать навес ожиданий, что Вашингтон в перспективе
пойдет на смягчение своих рестрикций против Москвы в этой сфере,
о чем в последнее время появились сообщения в СМИ.

2025/3/11 5:10,China's yuan rebounds as US dollar takes a hit,"By Summer Zhen
       HONG KONG, March 11 (Reuters) - China's yuan
strengthened against the dollar on Tuesday after three straight
sessions of losses, as investors trimmed their dollar long
positions amid U.S. recession fears, supporting the yuan and
other Asian currencies.
    Risk-off global investors piled into the Japanese yen on
Tuesday amid fears about a tariff-driven slowdown in U.S.
growth. Analysts also noted the lack of flight to the dollar
even as it has been sinking in recent weeks as noteworthy.
    That also eased pressure on the yuan which had been battling
with tariff and domestic economy concerns, allowing China's
central bank to scale down some support on daily fixed rate
guidance. 
    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China set
the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed
to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1741 per dollar, its weakest level
in over a week and 856 pips firmer than a Reuters estimate.
    By 0436 GMT, the yuan <CNY=CFXS> was 0.2% higher at 7.2450
to the dollar after trading in a range of 7.2426 to 7.2608.
    ""Since Trump's inauguration, the materializing U.S. tariff
hikes have continued to keep the RMB on the back foot,"" Ken
Cheung, chief Asia FX strategist at Mizuho Bank, said in a note.
    ""But the recent USD decline gave the PBOC a sigh of relief
in preserving FX stability,"" he added. 
    Some analysts believed the recent breakthroughs in
artificial intelligence from DeepSeek to Manus also served as a
catalyst, but the question is how long the optimism can last. 
    The key question over the dollar versus the yuan is whether
developments in Chinese technology can challenge U.S.
exceptionalism and the dollar's high valuation, and if this is
able to resolve the binding constraints plaguing the Chinese
economy, Michael Wan, senior currency analyst at MUFG, wrote in
a note. 
    Meanwhile, DBS analysts noted that the steady yuan exchange
rates also opened the window for liquidity injection.
    The offshore yuan traded at 7.2448 yuan per dollar <CNH=>,
up about 0.28% in Asian trade.

       路透北京3月11日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周二早盘反弹逾200点，离岸CNH<CNH=D3>也阶段性强于在岸汇价；中间价则小跌至逾一周新低，但与路透预测偏离水平扩至近860点，表明在中国“两会”结束前监管仍有较强维稳意愿。
    
    交易员表示，特朗普关税政策引发衰退担忧加剧，隔夜美债收益率急挫且美股大跌，而人民币中间价依然强势，同时中国股市也展现韧性，均助力人民币市场情绪。
    
    “美股大跌，后面美元可能还有调整空间，这周通胀数据很关键了，”一外资行交易员称。
    
    马来亚银行观点指出，近期离岸CNH与在岸汇价接近平价，表明人民币贬压不大；而且在美元疲软的背景下，后续中国央行有机会在不冒太大波动风险的情况下放松中间价。
    
    国泰君安国际宏观团队报告认为，短期特朗普的政策重心将转回美国国内。这似乎也意味着，遏制通胀是所有政策的最终目的之一，即将公布的2月通胀数据将暗示本轮市场调整的长度，如果通胀仍然处于高位，那么股票市场的信心可能将再受打击。
    
    本周的主要经济焦点将是周三的美国2月消费者物价通胀数据，生产者物价数据定于周四公布。
    
    
    纽约联邦储备银行周一发布的一份报告称，尽管美国人对未来通胀路径的预期变化不大，但他们在2月对经济前景的担忧却有所增加。

    美国总统特朗普一位重要经济顾问周一反驳因政府关税政策不确定性而导致经济衰退的说法，即使一项针对美国家庭的调查显示，消费者对前景的悲观情绪正在升高，且美国股市大幅下挫。
    
    根据伦敦证券交易所集团（LSEG）汇编的数据，目前交易商预计美联储今年将有近三次降息，每次25个基点。
    
    北京时间11:03，人民币兑美元即期报7.244元，上日收报7.2649元，夜盘终报7.2595元。今日人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>报7.1741元，上日为7.1733元。截至目前人民币即期成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为192.56亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

2025/3/11 0:00,Offshore Yuan Rises on Weaker Dollar,"Offshore Yuan Rises on Weaker DollarThe offshore yuan strengthened to around 7.24 per dollar, erasing losses from the previous session as the greenback weakened amid mounting fears of a tariff-driven US recession. Investor concerns deepened after US President Trump described a 'period of transition' while avoiding predictions on whether his tariffs could trigger a recession. In China, the government plans to increase fiscal stimulus to boost growth, raising its fiscal deficit target to 4% of GDP and issuing ?1.3 trillion in ultra-long-term bonds for 2025, ?300 billion more than last year. On the monetary policy front, traders dialed back expectations for imminent rate cuts after PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng reiterated that easing would occur 'at an appropriate time.' Investors are now focused on key policy announcements following the conclusion of the Two Sessions annual meetings."

Original Press Release:

March 10 -- Bank of China issued the following news release:

The 14th National People's Congress and the 14 th National Assembly were opened in Beijing on March 4 and March 5, respectively. The Bank of China's representatives from Hong Kong and Macau at the National Summits of the Bank have studied the spirit of key speeches during the two National Conferences of General Secretary Xi Jinping and the government work report by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, focusing on the key work of accelerating the construction of Macao Bay Area in Port Harcourt, promoting the building of Hong kong International Financial Center, and promotes the adequate diversification of development in Macaou, around how the Chinese Bank can rely on globalization advantages, integrated features to contribute greater financial strength in the new journey of building a strong country, discussing opinions, exchanging views, fulfilling the duty to participate actively in politics and advise. The National People's Congress delegate, the independent director of the Bank of China, Mr. Yang Shiping, delivered an important speech during the visit of President Xi Jinping to Macau, fully acknowledging the great achievements of Macao' s 25 years of great history and achievement, and pointing out the direction of integration of Hong Kong into China' S modernization and better development.

The new government will be the first to take the country's pearl of great price and make it even more impressive. To this end, I have four suggestions for this year's two national meetings: first, to write a book on the two systems of one country and one state in multiple languages, further tell the story of the one-country and two-systems of government, and show the advantages of both systems; second, the comprehensive service economy is an important task, considering the top-level institutional arrangements and governance capabilities of special regions; third, focus on making good use of capital and the benefits of two, accelerate the development of Macau integration; fourth, promote the construction of a Macao science and technology hub, improve the international image of Special Regions, enhance the global service capability, especially the European Union and Latin-language countries. The president of the country, who is not a member of parliament, has been arrested.

Bank of China plays an important role in supporting the moderate and diversified development of Macau's economy, especially in the financial sector. The Bank of China's efforts to facilitate cross-border capital flows and digital management in the Greater Bay Area are one of the key areas of its efforts in developing financial services and promoting the construction of a deep cooperation zone between the Yukon and the Australian Capital Territory. We hope that the Bank of China will further strengthen its cooperation with the Macao SAR government, assist Macau in issuing various types of bonds, support Macaou in building a Chinese-Portuguese national financial services platform, promote the construction of Macauo as a Portuguese-speaking national yuan clearing center, and make a greater contribution to the development of special financial service in Macauu.

The year 2025 is the year of the end of Xi's 14th Five-Year Plan and an important year for deepening reforms. As a representative of the Hong Kong financial community, I focused on the development of financial sector, the construction of HongKong and the Greater Bay Area, and made recommendations, including further facilitating cross-border financing, continuous optimization of cross border financial management and flow mechanism, promoting small payments interconnection between Hong kong and mainland enterprises, etc. In addition, I spoke at the Hong Kong delegation's plenary session and proposed targeted policies such as tax incentives and encouraging financial institutions to increase their support for private enterprises.

At the same time, financial institutions should develop products and services that are appropriate to the characteristics and development of private enterprises, including innovative services such as intellectual property collateral financing, supply chain, and accounts receivable collating finances. Bank of China has a lot of work to do in consolidating and developing Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and in accelerating the process of integrating HongKong into the Bay Area. The first is to further strengthen Hong Kong's position as the only offshore RMB clearing house in HongKong.

The second is to promote the interconnection of financial markets in the Greater Bay Area by relying on the financial services network. The third is to leverage the strength of the professional talent pool to promote the development of financial technology in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area. The National People's Congress, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of DaFong Bank, Supervisor of Bank of China Macau, Mr. Jun Yong-un, and I presented eight recommendations at the meeting, including promoting the development of integrated development in Chinatown, promotes the growth of medical technology industry in Macao, supporting the green transition to achieve a circular economy, promote the construction of a talent coordination system in the Gulf region, strengthen the protection of women and children, etc.

The purpose is to work to play the advantage of both national and regional institutions, further promote China and Macaou' s institutional mechanisms. To use the combined strengths of the Greater Macao Bay Area to continuously improve social security capacity and continue to promote Macau's long-term prosperity and stable development. In the process of advancing the integration of Chinatown, through optimizing the convenience of the Chintown tourism group to visit the mission, improving China-Australia cooperation in the policy of China's medical technology industry, and increasing the cooperation of Chinese-Australian related to Chinhown medical + tourist, promoting the highly synergistic and efficient cross-border movement of elements of both Chinchown and Chin-Aussian economies.

In the development of green economy, through the comprehensive balance of the implementation of fiscal, financial, investment and other policies and standards system, to continue to promote the green industry development, accelerate the construction of a green low-carbon circular economy development system to achieve economic and social development comprehending green transition. In the area of protection of the rights of women and children, to respond to the challenges of an ageing population and to promote sustainable and high-quality development of society through measures such as increased policy incentives and financial support, optimization of public employment services and strengthening of minors' protection. In the context of the moderate and diversified development of Macau's economy, the representative of CBO expressed the hope that the Bank of China will rely on the advantages of its channel network in Macao, Hong Kong, to fully promote the integration of Hong-Kong and Macai, and promote efficient development and coordination of regional economies.

The Bank of China has a well-established green finance development system that can integrate resources in Macau, strengthen the innovation and promotion of green credit, green bonds, and green insurance, as well as the promotion and development of a green, low-carbon, circular economy system to support the development and growth of Macao's green economy. The National People's Congress delegation, the Director of the Bank of Japan, Ho Jing-Chiang, and the delegates at the two meetings, looked at Macau' s achievements in the field of stable development after its return to the motherland, which demonstrated the significant institutional advantages and strong vitality of Macao' S.E.C. At this meeting, I put forward eight recommendations, including the application of insider trading laws, offshore green electricity direct supply, development of Chinese pharmaceutical industry, transportation integration, trade in Chinese and Portuguese agricultural products, mutual recognition of social security, reform of the inspection and quarantine system and exchange of sports talents, in order to further promote Macau's integration into the national development landscape, to use Macao' s unique advantages under the one-country two-system system, explore more replicable and disseminated system innovation experience, further deepen Macaou cooperation, and contribute to the high-quality development in the Macaau Bay Area.

The president of the country, who is not a member of parliament, has been arrested. Bank of China is the most globalised and integrated Chinese-owned bank with a well-developed global service network. The aim of the meeting is to promote the moderate and diversified development of Macau's economy, and to encourage Chinese banks to make full use of their resource and channel advantages, to innovate in order to foster the integration of financial products and channels between Macao and China, promoting the further free flow of elements between the two countries; to strengthen cooperation between Portuguese-speaking countries through the strength of connecting Macaou with the Portugueses, boosting the Chinese-Portuguese economy; and promotes the development and use the digital currency to create more convenient financial services for Macauan residents.

Member of the National Council of State, Independent Director of Bank of China Yang Zhangjiang This year I submitted two personal proposals, one on accelerating the development of our country's offshore trade and the other on promoting cross-border tourism consumption in the Greater Bay Area. In addition, this year's Government Work Report calls for greater efforts to stabilize and expand employment. At the meeting of the Political Affairs Council, I suggested that we promote employment through high-quality development, better play the positive role of digital economy in stable employment and other aspects, and cultivate new growth points of employment; We should pay attention to the construction of applied universities, strengthen the alignment of higher education with market demand, improve the competitiveness of students' employment.

In the context of promoting the construction of the Greater Bay Area in Hong Kong, I propose that institutional and policy innovation can support Hong kong in creating a hub for international high-level talent, and fully leverage the enthusiasm of top trauma science talents, so as to promote the country's high level of technological self-reliance in the near future. The Commissioner spoke to the Central Bank of China, expressing hope that the Bank will further rely on the advantages of globalization, play a good role as the main channel bank for cross-border financial services, continue to explore product and service system innovation, actively support the promotion of the internationalization of RMB, and provide greater financial resources to support offshore trade development. To further promote the facilitation of cross-border payments, explore more cross border payment scenarios, promote cross cross country movement and consumption of residents of the Greater Bay Area, and further support the development of special tourism industry.

Continuously strengthen the capacity of technology and financial services, strengthen cooperation with all sectors of society, including businesses and universities, to help Hong Kong build a high-end international talent pool, and self-inject financial dynamism to achieve high level of technological independence. The Government Work Report this year for the first time proposes to support the deepening of international engagement and cooperation between Hong Kong and Macau. The high degree of openness is a fundamental characteristic of a financial powerhouse, and internationalization is the most valuable function of the Hong Kong International Financial Centre.

At two national meetings, I suggested that Hong Kong should strengthen the regional radiation of offshore RMB business, promote monetary cooperation with Southeast Asia, the Middle East and other countries; enhance the capacity of RMC investment financing, increase the use and willingness of international companies and investors to invest in offshore yuan; focus on the development of markets in ASEAN and the middle East, open new markets and new sources of funds, and connect the mainland and developed markets such as Europe and America with the role of super-contact and super value-added currency, further expanding to the emerging markets of the global South. The government also suggested that the country continue to promote the deepening and expansion of the Internet, so that Hong Kong can play a greater role in the process of opening and developing the national financial market. The Commissioner spoke about the Central Bank of Hong Kong's commitment to implementing the requirements set out in the Government' s Work Report for this year in terms of expanding domestic demand, developing new quality productive capacity in geographical terms, expanded high-level opening-up, and regional coordinated development, to meet the needs of the country, as directed by the Hong kong government.

The first is to support the construction of the Hong Kong International Financial Centre, to strengthen the private banking, asset management and financial markets business centre of CBDC HongKong, and to accelerate the creation of a global custody network with CBCD Hong-KONG as its hub.

to provide high quality financial support for the coordinated development of the Greater Bay area. He Qiansheng, member of the National Council of Political Consultants, Business Advisor of Bank of China Macau Branch The Commissioner looks forward to the two meetings. With the strong support of the Central Government and the joint efforts of Macau and Macao, the Yokan, Macaou Deep Cooperation Zone has successfully completed the first phase of its mission and delivered a brilliant report.

This year is the key year for the completion of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the planning of its outline. The integration of Chin and Macau will enter a new phase and a further stage. At the two national meetings this year, I brought a number of suggestions to facilitate cross-border life for Macau residents and to deepen the development of Macao's cultural and social cohesion.

I and other members of the committee, relying on the strengths of each sector, jointly put forward targeted opinions on various aspects such as building a strong education, complementing the advantages of ports, and the Sino-Portuguese economic and trade platform, submitted proposals on improving cross-border public transport and related regulatory mechanisms, developing cultural and industrial highlands with Chinatown characteristics, etc., and focused on further utilizing Macau + Chintown's advances, strengthening international cooperation in the development of Chinese medicine and health industry. The Bank of China Macao Moole Bank should shoulder the responsibility and responsibility to support the long-term prosperity of Macau's economic society, build on the one center, one platform, and one base, will promote the development of the appropriate diversification of macau economy, promote Macaou' s unique advantage of location, as well as serve Macauo to accelerate integration into the construction of a large bay area as a priority task, especially to take the initiative as the architect of modern financial infrastructure of good Macaoo, to provide comprehensive and high-quality financial services for migrants and immigrants, in the continuous expansion of broad cross-border financial channels in Macauu, actively promote cross border financial livelihood facilitation and other areas to strengthen exploration, continuously improve the capacity and level of financial service. The National Political Bureau member, Vice President of the Macao Branch of Bank of China, and Supervisor of Macau Branche of Chinese Bank, Mr. Ye Zhijia, Member of Parliament, attended the two meetings.

Macaou as one of central cities of Hong Kong Macai Bay Area, an important pillar of a road linking the Bay of Bengal, the forefront of cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries, will firmly implement the spirit of important speeches such as the Four-Point Hope and Three-point Consent, which were presented by President Xi Jinping during his visit to Macauo, focusing on the vision of building four Macauan ports, connectivity and innovation in the Gulf region, further play the unique advantages of connecting the world, high level of financial empowerment and openness to the outside, enhance the role of Macan as a platform for bilateral exchange in domestic and international transactions.

In the future, Bank of China will continue to play an active role in financial empowerment and service to the global community in the moderate and diversified development of Macau's economy, the integration of the Macao Bay Area in Hong Kong and the construction of a deep cooperation zone between Yokohama and Macaou.

2025/3/10 14:59,BUZZ-FX options wrap - FX consolidation now evident in premium,"FX option implied volatility was boosted by recent JPY and EUR gains and the
broad USD decline. Post-U.S. jobs data price action shows a market still wary of
further directional trading and FX volatility, but also cautious about spending
too much premium, while spot markets risk some near-term consolidation. 
    Sub one-month expiry implied volatility has eased from last week's highs
across most currency pairs, though it remains elevated compared to pre-rally
levels. In EUR/USD, the recently acquired topside strike premium has also
retreated in sub three-month expiry risk reversal contracts. The benchmark
one-month 25-delta risk reversal shifted from 0.6 EUR puts to 0.6 EUR calls ―
marking its highest topside strike premium since 2022 ― before easing back to
0.1 EUR calls on Monday. However, traders have not called time on more EUR/USD
gains.  
    USD/JPY implied volatility and JPY call risk reversal premiums are holding
up better, with the one-month 25 delta contract at 2025 highs of 1.8 for
downside versus upside strikes. This comes amid ongoing demand for outright JPY
calls as the market edges closer to 145.00 option barriers. 
    Elsewhere - GBP/USD remains focused on owning strikes above 1.3000 but
implied volatility has eased as spot progress stalls for now. Benchmark
one-month expiry is back at 8.1 from 8.6 last week. EUR/GBP is also buying
topside strikes and implied volatility setbacks are more shallow, as EUR
outperforms GBP.
     AUD/USD has regained more familiar ranges around 0.6300 after its slide to
0.6185 last week, which takes one-month implied volatility back to 10.2 from
highs since early February at 10.5. 
    The near-term focus for markets is Wednesday's U.S. CPI data, with the
extent of the related FX volatility risk premium to be reflected through
overnight expiry option implied volatility from Tuesday.

повсеместный рост, а основной поддержкой продолжает оставаться
""железный"" рыночный оптимизм в отношении геополитических
перспектив для России, игнорирующий достаточно волатильную
текущую новостную повестку и нездоровое состояние текущего
нефтяного рынка.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 17.40 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,95, и российская валюта
набирает 1,5%, Текущие уровни - лучшие для рубля с 27 февраля.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 17.40 МСК
котировалась по 87,87, и рубль дорожает на 2,4%, ранее достигнув
отметки 87,70 впервые с 28 февраля. 
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 95,21, и
рубль здесь дорожает на 2,3%.
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 12,19, и российская валюта набирает 0,3%, ранее
отметившись на недельном пике 12,05.
    ""В фокусе остается геополитика, поскольку при появлении
позитивных сигналов рубль может игнорировать
прочие раздражители"", - считает Владимир Евстифеев из банка
Зенит.
    ""Позитивная динамика обусловлена ожиданием мирных
переговоров по Украине и надеждами на смягчение антироссийских
санкций"", - полагает Владимир Чернов из компании
Freedom Finance Global.
    По мнению Алексея Антонова из компании Алор Брокер, любой
позитив по переговорам России и США приведет к мощному
укреплению рубля.
    Невзирая на переменчивую риторику нынешнего главы Белого
дома Дональда Трампа, по-прежнему сохраняются надежды на
смягчение санкций США при позитивном развитии
российско-американских отношений, сигналы о котором в последнее
время исходят из Вашингтона и Москвы, и это в том числе
удерживает рубль от негативной реакции на текущий относительно
низкий уровень нефтяных цен.
    На стороне рубля также выступает высокая ключевая ставка
ЦБР, охлаждающая внутренний потребительский спрос, что в том
числе приводит к сокращению покупок инвалюты импортерами. В его
пользу - валютные интервенции Центробанка, который сейчас
продает китайские юани почти на 6 миллиардов рублей в день.
    Давление же на курс в первой половине календарного месяца
может оказывать сокращение продаж экспортной выручки после
уплаты налогов, однако уже со следующей недели сырьевые
корпорации должны активизировать реализацию инвалюты за рубли
под очередные расчеты с бюджетом.
    Негативным фактором для рубля является риск сокращения
притока экспортной выручки с учетом подешевевшей нефти и
последствий западных санкций против российской ""нефтянки"" и
морских средств доставки нефти из РФ, однако и здесь может
перевешивать навес ожиданий, что Вашингтон в перспективе пойдет
на смягчение своих рестрикций против Москвы в этой сфере, о чем
в последнее время появились сообщения в СМИ. 
    Североморская нефтяная смесь Brent <LCOc1> в прошлую среду
падала на отметку $68,33 впервые с начала декабря 2021 года, а
за последние две недели она потеряла в цене почти восемь
процентов.
    Сегодня рынок нефти лихорадит: котировки базовых сортов с
начала понедельника неоднократно меняли цвет, и сейчас они
снижаются. Brent <LCOc1> дешевеет на две трети процента, до
отметки $69,82.
    ""Краткосрочные перспективы нефтяного рынка выглядят умеренно
негативными"", - предупреждает Евстифеев из Зенита.
    По его мнению, большинство факторов свидетельствует в пользу
более низких цен на горизонте нескольких месяцев:
""Неопределенность внешней политики администрации США,
нормализации обстановки на Ближнем Востоке и увеличение
предложения со стороны ОПЕК+ способны сместить диапазон
котировок в $65-70 за баррель Brent"".
    На форексе индекс доллара теряет 0,1% и оценивается в 103,80
<=USD>, пара евро/доллар набирает менее 0,1% и котируется по
$1,0838 <EUR=>.
    Китайский юань теряет сейчас треть процента на
континентальном рынке КНР (7,2566) <CNY=> и около четверти
процента - на офшорном (7,2575) <CNH=>.

2025/3/10 13:33,"FOREX-Опасения о пошлинах, экономическом росте толкают вверх безопасную иену, франк","10 мар (Рейтер) - Японская иена и швейцарский франк
укрепляются по отношению к доллару в понедельник - трейдеры
устремились в валюты-убежища из-за сохраняющихся тревог о
пошлинах и замедлении экономики США. Между тем евро продолжает
подъем после сильного результата на прошлой неделе. 
    Индекс доллара к корзине из шести основных валют <=USD> к
15:57 МСК вырос на 0,09% до 103,76?.
    Японская иена <JPY=> к доллару подорожала на 0,72%? до
146,97, достигнув в пятницу максимума пяти месяцев в 146,94. 
    Швейцарский франк <CHF=> подорожал на 0,3% до 0,8769?, ранее
в ходе сессии достигнув пика трех месяцев в 0,87635 за доллар.
    Внимание рынков приковано к нарастающей торговой
напряженности после того, как президент США Дональд Трамп ввел
пошлины для ключевых торговых партнеров, но отложил некоторые из
них на месяц на фоне усиливающихся тревог о замедлении экономики
США.
    Это привело к падению доверия некоторых инвесторов к
экономике США - на рынке валютных фьючерсов инвесторы сократили
чистые длинные позиции в долларе до $15,3 миллиарда с
девятилетнего максимума в $35,2 миллиарда в конце января.
    Евро <EUR=> был стабилен у отметки $1,0842? и торгуется
вблизи максимума четырех месяцев после волатильной недели, на
которой единая европейская валюта зафиксировала самый крупный
недельный рост с 2009 года. 
    ""Мы видели множество новостей из Германии об обороне и
инфраструктуре, и такое чувство, что что-то из этого будет
реализовано"", - сказал Сэми Чаар из Lombard Odier.
    Настроения инвесторов в еврозоне в марте значительно
улучшились, при этом индекс экономических ожиданий достиг
максимума с июля 2021, показали данные в понедельник.
    Инвесторы ждут публикации в среду данных об инфляции в США.
    Норвежская крона <NOK=> выросла на 1,01% до 10,7474 за
доллар.
    Юань на офшорном рынке <CNH=> подешевел на 0,25% до 7,2595 
- потребительская инфляция в Китае в феврале снизилась самыми
быстрыми темпами с января 2024 года.
    Фунт стерлингов <GBP=> не показывал ярко выраженной
динамики, удерживаясь вблизи отметки $1,2932?.

снижение продаж экспортной выручки после уплаты ежемесячных
налогов, однако со второй половине месяца сырьевые корпорации

    ""Поддержкой по паре юань-рубль выступает отметка 12, а
сопротивление лежит в 50 копейках выше"", - считает Алексей
Антонов из компании Алор Брокер. По его мнению, любой позитив по
переговорам России и США приведет к мощному укреплению рубля.
    Невзирая на переменчивую риторику нынешнего главы Белого

смягчение санкций США при позитивном развитии

    Сегодня рынок нефти вновь котируется в минусе, хотя базовые
сорта и сократили утренние потери. Сейчас баррель Brent <LCOc1>
дешевеет на 0,2% и котируется по $70,24, ранее снижаясь до
$69,84.
    На форексе индекс доллара вышел в плюс и подрастает сейчас
на 0,1% и оценивается в 104,01 <=USD>, пара евро/доллар дешевеет

    Китайский юань теряет 0,4% на континентальном рынке КНР
(7,2651) <CNY=> и почти столько же на офшорном (7,2680) <CNH=>.
    Ключевым событием на текущей неделе для мировых рынков будет
выходящая в среду февральская инфляционная статистика США,
которая отразит изменения потребительских цен уже при политике
Трампа и может стать поводом для изменения риторики ФРС, чье
заседание состоится уже на следующей неделе.

 (新增评论及收盘报价)
       路透北京/上海3月10日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周一收跌267点至7.2649元
，与中间价均创近一周新低；中间价实际值与路透预测偏离水平仍逾600点，不过随着美元
趋弱，监管或有机会逐步放松过滤举措。交易员表示，特朗普政策反复加剧市场不安，但关
税重压下人民币仍整体偏弱。
    
    他们并表示，本周美国可能落地钢铝关税，中国贸易环境更加复杂，这可能进一步加剧
人民币的调整压力；另外中国经济数据显示复苏仍乏力，人民币强势也不符合增长需要，后
续重点关注“两会”后的中间价表现。
    
    “人民币本身不具备升值的条件，今天美元探底反弹，人民币跟着调整，”一外资行交
易员称，“还是偏区间判断，除非美元继续大幅下行。”
        
  
    
    另一中资行交易员也表示，基本面有多有空，市场多空力量也均衡，应该就是震荡。
    
    平安银行认为，人民币持续大幅升值会冲击中国出口，美元/人民币汇率保持基本稳定
，CFETS汇率指数走弱，可能是比较好组合。
    
    瑞穗银行亚洲首席策略师张建泰最新点评称，中国面临的通缩压力提醒市场，今年中国
经济增长前景充满挑战，贸易战不确定性也将使人民币处于劣势；密切关注本周中国人大和
政协“两会”结束后人民币中间价的走势。
    
    在今年春节错月叠加翘尾因素拖累加重的影响下，中国2月CPI（居民消费价格指数）同
比时隔逾一年再现负值，创下去年1月以来最低水平；核心CPI同比更是逾四年来首次转为负
值。CPI环比亦为三个月来首次转负。
    
    兴业研究观点指出，当前市场关注焦点从美国转向欧洲，非美货币仍处在反弹的波段中
。人民币收盘价正在向中间价收敛，并轨后有望进一步打开人民币升值空间。未来一个月美
国“对等关税”和对汽车、半导体、药品、木材等施加关税的消息将反复拷问市场，可能带
来波动率的上升。
    
    美国2月就业岗位增长加快，但在混乱的贸易政策和联邦政府大幅削减开支有可能扰乱
今年经济增长的情况下，一直坚挺的劳动力市场正在出现裂痕。美联储主席鲍威尔表示，特
朗普政府的关税计划是否会刺激通胀还有待观察，但仍无需仓促降息。
    
    
    LSEG的数据显示，交易商正在对美联储今年降息75个基点进行定价，其中6月份降息的
前景已被市场充分消化。

2025/3/10 8:10,"Юань отступает на фоне усиления торговой напряженности, слабых статданных","ШАНХАЙ, 10 мар (Рейтер) - Юань идет вниз в понедельник,
несмотря на широкую слабость доллара, из-за опасений об
эскалации глобальной торговой войны и новых признаков
экономической нестабильности.
    Аналитики считают, что более активные действия правительства
окажут поддержку юаню, и отмечают, что Пекин не проявляет
нежелания использовать ослабление валюты как способ
противостоять экономическим последствиям повышения американских
пошлин.
    Спотовый юань в Китайской системе валютной торговли SFETS на
материковом рынке <CNY=CFXS> к 09:43 МСК опустился на 0,18%
до? 7,2562?, а на офшорном рынке <CNH=> - подешевел на 0,23%
до 7,258. 
    ""Мы ожидаем, что в ближайшие три месяца пара доллар/юань в
основном будет оставаться в существующем диапазоне, а ключевым
фактором колебаний будет общая динамика доллара и свежие новости
о пошлинах"", - отметили аналитики Goldman Sachs.
    ""Продолжающееся торговое расследование Соединенных Штатов,
которое должно завершиться к 1 апреля, может повлечь за собой
новые заголовки о тарифах, усиливая неопределенность на валютном
рынке"".
    Пекин в субботу объявил о введении пошлин на канадскую
сельскохозяйственную продукцию и продукты питания стоимостью
$2,6 миллиарда в ответ на тарифы, введенные Оттавой в октябре,
что отражает дальнейшее усиление торговой напряженности.
    Потребительская инфляция в Китае в феврале снизилась самыми
быстрыми темпами с января 2024 года, а дефляция цен
производителей сохранялась из-за ослабления сезонного спроса, в
то время как домохозяйства по-прежнему проявляют осторожность в
расходах из-за тревог по поводу трудоустройства и дохода.
    Перед открытием сессии ЦБ Китая объявил срединный
фиксированный курс <CNY=PBOC> на уровне 7,1733 за доллар.

2025/3/10 6:50,Рубль продолжит отслеживать внешнеполитический новостной фон,"МОСКВА, 10 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль на второй неделе марта
может оставаться под давлением сезонного снижения продаж
экспортной выручки после уплаты ежемесячных налогов, но при этом
ключевым драйвером для российской валюты вновь будет выступать
внешнеполитическая новостная повестка, в целом позитивная для
российских активов в текущем году.
    Помимо геополитики и краткосрочной сезонности, влияние на
котировки рубля, причем негативное, могут оказывать опасения за
приток экспортной выручки с учетом подешевевшей нефти и
последствий западных санкций против российской ""нефтянки"" и
морских средств доставки нефти из РФ. 
    Внутренней поддержкой выступает высокая ключевая ставка ЦБР,
охлаждающая внутренний потребительский спрос, что в том числе
приводит к сокращению покупок инвалюты импортерами. Также на
стороне российской валюты играют интервенции Центробанка,
который сейчас продает китайские юани почти на 6 миллиардов
рублей в день.
    Пятничные торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра""
завершились на уровне 12,13 рубля за юань - российская валюта
подорожала на 1,2% при объеме сделок в 101 миллиард рублей, при
этом по итогам первой недели марта она показала символическое
снижение.
    В паре с долларом рубль на форексе подешевел в пятницу на
1,1% <RUB=>, потеряв за неделю 0,7%, согласно данным LSEG.
    В паре с евро рубль по итогам пятницы потерял 1,6%, завершив
торги на форексе котировкой 97,50, а по итогам недели российская
валюта упала против европейской на 5,1%, что во многом связано
со значительным укреплением евро на внешних рынках.
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> почти не изменилась на форексе по
итогам пятничных торгов, завершив их на уровне 12,23, а за
неделю рубль укрепился против юаня на полтора процента, согласно
данным LSEG.
    Концовка пятницы оказалась для рубля несколько смазанной -
раздрай в котировки внесли комментарии президента США Дональда
Трампа, который вновь призвал Россию и Украину немедленно начать
переговоры о мире, но при этом пригрозил Москве масштабными
банковскими санкциями и торговыми тарифами, пока не будет
достигнуто соглашение о прекращении огня и полном урегулировании
конфликта. Биржевой валютный рынок лишь краткосрочно тряхнуло, и
в итоге он не показал заметной итоговой реакции на слова Трампа,
но внешние игроки оказались более осторожными, усилив покупку
СКВ за рубли.
    ""Мы не считаем, что угрозы более жестких санкций и
негативная риторика со стороны властей США будут стремительно
нарастать, так как переговоры с Россией находятся в начальной
фазе и наши власти проявляет готовность к переговорам"", - сказал
Евгений Локтюхов из ПСБ. 
    Невзирая на переменчивую риторику нынешнего главы Белого
дома, сохраняются надежды на смягчение санкций США при
позитивном развитии российско-американских отношений, сигналы о
котором в последнее время исходят из Вашингтона и Москвы, и это
в том числе на прошлой неделе удерживало рубль от полноценной
реакции на динамику нефтяного рынка.
    Североморская нефтяная смесь Brent <LCOc1> в прошлую среду
падала на отметку 68,33 впервые с начала декабря 2021 года, а за
последние две недели она потеряла в цене почти восемь процентов.
    Сегодня утром рынок нефти вновь в минусе, баррель Brent
<LCOc1> дешевеет на 0,6% и котируется по $69,94.
    На форексе индекс доллара снижается на 0,1% и оценивается в
103,78 <=USD>, пара евро/доллар минимально подрастает и
котируется по $1,0840 <EUR=>.
    Китайский юань теряет порядка четверти процента на
континентальном рынке КНР (7,2551) <CNY=> и на офшорном (7,2585)
<CNH=>.
    Ключевым событием на текущей неделе для мировых рынков будет
выходящая в среду февральская инфляционная статистика США,
которая отразит изменения потребительских цен уже при политике
Трампа и может стать поводом для изменения риторики ФРС, чье
заседание состоится уже на следующей неделе.

2025/3/10 5:56,Asia markets mixed in response to weak Chinese CPI and PPI data; tariff uncertainty,"Asia markets mixed in response to weak Chinese CPI and PPI data; tariff uncertaintyAsia-Pacific markets mixed on Monday as traders continued to closely monitor developments in tariff talks amid a lack of domestic market catalysts. China's retaliatory tariffs on US farm goods took effect, following the US hiking tariffs on Chinese goods from 10% to 20%.

Traders reacted to fresh data from China over the weekend, which showed that consumer prices fell the most in 13 months in February, while producer deflation persisted for the 29th month despite a slower fall.

Japan (NKY:IND) rose 0.42% to around 3,990, while the broader Topix Index edged up 0.1% to 2,712 on Monday, recovering some losses from the previous session. The Japanese yen strengthened past 148 per dollar on Monday, hovering at a five-month high.

Domestically, data showed that Japan posted a current account deficit in January for the first time in two years, as imports outpaced exports. Additionally, inflation-adjusted real wages―a key measure of consumer purchasing power―fell 1.8% year-on-year, marking the first decline in three months.

China (SHCOMP) fell 0.62% to below 3,360, while the Shenzhen Component lost 0.3% to 10,810 on Monday, extending losses from the previous session as persistent deflationary pressures underscored China's economic challenges, and the offshore yuan depreciated around 7.25 per dollar as investors reacted to China's weaker-than-expected inflation data.

China announced on Saturday that it will impose a 100% tariff on imports of certain Canadian agricultural products, including rapeseed oil, oil cakes, and peas, along with a 25% levy on aquatic products and pork.

Hong Kong (HSI) fell 2.29% to 23,888 on Monday morning, extending losses from the prior period amid widespread sector falls.

Locally, Hong Kong's foreign exchange reserves fell to an 8-month low in February, following a period of stability over the previous three months.

India (SENSEX) rose 0.40% to 74,601 in early deals on Monday, hitting a near two-week peak, with the Nifty 50 climbing 0.4% to above 22,600, after being flat in the previous session, supported by strength in consumer goods, metals, and realty.

Australia (AS51) rose 0.18% to around 7,970 on Monday, recovering some losses from the previous session, as mining and energy stocks led gains amid firmer commodity prices. The Australian dollar steadied around $0.63 on Monday, pausing a two-day decline.

In the U.S., on Friday, all three major indexes ended higher recovered from earlier losses after Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated confidence in inflation progress while emphasizing no urgency to cut rates.

On Sunday, US President Donald Trump described the economy as undergoing ""a period of transition"" during a Fox News interview, when asked about the risk of a recession.

U.S. stock futures declined on Monday ahead of the inflation and JOLTS data: Dow -0.43%; S&P 500 -0.46%; Nasdaq -0.51%.

Markets are closely watching consumer inflation expectations set for release on Monday, followed by consumer inflation data on Wednesday, producer inflation figures on Thursday, and a consumer sentiment report on Friday.

Currencies: (JPY:USD), (CNY:USD), (AUD:USD), (INR:USD), (HKD:USD), (NZD:USD).

2025/3/10 5:26,"China's CPI fell for first time in 13 months, PPI deflation persists","China's CPI fell for first time in 13 months, PPI deflation persistsChina's consumer prices fell 0.7% year-on-year in February, a 13-month low, exceeding the expected 0.5% drop and reversing January's 0.5% rise. Producer deflation also continued, down 2.2% year-on-year, compared with market forecasts of a 2.1% decline and after a 2.3% drop in the prior two months, though at its slowest pace since August 2024.

China's food prices fell 3.3% year-over-year in February 2025, swinging from a 0.4% increase in the previous month and marking the first decline this year.

Monthly, the CPI fell 0.2%, shifting from January's 11-month top of a 0.7% rise and marking the first drop since last November. This fall was also steeper than consensus of a 0.1% decrease.

Meanwhile, despite Beijing's recent political meeting emphasizing economic growth support, persistent weak demand and escalating US trade tensions continue to create uncertainty. China's new tariffs on U.S. farm products are now in effect, and further trade disputes are anticipated with the upcoming 100% tariffs on select Canadian agricultural goods, a direct response to U.S. tariff threats.

China announced on Saturday that it will impose a 100% tariff on imports of certain Canadian agricultural products, including rapeseed oil, oil cakes, and peas, along with a 25% levy on aquatic products and pork.

The Shanghai Composite fell 0.4% to below 3,360, while the Shenzhen Component lost 0.3% to 10,810 on Monday, extending losses from the previous session as persistent deflationary pressures underscored China's economic challenges, and the offshore yuan depreciated around 7.25 per dollar as investors reacted to China's weaker-than-expected inflation data.

2025/3/10 3:56,China's yuan slips amid heightened trade tensions and weak data,"SHANGHAI, March 10 (Reuters) - China's yuan slipped on
Monday despite a broadly weaker dollar, dragged lower by worries
over an escalating global trade war and fresh signs of economic
wobbles.    
    Analysts say more proactive government policies would lend
support to the yuan, noting that Beijing is not showing any
unwillingness to use currency weakness as a way of countering
the economic impact of higher U.S. tariffs.
    The onshore yuan <CNY=CFXS> was trading at roughly 7.25 per
dollar around noon time, 0.2% weaker than the previous close. 
    The yuan's weakness comes even as the dollar index <.DXY>
slipped further following five straight sessions of declines
amid growing worries that U.S. President Donald Trump's trade
war could hit the U.S. economy.
    ""We expect USD/CNY to stay largely range-bound over the next
three months, with the key swing factor leaning towards the
broad USD and fresh tariff news,"" Goldman Sachs said in a
report.
    ""The ongoing U.S. trade probe, set to conclude by April 1,
may trigger further tariff headlines, adding to FX uncertainty.""
    In further signs of growing trade tensions, China on
Saturday announced tariffs on over $2.6 billion worth of
Canadian agricultural and food products, retaliating against
levies Ottawa introduced in October.
    Sentiment was also undermined by weekend data showing
China's consumer price index in February fell at the sharpest
pace in 13 months, deepening worries about the economy following
last week's disappointing trade data. 
    However, analysts say the yuan's fall would be limited by
growing pessimism towards the U.S. economy due to tariff
uncertainty. 
    The dollar index has slumped 3.5% so far this month, while
the yuan has strengthened 0.3% against the greenback. 
    ""With growing expectations of a Trump-induced U.S. economic
recession, 'U.S. exceptionalism' could unravel ... and it's time
for Chinese companies and individuals to think twice about
buying U.S. dollar,"" said Guan Tao, economist at BOC
International (China).
    He added that new U.S. tariffs will have less of an impact
on the yuan as markets had been expecting worsening trade
relations under a second Trump administration.
    Prior to market open on Monday, the People's Bank of China
(PBOC) set the yuan guidance rate at 7.1733 per dollar, keeping
the fixing stable despite two rounds of U.S. tariff increases on
China.
    ""It appears the PBOC may be less willing to use FX weakness,
at least at this juncture, when the U.S. tariff policy remains
fluid and changing rapidly,"" Goldman Sachs said.
    ""Moreover, keeping the FX stable offers the PBOC more policy
options later.""

       路透北京3月10日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周一早盘创近一周新低；中间价亦小跌至近一周低点，与路透预测偏离水平仍逾620点，近期美元疲软，监管或有机会逐步放松过滤举措。交易员表示，特朗普政策反复加剧市场对美国经济担忧，避险情绪升温重新施压人民币。
    
    他们并表示，短期中国面临的关税压力仍然不小，人民币缺乏大幅反弹可能性；不过若美元继续趋弱，特朗普关税政策维持温和，人民币也有机会积累部分升值动能。
    
    “短期看是区间震荡行情，上下都有顶的感觉，”一外资行交易员称。
    
    另一中资行交易员也表示，基本面有多有空，市场多空力量也均衡，应该就是震荡。
    
    
    瑞穗银行亚洲首席策略师张建泰最新点评称，中国面临的通缩压力提醒市场，今年中国经济增长前景充满挑战，贸易战不确定性也将使人民币处于劣势；密切关注本周中国人大和政协“两会”结束后人民币中间价的走势。
    
    在今年春节错月叠加翘尾因素拖累加重的影响下，中国2月CPI（居民消费价格指数）同比时隔逾一年再现负值，创下去年1月以来最低水平；核心CPI同比更是逾四年来首次转为负值。CPI环比亦为三个月来首次转负。
    
    中金公司报告认为，短期内人民币汇率波动受外部影响较大，关键变量仍是美国经济预期及关税等外生冲击的变化。若美国经济预期继续偏弱，且关税预期相对温和，人民币汇率仍有小幅升值空间。
    
    兴业研究观点也指出，当前市场关注焦点从美国转向欧洲，非美货币仍处在反弹的波段中。人民币收盘价正在向中间价收敛，并轨后有望进一步打开人民币升值空间。未来一个月美国“对等关税”和对汽车、半导体、药品、木材等施加关税的消息将反复拷问市场，可能带来波动率的上升。
    
    美国2月就业岗位增长加快，但在混乱的贸易政策和联邦政府大幅削减开支有可能扰乱今年经济增长的情况下，一直坚挺的劳动力市场正在出现裂痕。
    
    美联储主席鲍威尔上周五表示，特朗普政府的关税计划是否会刺激通胀还有待观察，并列出了一系列需要核实的因素，这些因素可能会使新关税引发更持久的价格压力。

    美国2月就业岗位增长加快，但在混乱的贸易政策和联邦政府大幅削减开支有可能扰乱今年经济增长的情况下，一直坚挺的劳动力市场正在出现裂痕。
    
    美联储主席鲍威尔上周五表示，特朗普政府的关税计划是否会刺激通胀还有待观察，并列出了一系列需要核实的因素，这些因素可能会使新关税引发更持久的价格压力。

    上日人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>收报7.2382元，而中间价则为7.1705元。根据定价机制，今日中间价变动中，有677点下跌反映市场供求影响，另有27点上涨反映的是隔夜一篮子汇率基本保持不变所需要的点数；“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。

    路透测算的上日人民币兑美元中间价为7.2406元，和外汇交易中心公布的实际值偏差701点。上日路透根据CFETS公布的中间价测算，人民币汇率CFETS指数、参考SDR（特别提款权）篮子指数和参考BIS(国际清算银行)篮子指数分别为99.05、93.11和105.13。

    上日(截至北京时间次日凌晨3点)人民币兑美元即期累计成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为397.71亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

Weekend data showed consumer prices fell 0.7% year-on-year in February, a 13-month low, exceeding the expected 0.5% drop and reversing January’s 0.5% rise. Producer deflation also continued, down 2.2% year-on-year, though at its slowest pace since August 2024.

2025/3/9 23:57,《汇市简讯》亚洲前瞻：聚焦区域市场、中国以及美国政府相关消息,"路透3月10日 - 周五公布的美国非农就业报告表现稳健，缓解人们对经济增长迅速放缓的担忧，但由于政策不确定性大幅升高，投资者持谨慎态度。美联储主席鲍威尔表示，特朗普政府的关税计划是否会引发通胀还有待观察，但经济""形势良好""。
    
    华尔街反弹，美债收益率攀升，美元走软，大宗商品收盘涨跌不一。
    
    周末消息方面，中国2月份CPI下降，通缩压力加深；德国大选获胜者梅尔茨(Friedrich Merz)领导的保守派和社会民主党清除了组建执政联盟的第一道障碍。
    
    新兴市场ETF上涨0.5%，亚洲市场指引正面。日本经常帐和贸易数据主导清淡的区域数据日程。通胀数据公布后，以中国为首的地区市场将成为关注焦点，另外也将关注美国政府任何出人意料的消息，本周市场将充满看点。
    
    受鲍威尔对经济看法的支撑，道指上涨0.52%，标普500指数上涨0.55%，纳指上涨0.7%，但标普指数录得 9 月以来最大单周跌幅。
    
    美债收益率因鲍威尔谨慎的降息立场而上升，两年期收益率上涨4个基点至4.000%，10年期收益率涨2个基点至4.305%，30年期收益率上升3个基点至4.602%。
    
    油价上涨，受OPEC+调升4月价格的担忧影响，布兰特原油上扬1.3%，美国原油上涨1%。美铜下跌1.9%，因中国贸易数据疲软。受避险需求支撑，黄金上涨0.05%。
    
    在欧洲货币的带动下，美元下跌0.2%，欧元/美元因刺激憧憬而上涨 0.45%，英镑上涨0.3%。美元/日圆和美元/离岸人民币持平，澳元和新西兰元下跌0.4，受制于中国数据疲软，美元/加元在就业数据弱于预期后上涨0.55%。
    
    比特币在2200GMT下跌4.9%，至 81956 美元。

2025/3/9 23:35,"BUZZ-Asia Day Ahead-Focus on regional markets, China, headlines","March 10 (Reuters) - 
    The solid U.S. jobs report on Friday cooled concerns about a rapid growth
slowdown, but with policy uncertainty surging, investors are cautious. Federal
Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said it remains to be seen if the Trump
administration's tariff plans will be inflationary, but the economy is ""in a
good place"". 
    Wall Street bounced, Treasury yields climbed, the U.S. dollar eased and
commodities closed mixed.
    In weekend news, China's deflationary pressures deepened in February, as CPI
fell; German election winner Friedrich Merz's conservatives and the Social
Democrats cleared the first hurdle to forming a coalition.
    A positive lead for Asia with EM ETFs up 0.5%. Japanese current account and
trade figures lead the light regional data schedule. The focus will be on
regional markets, led by China after the inflation data, and any surprises from
the U.S. administration, ahead of another interesting week.
    Dow +0.52%, S&P +0.55%, and Nasdaq +0.7%, supported by Powell's comment on
the economy, but the S&P recorded the largest weekly loss since September.
    Treasury yields rose on Powell's cautious rate-cut stance, 2yr +4bp to
4.000, 10yr +2bp to 4.305%, and 30yr +3bp to 4.602% on TradeWeb.
    Oil climbed on OPEC+ April price rise fears, Brent +1.3%, WTI +1%. U.S.
copper fell 1.9% on the weak China trade data. Gold +0.05%, supported by
safe-haven demand.
    The U.S. dollar fell 0.2% led by European currencies, EUR/USD +0.45% on
stimulus hopes, and GBP +0.3%. USD/JPY and USD/CNH flat, AUD and NZD -0.4,
capped by soft China data, USD/CAD +0.55% after weaker-than-expected jobs.
    Bitcoin traded down 4.9% to $81,956 at 2200 GMT.

2025/3/7 15:08,Рубль остался в плюсе к доллару и юаню вопреки угрозам Трампа,"МОСКВА, 7 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль в пятницу показывал
значительные изменения с опорой на изменения санкционного
сентимента, при этом значительную часть торгов он в позитивном
ключе отыгрывал надежды на смягчение санкций США против РФ, а
под вечер растерял лишь незначительную часть преимущества после
комментариев Дональда Трампа с угрозами новых рестрикций в адрес
Москвы.
    Первоначально драйвером для оптимизма могли стать сообщения,
что представители РСПП и Торговой палаты США обсуждали
возможность снятия американских санкций, в том числе
переподключение российских банков к системе SWIFT.
    Затем новостной фон ухудшился: президент США Дональд Трамп
сообщил, что всерьез рассматривает возможность введения
масштабных банковских санкций, других санкций и торговых тарифов
против России, призвав Москву и Киев немедленно начать мирные
переговоры.
    Судя по последующей динамике рубля, валютный рынок не нашел
причин для сильной паники в комментариях Трампа, поскольку
торгово-экономические отношения США и России и так находятся на
низком уровне после введенных в предыдущие годы ограничений и
запретов.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 17.35 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 12,19, и российская валюта
набирает 0,6%, утром дешевея до 12,32, но затем активно
укрепляясь до недельного пика 12,07.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 17.35 МСК
котировалась по 88,92, и рубль дорожает на 0,5%, ранее
отметившись на недельном максимуме 88,60.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 96,68, и
рубль здесь дешевеет на 0,6%.
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 12,23, что почти совпадает с последними котировками
четверга.
    Надежды на смягчение рестрикций США при позитивном развитии
российско-американских отношений, сигналы о котором исходят из
Вашингтона и Москвы, в предыдущие дни удерживали рубль от
глубокой коррекции с достигнутых на прошлой неделе многомесячных
пиков и от полноценной реакции на отрицательную динамику
нефтяного рынка.
    На стороне рубля при этом в течение торгов выступали отскок
нефти с многолетних минимумов, снижение валютного спроса от
российских импортеров, а также малозаметная сегодня минимизация
риска на выходные.
    Локальной поддержкой остаются ежедневные нетто-продажи
китайской валюты Центробанком.
    Рубль за счет достигнутого в пятницу запаса прочности сумел
переломить недельную динамику в парах с долларом на форексе и
юанем на бирже. Сейчас он дорожает по отношению к валюте США на
полпроцента, против китайской - на две трети процента, но
одновременно слабеет к евро на 4,2%.
    Значительную роль в такой динамике рублевых кросс-курсов
сыграли падение валюты США и укрепление единой европейской на
форексе до экстремальных значений за последние четыре месяца.
Сегодня индекс доллара после невпечатляющей трудовой статистики
США дешевел до 103,46 <=USD>, его текущие потери составляют
полпроцента. Пара евро/доллар растет с начала пятницы на 0,7%,
ранее достигнув уровня $1,0888 <EUR=>.
    Нефть сегодня дорожает, баррель Brent <LCOc1> - на 2,1% до
$70,93, но с теряет 3,1% с начала текущей недели, в середине
которой североморская смесь падала до $68,33 впервые со 2
декабря 2021 года.
    Риски сокращения притока валютной выручки с учетом
подешевевшей нефти, а также последствий западных санкций против
российской ""нефтянки"" и морских средств доставки нефти из РФ
оказывали давление на курс рубля на текущей неделе.

2025/3/7 14:36,BUZZ-FX options wrap - FX volatility and USD risk premiums elevated,"A weaker USD and stronger EUR and to a lesser extent a stronger JPY were the
main drivers of FX options this week - boosting related implied volatility and
premiums for USD puts over calls. 
    Overnight expiry implied volatility including Friday's monthly U.S. jobs
data reached its highest levels since the U.S. election and highlighted a market
that was probably still short of USD puts and alert to the risk of a weak data
set providing the catalyst for a deeper USD rout.
    The data was only just below expectations and the FX reaction was
consequently limited. However, the USD remains weak and prone to further losses
and that's limiting overall setbacks for implied volatility and its USD put
premium.
    Directional trade flows in the major pairings have been keen to cover for
GBP/USD regaining 1.3000 and EUR/USD above 1.1000 in the short term. EUR call
spreads and EUR calls with reverse knock out triggers are said to have been well
sought this week. Short covering of EUR calls was also evident in risk
reversals, with sub 3-month expiries flipping to a EUR call from a EUR put
premium and subsequently reaching their highest lvels for topside strikes since
2022 and 2020.  
    USD/JPY options continue to favour the downside via various strategies
including those that are leaning on existing 145.00 strike barriers to cheapen
their premiums.

2025/3/7 10:52,BUZZ-COMMENT-Options flash NFP warning for extreme USD/FX volatility,"March 7 (Reuters) - FX volatility risk premiums for options covering
Friday's U.S. jobs report are at their highest levels since the U.S. election,
with a strong bias toward further USD weakness.
    Volatility is an unknown yet key part of an FX option premium, so implied
volatility acts as a proxy. Any disparity between implied and actual/realised
volatility can present trading opportunities. Overnight expiry options first
included the U.S. jobs data from Thursday and have seen a notable implied
volatility surge which has significantly increased the premium/break-evens. 
    The passing of Thursday's European Central bank risk has allowed overnight
EUR/USD premiums to ease slightly, but they remain nearly double last week's
levels at 75 USD pips in either direction for a simple vanilla straddle. Risk
reversals continue to show a strong implied volatility premium for USD puts over
calls, reinforcing expectations of further USD weakness.
    For USD/JPY, the premium break-even for overnight expiry straddles has risen
from an already elevated 136 JPY pips on Thursday to 150 JPY pips on Friday -
almost double its average over recent weeks. The recent USD decline has also
driven higher premiums for USD puts across USD/JPY risk reversals.
    Meanwhile, the AUD/USD overnight expiry premium break-even has jumped to 40
USD pips in either direction, double its recent lows.
    Given the recent and broad-based USD slide, weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs
data could further accelerate USD losses.

2025/3/7 10:24,"Рубль вернулся к росту на МОЕХ, показывает смешанную динамику на FX","МОСКВА, 7 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль в пятницу днем вышел в
плюс на Мосбирже после трех дней снижения, но пока сохраняет
негативную недельную динамику на фоне относительно дешевой нефти
и превалирования в последнее время на рынке реальных покупателей
инвалюты.
    Сегодня же нефть заметно подрастает, а реальный спрос на
валюту ушел в тень при одновременно невысоком, что характерно
для последнего времени, объеме минимизации риска на выходные
дни.
    Внешней поддержкой по-прежнему выступает в целом позитивный
геополитический фон, пусть и не засветившийся на текущей неделе
прорывными новостями, а локальной - ежедневные нетто-продажи
китайской валюты Центробанком.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 13.00 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 12,22, и российская валюта
набирает 0,4%, утром дешевея до 12,32.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к 11.30 МСК
котировались вблизи отметок 12,23, 89,70 и 96,90 соответственно,
и рубль набирает 0,5% к юаню, 0,6% к доллару и 0,2% к евро.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 13.00 МСК
котировалась по 88,85, и рубль дорожает на 0,2%. 
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 96,96, и
рубль здесь дешевеет на 1%.
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 12,24, и рубль теряет 0,1%.
    Рубль к доллару с начала недели укрепляется на 0,6%, но
одновременно слабеет к евро на 4,5%. Значительную роль в такой
динамике рублевых кросс-курсов сыграли падение валюты США и
укрепление единой европейской на форексе до экстремальных
значений за последние четыре месяца. Сегодня индекс доллара
дешевел до 103,56 <=USD>, его текущие потери составляют
полпроцента. Пара евро/доллар растет с начала пятницы на 0,7%,
ранее достигнув уровня $1,0871 <EUR=>.
    В биржевой паре с юанем рубль на горизонте недели сменил
знак с минуса на плюс, и сейчас набирает четверть процента. 
    На внутреннем рынке негативное влияние на курс рубля могут
оказывать риски сокращения притока валютной выручки с учетом
подешевевшей нефти, а также последствий западных санкций против
российской ""нефтянки"" и морских средств доставки нефти из РФ.
    Поддержкой продолжают выступать надежды на смягчение санкций
США при позитивном развитии российско-американских отношений,
сигналы о котором исходят из Вашингтона и Москвы, и это удержало
рубль от глубокой коррекции с достигнутых на прошлой неделе
многомесячных пиков и от полноценной реакции на динамику
нефтяного рынка.
    ""Новостной фон в краткосрочной перспективе, вероятно,
останется умеренно-позитивным. Также мы допускаем, что
экспортеры, с учетом относительно крепких позиций рубля, могут
начать подготовку к крупным налоговым выплатам марта
заблаговременно - в середине месяца, что, при благоприятном
новостном фоне, может привести к новой волне укрепления рубля"",
- считает Денис Попов из Промсвязьбанка. 
    Нефть сегодня дорожает, баррель Brent <LCOc1> - на 1,3% до
отметки $70,38, но с теряет 4,8% с начала текущей недели, в
течение которой североморская смесь падала до $68,33 впервые со
2 декабря 2021 года.

2025/3/7 9:48,BUZZ-COMMENT-Simple FX options to leverage long EUR/USD positions,"March 7 (Reuters) - Investors looking to gain exposure to EUR/USD
without committing to a spot trade might consider FX options, which limit risk
to an upfront premium.
    A EUR call/USD put option grants the holder the right, but not the
obligation, to buy EUR/USD at a predetermined strike price on a set expiry date.
However, the recent surge in EUR/USD to fresh highs since November has
significantly increased option premiums. Implied volatility, a key factor in
option pricing, is now at its highest levels since January, and the premium for
upside strikes over downside strikes has reached levels last seen in 2022 and
2020.
    One way to reduce the cost of EUR call/USD put options is by adding a
knock-out (KO) trigger above the strike price. Since a KO trigger renders the
option worthless if touched before expiry, it lowers the premium as the
likelihood of it being hit increases. 
    For example, with EUR/USD spot at 1.0850, a three-month expiry 1.1000 EUR
call/USD put costs 132 USD pips, meaning it turns profitable if EUR/USD rises
above 1.1132 by expiry (June 9, 10 AM New York time). However, introducing a KO
trigger at 1.1500 reduces the premium to 42 USD pips, while lowering the trigger
to 1.1300 further cuts it to just 11 USD pips.
    In this scenario, the break-even level would be 1.1011, but profit potential
is capped at the KO trigger, and the option becomes worthless if the trigger is
hit before expiry.
    An alternative strategy is a EUR call/USD put spread, which involves selling
a higher-strike EUR call/USD put to offset the cost of purchasing a lower-strike
one. This keeps the option active until expiry while reducing the initial
outlay, though profit is limited to the upper strike. Strikes and maturity dates
can be tailored to suit.

2025/3/7 8:53,Юань стабилен: инвесторы взвешивают влияние пошлин,"ГОНКОНГ, 7 мар (Рейтер) - Юань не показывает ярко
выраженной динамики в пятницу, несмотря на ослабление доллара,
так как неопределенность вокруг пошлин США и их возможного
влияния на китайский экспорт вызывает беспокойство инвесторов.
    Импорт Китая неожиданно сократился в январе-феврале, а
экспорт замедлил рост на фоне усиления давления Соединенных
Штатов в области пошлин.
    Спотовый юань в Китайской системе валютной торговли SFETS на
материковом рынке <CNY=CFXS> к 10:17 МСК был стабилен на
уровне 7,2475?, а на офшорном рынке <CNH=> - малоподвижен вблизи
отметки 7,2478. 
    Администрация Трампа на этой неделе удвоила тарифы на весь
китайский импорт до 20%, на что Пекин оперативно ответил
встречными пошлинами в размере 10%-15% на определенные товары из
США.
    Некоторые аналитики полагают, что недавняя стабильность юаня
будет недолговечной, учитывая, что китайская валюта может
столкнуться с более серьезными рисками в случае повышения
торговых тарифов США и введения дополнительных инвестиционных
ограничений.
    ""В Азии юань демонстрировал более стабильную динамику,
однако мы по-прежнему считаем, что снижение валюты - лишь вопрос
времени"", - отметили в записке аналитики Barclays.
    ""Негативное влияние более высоких тарифов США на экспорт
Китая, вероятно, проявится в следующем месяце"", - сказал Чживэй
Чжан из Pinpoint Asset Management.
    Перед открытием сессии ЦБ Китая объявил срединный
фиксированный курс <CNY=PBOC> на уровне 7,1705 за доллар. При
этом значение оказалось на 701 pips (десятитысячных долей
процентного пункта) сильнее приведенного Рейтер прогноза
аналитиков.

2025/3/7 8:16,Рубль на пути к недельному снижению из-за нефти и рынка покупателей валюты,"МОСКВА, 7 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль в пятницу умеренно
дешевеет на Мосбирже и на форексе, а также движется к итоговому
недельному снижению на фоне относительно дешевой нефти и
превалирования на рынке реальных покупателей инвалюты.
    Сегодня дополнительным фактором давления может выступать
минимизация риска на выходные дни, хотя в последнее время она не
сильно проявляет себя
    Поддержкой же по-прежнему выступает в целом позитивный
геополитический фон, пусть и не засветившийся на текущей неделе
прорывными новостями, а локально - ежедневные нетто-продажи
китайской валюты Центробанком.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 11.00 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 12,30, и российская валюта
теряет 0,3%.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к 11.00 МСК
котировались вблизи отметок 12,31, 90,30 и 97,30 соответственно,
и рубль теряет 0,1% к юаню, 0,1% к доллару и 0,2% к евро.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 11.00 МСК
котировалась по 89,45, и рубль дешевеет на 0,5%. 
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 96,95, и
рубль здесь дешевеет на 1%
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 12,22, что близко к предыдущему закрытию.
    Потери рубля к доллару с начала недели составляют 0,1%, к
евро - 4,5%. Свою роль в такой динамике рублевых кросс-курсов
сыграли падение валюты США <=USD> и укрепление единой
европейской EUR=> на форексе до экстремальных значений за
последние четыре месяца.
    В биржевой паре с юанем рубль теряет с начала недели две
трети процента.
    На внутреннем рынке негативное влияние на курс рубля могут
оказывать риски сокращения притока валютной выручки с учетом
подешевевшей нефти, а также последствий западных санкций против
российской ""нефтянки"" и морских средств доставки нефти из РФ.
    Негативное влияние на котировки рубля сейчас оказывает и
баланс реальных денежных потоков в пользу покупателей валюты, в
том числе за счет восстановления спроса импортеров после
традиционного спада в начале года при одновременном
краткосрочном сезонном снижении активности экспорта в первые дни
календарного месяца после уплаты корпоративных налогов.
    Одновременно сохраняются надежды на смягчение санкций США
при позитивном развитии российско-американских отношений,
сигналы о котором исходят из Вашингтона и Москвы, и это удержало
рубль от глубокой коррекции с достигнутых на прошлой неделе
многомесячных пиков и от полноценной реакции на динамику
нефтяного рынка.
    ""Новостной фон в краткосрочной перспективе, вероятно,
останется умеренно-позитивным. Также мы допускаем, что
экспортеры, с учетом относительно крепких позиций рубля, могут
начать подготовку к крупным налоговым выплатам марта
заблаговременно - в середине месяца, что, при благоприятном
новостном фоне, может привести к новой волне укрепления рубля"",
- считает Денис Попов из Промсвязьбанка. 
    Сегодня нефть дорожает, баррель Brent <LCOc1> - на 0,8% до
отметки $70,00, но формирует худшую с середины октября неделю
(-4,4%), в течение которой североморская смесь падала до $68,33
впервые со 2 декабря 2021 года. 
    На форексе индекс доллара дешевеет на 0,3% и оценивается в
103,87 <=USD>, котируясь вблизи достигнутого накануне
четырехмесячного минимума 103,75. Пара евро/доллар растет на
0,4% и котируется по $1,0830 <EUR=>, накануне отметившись на
максимуме с 6 ноября, $1,0853.

трудовой статистики США в 15.30 МСК, а также вечерние

2025/3/7 7:51,"China's trade surplus surpass forecasts, exports grow by 2.3% and imports shrink","China's trade surplus surpass forecasts, exports grow by 2.3% and imports shrinkChina's trade surplus surpassed forecasts, surging USD 170.51 billion for January-February 2025 up from USD 125.16 billion in the same period a year earlier, exceeding market expectations of USD 142.4 billion.

Exports from China grew by 2.3% y/y to USD 540 billion in January-February 2025, missing market forecasts of 5.0%, reflecting escalating trade tensions with the US and subdued activity during the Lunar New Year break.

China's imports fell by 8.4% y/y to USD 369.4 billion in January-February 2025, missing market consensus of 1.0% rise, which matched December's print.

For 2024, China recorded a surplus of USD 992.16 billion, as exports grew 5.9% to USD 3.58 trillion, while imports rose at a more modest 1.1% to USD 2.59 trillion.

Despite the positive trade data, market sentiment remained dampened by persistent trade war concerns, with Beijing signaling its willingness to engage in ""any type of war"" and dismissing the U.S.' fentanyl-related rationale for imposing tariffs as a ""flimsy excuse.""

The Shanghai Composite struggled for clear direction on Friday but were both set to end the week with gains, and the offshore yuan edged lower to around 7.24 per dollar, extending its losses from the previous session as investors absorbed the latest economic data while remaining wary of escalating global trade tensions.

2025/3/7 6:30,Рубль тяготеет к снижению на форексе после значительного роста накануне,"МОСКВА, 7 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль утром пятницы тяготеет к
снижению против доллара и евро на внешних рынках после
значительного укрепления накануне, прервавшего череду неудачных
торговых сессий, а важным драйвером для российской валюты на
форексе остается внешнеполитическая новостная повестка.
    На внутреннем же рынке, помимо геополитики, влияние на
котировки сейчас оказывает баланс реальных денежных потоков,
складывающийся пока не в пользу продавцов инвалюты из-за
сезонности начала месяца и опасений за приток экспортной выручки
с учетом подешевевшей нефти, а также последствий западных
санкций против российской ""нефтянки"" и морских средств доставки
нефти из РФ.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 9.20 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 89,40, и рубль теряет 0,5% от уровней закрытия четверга, по
итогам которого российская валюта укрепилась на 1,6%, до этого
дешевея шесть дней подряд до двухнедельного минимума 90,40.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется по 96,23, и рубль
теряет 0,3% от закрытия четверга, по итогам которого российская
валюта также подорожала на 1,6%. В этой паре рубль дешевел пять
дней подряд, накануне утром достигнув трехнедельного минимума,
97,81.
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 12,22, и рубль котируется чуть лучше своих последних
показателей LSEG.
    Вчерашние же торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами
""завтра"" завершились на уровне 12,27 рубля за юань - российская
валюта в итоге потеряла 0,4% при минимальном за последние две
недели объеме сделок в 79 миллиардов рублей.
    Биржевой курс рубля в четверг отражал текущий набор
негативных факторов: низкий уровень нефтяных цен, сезонное
снижение активности экспортеров в первые дни календарного месяца
после уплаты корпоративных налогов и восстанавливающийся спрос
импортеров на инвалюту после традиционного спада в начале года.
    Но одновременно сохраняются надежды на смягчение санкций США
при позитивном развитии российско-американских отношений,
сигналы о котором исходят из Вашингтона и Москвы, и это
удерживало рубль от глубокой коррекции с достигнутых на прошлой
неделе многомесячных пиков и от полноценной реакции на динамику
нефтяного рынка.
    На форексе же российская валюта накануне выросла против всех
трех ключевых валют во многом за счет того, что внешние игроки
могут более оптимистично оценивать геополитические перспективы и
вновь заходить в рубль после нескольких дней его снижения, тем
более, что появились сообщения в прессе о возобновлении крупными
американскими банками торговли рублевыми деривативами на фоне
сигналов об улучшении отношений США и РФ.
    Внутренней поддержкой рублю остаются ежедневные
нетто-продажи китайской валюты Центробанком в рамках
зеркалирования трат из ФНБ и проведения операций по бюджетному
правилу. С сегодняшнего дня регулятор будет продавать юани
ежедневно на 5,96 миллиарда, что немного выше предыдущих
значений.
    Тем временем на внешних рынках нефть минимально дорожает.
Баррель Brent <LCOc1> подрастает на 0,1% и оценивается в $69,54,
при этом формируя худшую с середины октября неделю, в течение

2025/3/7 4:38,China's yuan inches lower as investors weigh tariff impact,"By Summer Zhen
       HONG KONG, March 7 (Reuters) - China's yuan eased
slightly against the dollar on Friday despite the pullback in
the greenback, as uncertainties surrounding U.S. tariffs and
their looming impact on China exports kept investors nervous. 
    China's exports lost momentum over the January-February
period and imports unexpectedly shrank, official data on Friday
shows, amid escalating trade tensions with the United States.
    Exports from the largest manufacturing nation rose just 2.3%
year-on-year, missing a growth forecast of 5% in a Reuters poll
of economists. Imports shrank 8.4%.
    As of 0323 GMT, the yuan <CNY=CFXS> was 0.08% lower at
7.2478 to the dollar after trading in a range of 7.2450 to
7.2535.
    The Trump administration doubled tariffs on all Chinese
imports to 20% this week, and Beijing quickly responded with
counter tariffs of 10-15% on certain U.S. imports. 
    Some analysts believe the recent stability of the yuan will
be short-lived given the yuan could face bigger risks if the
U.S. escalates trade tariffs and imposes more investment
restrictions.
    ""In Asia, CNY has been better behaved, but we still think
it's only a matter of time before the currency drops,"" Barclays
analysts said in a note on Friday, referring to the yuan's
vulnerability to tariffs and geopolitical swings. 
    ""The damage of higher US tariffs on China’s exports will
likely show up next month,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist
at Pinpoint Asset Management. 
    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China set
the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed
to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1705 per dollar, 701 pips firmer
than a Reuters' estimate. 
    The yuan is up 0.5% against the dollar this month, and 0.7%
firmer this year helped by the dollar's slump and support from
PBOC steering the daily midpoint higher and delaying monetary
easing, while positive sentiment towards China tech also eased
pressure.
    China's central bank Governor Pan Gongsheng on Thursday
reiterated the central bank will keep the yuan exchange rate
stable and will conduct more monetary policy easing ""at an
appropriate time.""
    Barclays analysts believe the government statement during 
this week's annual parliamentary session provided little support
to the yuan, given policymakers were mostly reiterating their
tone on fiscal and monetary policy.
    The offshore yuan traded at 7.2482 yuan per dollar <CNH=>,
down about 0.02% in Asian trade.

      关税重压下，人民币料以稳为主
    

  

       路透上海3月7日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周五早盘小幅低开后窄幅整理，中间价则小跌暂时脱离一个月高点，较路透预测偏离仍有700点。交易员表示，特朗普政府贸易政策反复无常加剧各方对美国经济前景的担忧，晚间公布的美国非农数据将为其经济增长是否降温提供指引。
    
    市场人士指出，美国暂缓对加、墨两国部分商品关税，但对华关税仍有进一步上调可能，人民币反弹乏力，后续料跟随美元小幅波动。中国海关最新公布的进出口数据弱于预期，对人民币汇率的直接影响相对有限。
    
    “美国非农可能不及预期，不过也不好说，如果数据很差，可能美元还能跌一些，但对人民币提振应该有限，”一外资行交易员称，关税影响已经很大了，人民币继续升值，出口企业会更难受。
    
    
    中国央行行长潘功胜周四在新闻会上表示，将坚持市场在汇率形成中的决定性作用，保持汇率弹性；强化预期引导，坚决防范汇率超调风险，保持人民币汇率在合理均衡水平上的基本稳定。
    
    中国海关总署周五公布，以美元计价1-2月出口同比增长2.3%，不及路透调查预估中值5%；进口同比转为下降8.4%，亦逊于路透调查预估中值的增长1%。
    
    隔夜欧洲央行一如预期在九个月内第六次降息，但上调近期通胀预期至2.3%后，欧元兑美元触及四个月最高。
    
    另外美国商务部长卢特尼克周四稍早表示，给予墨西哥和加拿大汽车产品为期一个月的关税暂缓很可能会扩大至所有符合《美墨加协定》(USMCA)的产品。而特朗普政府反复无常的贸易政策加剧市场动荡。
    
    经济学家警告称，关税不确定性可能会重新引发本已难以完全遏制的通胀，并进而导致需求和增长放缓。标普500指数收跌1.8%，自2月中旬以来已累跌近7%。
    
    
    全球汇市方面，美元周五在四个月低点附近徘徊，因为不断变化的关税政策加剧了不确定性，增加了人们对美国增长前景的担忧，使投资者急切地想从今天稍晚公布的就业数据研判前景。[FRX/CN]
        
    北京时间11:06，人民币兑美元<CNY=CFXS>即期报7.2486元，上日收报7.2428元，夜盘终报7.242元。今日人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>报7.1705元，上日为7.1692元。截至目前人民币即期成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为151.27亿美元。

2025/3/7 0:27,路透测算的人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>今日料开在7.2406元附近,"路透上海3月7日 - 路透根据中国外汇交易中心(CFETS)公布的人民币汇率形成机制测算，人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周五预计会开在7.2406元附近，较上日贬值约714点。
    
    特朗普发起全球贸易战加剧了美国经济放缓的担忧，欧洲央行如期降息，但上调近期通胀预期，美元<.DXY>探底四个月低点后暂时企稳，人民币的外部压力略有缓解，监管层料延续对中间价的过滤举措，寻求恢复弹性的时机。

    上日人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>收报7.2428元，而中间价则为7.1692元。根据定价机制，今日中间价变动中，有736点下跌反映市场供求影响，另有22点上涨反映的是隔夜一篮子汇率基本保持不变所需要的点数；“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。

    路透测算的上日人民币兑美元中间价为7.2386元，和外汇交易中心公布的实际值偏差694点。上日路透根据CFETS公布的中间价测算，人民币汇率CFETS指数、参考SDR（特别提款权）篮子指数和参考BIS(国际清算银行)篮子指数分别为99.22、93.18和105.25。

    上日(截至北京时间次日凌晨3点)人民币兑美元即期累计成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为464.78亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

2025/3/6 17:56,ActivTrades,"ActivTradesActivTrades, established in 2001 in Switzerland, has grown into a prominent online broker specializing in forex and Contracts for Difference (CFDs). Initially a stock brokerage, it relocated its headquarters to London in 2005 to capitalize on Europe's financial hub, expanding its offerings to include CFDs on indices, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. Today, ActivTrades serves over 30,000 active traders globally, with additional offices in Milan, Sofia, and Nassau, reflecting its robust international presence. The broker has earned a strong reputation for reliability, transparency, and innovation, bolstered by multiple industry awards, such as ""Best Online Trading Services"" at the ADVFN International Financial Awards.

ActivTrades operates under stringent regulatory oversight, ensuring client trust and security. Its primary entity, ActivTrades PLC, is regulated by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under license number 434413, a top-tier regulator known for its rigorous standards. Additional entities include ActivTrades Corp, regulated by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas (SCB, license 199667 B), and ActivTrades Europe S.A., overseen by Luxembourg's CSSF (license P00000491). These licenses underscore its commitment to compliance across jurisdictions. With over two decades in the industry, ActivTrades holds a competitive position in the forex and CFD market, appealing to both novice and seasoned traders through its advanced platforms and customer-centric services.

1. Introduction to ActivTrades

2. How to Register on ActivTrades

Registering with ActivTrades is a straightforward process designed for efficiency and security. Begin by visiting the official website (activtrades.com) and clicking ""Open an Account."" You'll be prompted to select your account type (e.g., individual or professional) and provide basic personal details: full name, email address, phone number, and country of residence. Next, choose your preferred trading platform (e.g., MetaTrader 5 or ActivTrader) and account currency (EUR, USD, GBP, or CHF).

The Know Your Customer (KYC) process follows, requiring identity verification to comply with regulatory standards. You'll need to upload a government-issued ID (passport, driver's license, or national ID card) and proof of address (e.g., a utility bill or bank statement dated within the last three months). For professional accounts, additional documentation proving trading experience or financial status may be requested. The online form also includes questions about your trading experience, employment status, and financial background to assess suitability. Once submitted, verification typically takes 24 hours, though it may extend slightly during peak times. Upon approval, you'll receive login credentials via email, granting access to your trading account.

3. ActivTrades Login Process

After registration, logging into ActivTrades is simple. Visit the website or open your chosen trading platform (e.g., MetaTrader 4, MetaTrader 5, or ActivTrader). Enter your registered email address or account number and the password provided during setup. For mobile app users, the process mirrors the desktop experience―download the app from the App Store or Google Play, input your credentials, and log in. First-time users may need to reset their temporary password via an email link.

Common login issues include forgotten passwords, easily resolved by selecting ""Forgot Password"" and following the reset prompts. Incorrect account numbers or platform mismatches (e.g., using MT4 credentials on MT5) can also occur; double-check your details or contact support. Slow internet connections may delay login―ensure a stable network. ActivTrades employs two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security, requiring a code sent to your phone or email, so keep your registered devices accessible. If locked out after multiple failed attempts, wait 15 minutes or reach out to customer support for assistance.

4. Available Account Types

ActivTrades offers a variety of account types tailored to different trader profiles. The Individual Account suits most retail traders, featuring leverage up to 1:30 (per ESMA regulations), no minimum deposit (except $500 for Brazil and China), and access to all platforms and assets. The Professional Account targets experienced traders, offering leverage up to 1:400, tighter spreads, and zero-fee CFD share trading with 1:1 leverage, but requires proof of significant trading experience or financial qualifications. The Islamic Account, swap-free and Sharia-compliant, caters to Muslim traders, maintaining the same features as the Individual Account without overnight fees.

The Corporate Account supports businesses or institutional clients, with customized solutions and higher deposit thresholds, though specifics vary by agreement. Each account type provides negative balance protection and access to over 1,000 CFDs, but differs in leverage, fees, and eligibility. Professional accounts demand a higher risk tolerance and expertise, while Individual and Islamic accounts prioritize accessibility. Demo accounts are also available across all types for practice, requiring no deposit. Traders should assess their experience and goals when choosing, as perks like higher leverage come with increased risk.

5. Demo Account Availability

ActivTrades provides a robust demo account, ideal for testing strategies risk-free. Available to all users, it mirrors live market conditions with virtual funds, offering access to forex, CFDs, and all supported platforms (MT4, MT5, ActivTrader, and TradingView). To open one, visit the website, select ""Demo Account,"" and fill out a brief form with your name, email, and preferred platform. No deposit or full registration is required for an initial 72-hour trial, a unique feature in the industry. For extended use, complete the standard registration process, and the demo remains active indefinitely.

The demo account features real-time quotes, customizable leverage, and the full suite of trading tools, allowing users to practice scalping, hedging, or automated trading. It's particularly valuable for beginners learning platform navigation or seasoned traders testing new strategies. Unlike some brokers, ActivTrades doesn't limit demo functionality, ensuring an authentic experience. To switch to a live account, simply fund your profile after mastering the demo. This offering enhances ActivTrades' appeal for skill-building without financial commitment.

6. Trading Platform Overview

ActivTrades offers a versatile suite of trading platforms catering to diverse preferences. The web-based ActivTrader, powered by TradingView charts, boasts an intuitive interface with advanced charting, over 90 indicators, and customizable layouts, ideal for beginners and intermediate traders. However, it lacks some advanced features of desktop alternatives. MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader 5 (MT5), available for desktop download, are industry standards favored by experienced traders. MT4 offers 50+ indicators and robust automation via Expert Advisors (EAs), while MT5 adds deeper market insights, more order types, and an economic calendar―both support Windows and Mac.

The mobile apps for ActivTrader, MT4, and MT5 (iOS and Android) ensure seamless trading on the go, mirroring desktop functionality with real-time quotes, one-tap execution, and charting tools. Customization options include adjustable leverage and watchlists, though the mobile UI can feel cramped on smaller screens. ActivTrades enhances MT platforms with proprietary add-ons like SmartOrder and SmartLines, improving order execution and risk management. While the platforms excel in usability and tools, the ActivTrader desktop version offers fewer customization options compared to MT5, potentially limiting advanced traders.

7. Markets and Assets Available

ActivTrades specializes in CFD trading, offering over 1,000 instruments across multiple markets. Forex includes 50+ currency pairs, from majors like EUR/USD to exotics like USD/CNH, with tight spreads starting at 0.5 pips. Commodities cover 20+ assets, including gold, silver, and oil, providing diversification opportunities. Indices feature 19 global options like the S&P 500 and FTSE 100, appealing to macro-focused traders. Cryptocurrency CFDs (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) are available under the Bahamas entity, with up to 1:20 leverage, though not offered in the UK due to FCA restrictions.

Stocks CFDs encompass around 1,000 companies, including Apple, Tesla, and BP, across US, UK, and European markets, but real stocks, bonds, ETFs, options, and fractional shares are absent, limiting traditional investment options. This CFD-centric focus suits short-term traders but may disappoint long-term investors. Popular assets like EUR/USD, gold, and Bitcoin attract significant volume, supported by fast execution and competitive pricing. The asset range, while robust for CFDs, lacks the breadth of multi-asset brokers like Interactive Brokers.

8. Fees and Commissions

ActivTrades' fee structure is competitive, with trading costs primarily driven by spreads rather than commissions on most accounts. Forex spreads start at 0.5 pips for majors like EUR/USD, slightly below the industry average of 0.7-1.0 pips, while exotic pairs may widen during volatility. CFDs on indices (e.g., S&P 500) average 0.5-1 point, and commodities like gold hover around 0.25 pips―cost-effective for active traders. Overnight (swap) fees apply to positions held past 5 PM EST, varying by asset and leverage, with rates disclosed transparently on the website.

Non-trading fees include a $10 monthly inactivity fee after 12 months of dormancy, aligning with industry norms. Deposits are free, but withdrawals via bank transfer incur a $9 fee for amounts under $100; e-wallets and cards are typically fee-free. Currency conversion fees (around 0.5%) apply if your account currency differs from the transaction, a standard charge but notable for multi-currency traders. Compared to peers like FxPro or Admirals, ActivTrades offers lower spreads and no commission on standard accounts, though its inactivity fee and conversion costs could add up for less active users.

9. Deposit and Withdrawal Methods

ActivTrades supports diverse deposit options: bank transfers, debit/credit cards (Visa, Mastercard), and e-wallets like Neteller, Skrill, and PayPal (availability varies by region). There's no minimum deposit for most regions, though Brazil and China require $500. Deposits are processed instantly for cards and e-wallets, while bank transfers take 1-3 business days. No fees are charged, enhancing cost efficiency.

Withdrawals follow a similar process―submit a request via the client portal, with processing completed same-day if submitted before 12:30 PM GMT, otherwise next day. Bank transfers take 1-3 days, e-wallets and cards are faster (often within hours), but a $9 fee applies to bank withdrawals under $100. Limits are flexible, with no strict caps, though large transactions may require additional verification. Cryptocurrency payments are unsupported due to regulatory constraints, a minor drawback compared to some competitors. Overall, the process is efficient and transparent, though withdrawal fees for small amounts could deter casual traders.

10. Bonuses and Promotions

As of March 2025, ActivTrades offers limited bonuses due to strict regulatory oversight, particularly under FCA rules banning incentives for retail clients. However, its Bahamas entity occasionally provides promotions, such as a welcome bonus (e.g., 10% deposit match up to $500) for new traders depositing $100+, subject to trading volume requirements (e.g., 10 lots within 90 days). Terms are clear: bonuses are non-withdrawable, and failure to meet conditions voids the offer. Always check the website for current offers, as they vary by region.

The Affiliate Program stands out, offering up to $1,350 CPA per referred client who deposits $100 and generates $40 in spreads within 180 days, with no commission cap and robust marketing tools via CELLXPERT. Loyalty schemes are absent, but high-volume traders may negotiate rebates informally. While promotional offerings are modest compared to offshore brokers, the focus on regulation ensures fairness, appealing to cautious traders over bonus hunters.

11. Trading Tools and Features

ActivTrades equips traders with a solid toolkit. Charting tools, powered by TradingView on ActivTrader and enhanced on MT4/MT5, include over 90 technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) and 14+ chart types for in-depth analysis. The economic calendar tracks global events, aiding fundamental traders, while the Market Sentiment indicator gauges crowd behavior. Proprietary tools like SmartOrder (fast execution) and SmartLines (automated trade triggers) enhance MT platforms, though historical data access is limited.

Supported order types include market, limit, stop-loss, and trailing stop, with ActivTrader's Progressive Trailing Stop dynamically adjusting to price targets―a standout feature. Hedging and scalping are permitted, and EAs on MT4/MT5 support automation. While not as extensive as some rivals (e.g., Thinkorswim's 400+ indicators), the tools strike a balance between accessibility and sophistication, suiting most trading styles effectively.

12. Leverage and Margin Requirements

ActivTrades offers leverage up to 1:30 for retail clients under FCA/ESMA rules, with professional accounts reaching 1:400 upon qualification (e.g., significant trading history or $500,000 portfolio). Forex majors typically allow 1:30, while cryptocurrencies cap at 1:20 under the Bahamas entity. Margin requirements vary―3.33% for 1:30 leverage, dropping to 0.25% at 1:400―calculated as a percentage of the position's notional value. Margin calls trigger at 100% (full margin used), with stop-out at 50%, closing positions to prevent negative balances.

High leverage amplifies gains but magnifies losses; a $1,000 position at 1:400 could wipe out with a 0.25% adverse move. Negative balance protection mitigates this risk, but traders must exercise caution. Compared to offshore brokers offering 1:1000+, ActivTrades' caps reflect regulatory prudence, balancing opportunity and safety.

13. Educational Resources

ActivTrades provides a comprehensive educational suite for all skill levels. Beginner guides cover forex basics, CFD mechanics, and risk management, written in clear, actionable language. Live webinars, hosted weekly by experts, delve into technical analysis, market trends, and platform use, with recordings available on-demand. Video tutorials span platform navigation, order types, and strategy development, averaging 5-10 minutes for digestibility.

Daily market analysis and commentary on forex, indices, and commodities offer actionable insights, though depth varies―some reports lack the granularity of competitors like IG. The quality is high, with practical examples and multilingual support, but the absence of structured courses or certification limits advanced learning. For beginners and intermediates, these resources build confidence and competence effectively.

14. Social and Copy Trading

ActivTrades does not offer social or copy trading as of March 2025, focusing instead on direct trading platforms like MT4, MT5, and ActivTrader. Unlike competitors such as eToro or Vantage, which integrate social features to mimic expert trades or share strategies, ActivTrades prioritizes individual control and proprietary tools. This omission reflects its regulatory stance and target audience―self-directed traders over passive investors.

While MT4/MT5 support signal services via third-party providers (e.g., MQL5 community), this isn't broker-integrated copy trading. Traders seeking social interaction or automated portfolio mirroring may find this a drawback, though the broker's robust toolkit compensates for active, hands-on users.

15. Customer Support

ActivTrades offers 24/5 customer support via live chat, email (support@activtrades.com), and phone (+44 207 6500 567), aligning with forex market hours (Monday 00:00 to Friday 23:59 GMT). Multilingual assistance in 14 languages, including English, Spanish, and Mandarin, ensures global accessibility. Live chat responses average under 2 minutes, with knowledgeable agents addressing account, platform, and withdrawal queries efficiently. Email replies typically arrive within 24 hours, while phone support offers immediate resolution for urgent issues.

User feedback praises responsiveness and professionalism, though weekend unavailability (common in the industry) frustrates some. Compared to 24/7 brokers like Pepperstone, ActivTrades' support is robust but not round-the-clock. For most traders, the quality and speed suffice, especially during peak trading times.

16. Safety, Security, and Regulation

ActivTrades is regulated by top-tier authorities: FCA (434413) in the UK, SCB (199667 B) in the Bahamas, and CSSF (P00000491) in Luxembourg, with additional oversight from Portugal's CMVM and Brazil's CVM. Client funds are held in segregated accounts at Tier-1 banks, separate from company assets, ensuring protection in case of insolvency. The FCA's Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) covers up to ?85,000 for UK clients, while ActivTrades enhances this with private insurance from Lloyd's of London up to $1 million per client―a rare perk.

Security features include 2FA via SMS or email, SSL encryption for data transmission, and regular audits. Negative balance protection prevents debt, aligning with ESMA rules. This multi-layered approach makes ActivTrades a standout for safety-conscious traders, surpassing many peers in fund protection.

17. Pros and Cons of ActivTrades

Pros: ActivTrades excels with tight spreads (from 0.5 pips), no deposit fees, and a wide range of CFDs (1,000+ instruments). Its top-tier regulation (FCA, SCB) and $1 million insurance bolster trust, while MT4/MT5 and ActivTrader platforms cater to diverse needs. Fast execution, negative balance protection, and a feature-rich demo account enhance its appeal.

Cons: The broker's CFD-only focus excludes real stocks, bonds, and ETFs, limiting long-term investors. Customer support lacks weekend availability, and an inactivity fee ($10/month) may irk dormant users. Currency conversion fees and a narrow base currency range (EUR, USD, GBP, CHF) add minor costs. The absence of social/copy trading disappoints passive traders.

18. Comparison with Other Brokers

Compared to FxPro, ActivTrades offers lower forex spreads (0.5 vs. 0.6 pips) and no commission on standard accounts, though FxPro includes cTrader and more base currencies. Admirals provides a broader asset range (stocks, ETFs) and lower inactivity fees ($6 vs. $10), but its spreads are wider (0.7 pips). Interactive Brokers dwarfs ActivTrades in scope (150+ markets, real stocks), yet its fees are higher (e.g., $0.005/share commissions) and platforms less beginner-friendly.

ActivTrades shines in regulatory strength and platform simplicity, ideal for forex/CFD traders, but lags in asset diversity and passive trading options compared to these multi-asset giants.

19. User Reviews and Ratings

On Trustpilot (March 2025), ActivTrades holds a 4.3/5 rating from 1,373 reviews, with users praising fast execution, competitive spreads, and reliable support. Forex Peace Army scores it 3.8/5, commending platform stability and fund safety. Google Reviews echo this at 4.2/5, highlighting educational tools. Common praise centers on transparency, low costs, and regulatory trust.

Frequent complaints include slow withdrawal times (1-3 days vs. promised same-day), mediocre weekend support absence, and limited asset variety. Some note currency conversion fees as a hidden cost. Overall, feedback is positive, with gripes typical of regulated brokers balancing compliance and service.

20. Platform Availability by Country

ActivTrades operates in over 140 countries, including the UK, EU nations (e.g., Germany, Italy), Australia, South America, and Southeast Asia. Offices in London, Milan, Sofia, and Nassau support its global reach. It caters to diverse regions with multilingual platforms and support. However, it's unavailable in the US, Canada, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea due to regulatory restrictions or sanctions. Brazil and China require a $500 minimum deposit, reflecting local compliance. Traders should verify availability via the website, as regional entities (e.g., Bahamas vs. UK) affect leverage and asset access.

21. Taxation and Declaring Profits

Taxation on ActivTrades profits depends on your country's laws―e.g., UK traders report CFD gains as capital gains (10-20% rate), while US traders (if eligible via offshore entities) face income tax (up to 37%). ActivTrades doesn't withhold taxes, leaving declaration to the trader. It provides no formal tax statements, but transaction histories and profit/loss reports are downloadable from the client portal for tax filings. Consult a local tax professional, as CFDs' non-ownership status often complicates classification (e.g., speculative income vs. investment gains). Record-keeping is key, and ActivTrades' tools support this, though direct tax assistance is absent.

22. Common Issues and How to Solve Them

Login Problems: Forgotten passwords or 2FA issues arise―reset via ""Forgot Password"" or contact support with your registered email. Withdrawal Delays: Processing can lag beyond same-day promises―ensure requests are before 12:30 PM GMT and verify bank details; escalate to support if over 3 days. Verification Troubles: Rejected KYC documents (e.g., blurry IDs) stall setup―resubmit clear, valid copies matching your application. Platform Bugs: Lagging charts or execution errors occur―clear cache, update software, or switch devices; report persistent issues to tech support. Proactive communication with ActivTrades resolves most hiccups efficiently.

23. Final Verdict

ActivTrades blends regulatory rigor, competitive pricing, and versatile platforms, making it a strong choice for forex and CFD traders. Strengths include tight spreads, top-tier regulation (FCA, SCB), and a $1 million insurance safety net, alongside robust MT4/MT5 tools and a solid demo account. Weaknesses―limited assets (no real stocks/ETFs), no social trading, and weekend support gaps―curb its appeal for passive or multi-asset investors. It's best for active traders valuing safety and cost-efficiency, from beginners mastering forex to pros leveraging high-volume CFDs. Long-term investors or copy-trading enthusiasts may prefer broader platforms like eToro or Interactive Brokers.

24. FAQs

 1.  Is ActivTrades regulated? Yes, by the FCA (434413), SCB (199667 B), CSSF (P00000491), and others.
 2.  What's the minimum deposit? $0 globally, $500 in Brazil/China.

2025/3/6 14:46,BUZZ-FX options wrap - NFP threat dominates already high risk premiums,"Volatility has become the only constant in FX, creating ideal conditions for
options to thrive. It's no surprise, then, that implied volatility has surged to
extremes across many pairs - especially in overnight expiries factoring in
Friday's key U.S. jobs data. 
    With the USD already under broad-based pressure, a weaker-than-expected set
of U.S. jobs data could further undermine it. Overnight expiry implied
volatility in the majority of the USD versus major currencies trades new 2025
highs. 
    EUR/USD option demand was at the fore this week as Germany's debt increase
reignited demand for EUR. EUR/USD implied volatility reached mid-January highs
and sub-3-month risk reversals flipped premium from USD calls to puts and their
highest topside bias since 2020. EUR/USD traded volumes reached 2025 highs
mid-week with an onus on topside strikes between 1.0800 and 1.1000 - the first
level having since been achieved.
    USD/JPY implied volatility extends 2025 highs and the downside-over-upside
strike premium on risk reversals trades new highs since late 2024. Gains come
amid consistent demand for JPY call strikes as USD/JPY extends losses to new
lows since October at 147.31. The recent addition to existing knock-out triggers
and barriers suggests 145.00 could be a tough level to crack.

динамики нефтяных цен за последние недели, а также из-за
последствий западных санкций в отношении российской ""нефтянки"" и
танкерного флота РФ. 
    Одновременно сохраняются надежды на смягчение санкций при
позитивном развитии российско-американских отношений, сигналы о
котором исходят из Вашингтона и Москвы, и это удерживает рубль
от глубокой коррекции с достигнутых на прошлой неделе
многомесячных пиков и от полноценной реакции на динамику

    ""Любой геополитический позитив способен вызвать рост рубля

2025/3/6 12:26,BUZZ-COMMENT-FX options warn of extreme NFP volatility risk,"March 6 (Reuters) - FX volatility is a key yet unknown parameter of an
FX option premium, so dealers use implied volatility as a stand-in. Overnight
expiry now includes Friday's key U.S. monthly employment data and its implied
volatility has jumped to the highest levels this year.
    Shorter-dated expiry implied volatility was already elevated amid the recent
USD decline, especially versus the EUR where the German debt/spending increase
has boosted the EUR this week. However, the jobs data adds another level of
uncertainty and volatility risk to the already ailing USD, which could extend
losses on a weak number. 
    Overnight expiry USD/JPY implied volatility reached 22.00 - a
premium/break-even for a simple vanilla straddle of 136 JPY pips in either
direction. This compares with an average implied volatility around 14.0 or 86
JPY pips over recent weeks. 
    Overnight expiry EUR/USD implied volatility reached 20.0 - a
premium/break-even of 90 USD pips in either direction. It peaked at 15.0 or 67
USD pips amid Wednesday's broader implied volatility spike when it also included
the European Central Bank policy decision. It was trading as low at 9.0 or 40
USD pips last week. 
    Overnight AUD/USD implied volatility has reached 14.5 or 39 USD pips in
either direction since including the U.S. jobs data. That's up from 10.0 or 26
USD pips on Wednesday and lows nearer 8.0 or 21 USD pips last week.

2025/3/6 10:42,BUZZ-COMMENT-Volatility is now the only FX constant and where options thrive,"March 6 (Reuters) - FX options thrive on FX volatility which is now
abundant due to shifting trade tariffs, growth outlooks, inflation and
ultimately - monetary policy.
    Options can capture volatility in any direction when paired with an opposing
cash hedge, eliminating currency risk. As the spot market moves, the hedge is
adjusted to maintain neutral exposure―typically once daily, but more frequently
for short-dated expiries. This dynamic often pulls the spot market toward large,
soon-to-expire FX option strikes, which is why it's useful to know in advance
where they reside. 
    The buyer of an option gains the right to buy or sell a chosen currency pair
at a predetermined strike price and expiry date. The premium they pay depends on
factors such as time to expiry, the strike's distance from the current spot
price, deposit rates, and currency forwards. However, volatility is a crucial
yet uncertain factor―making implied volatility a key substitute in pricing.
     If actual volatility exceeds implied volatility and/or implied volatility
rises, the option's value can increase. This dynamic has realised big profits
for EUR/USD FX option holders amid the recent spot and implied volatility gains.
    If spot volatility declines, implied volatility should follow. However,
given the current FX landscape, overall losses may be limited as the risk-reward
profile of holding options remains appealing.

2025/3/6 9:02,Юань откатился от пика 4мес - облегчение по поводу ситуации с пошлинами меркнет,"ШАНХАЙ, 6 мар (Рейтер) - Китайский юань отступил от
максимума четырех месяцев в паре с долларом, поскольку
сохраняющиеся опасения о потенциальных новых американских
пошлинах в США на импорт из КНР перевесили облегчение от
отсрочки тарифов для автопроизводителей из Канады и Мексики.
    Доллар снизился к большинству основных валют накануне на
фоне сообщения Белого дома о том, что президент США Дональд
Трамп освободит автопроизводителей от 25-процентной пошлины на
импорт из Канады и Мексики на один месяц при условии соблюдения
ими действующих правил свободной торговли.
    По словам участников рынка, в целом настроения в отношении
юаня остаются сдержанным, несмотря на рост накануне.
    Влияние отступления доллара на юань будет ограниченным,
считает Кен Чунг из Mizuho.
    ""Поразительная стабильность юаня после нескольких раундов
повышения американских тарифов на 10% может застать участников
рынка врасплох"", ― сказал Чунг.
    ""Неопределенность вокруг пошлин Трампа вряд ли исчезнет до
начала торговых переговоров между Китаем и США, из-за чего курс
юаня на материковом и офшорном рынках останется выше отметки

    Спотовый юань в Китайской системе валютной торговли SFETS на
материковом рынке <CNY=CFXS> к 10:33 МСК снизился на 0,08%
до? 7,2403?, а на офшорном рынке <CNH=> был малоподвижен на
уровне 7,2404. 
   Перед открытием сессии ЦБ Китая объявил срединный
фиксированный курс <CNY=PBOC> на уровне 7,1692 за доллар. При
этом значение оказалось на 694 pips (десятитысячных долей
процентного пункта) сильнее приведенного Рейтер прогноза
аналитиков.
    Между тем на начавшейся в среду сессии Всекитайского
собрания народных представителей чиновники сигнализировали о
намерении активизировать поддержку потребления для защиты
экономического роста.
    ""Хотя риск рефляции в США может замедлить или даже
остановить снижение ставок ФРС, реализация пакета стимулов (в
Китае), улучшение экономической динамики и стабильно высокое

 (新增评论及收盘报价)
       路透上海/北京3月6日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周四收创近一个半月新高；
中间价亦续升22点触一个月高点，和较路透预测偏离收窄至约700点。交易员表示，欧元强
势反弹加剧美元指数<.DXY>跌势，助力人民币反弹，不过关税重压下市场情绪仍相对谨慎。
    
    他们并指出，市场关注欧元强劲表现，而美元在特朗普关税政策反复中遭到抛售，接下
来重点关注晚间欧洲央行政策决议以及周五美国非农数据和市场主流预期是否相符。
    
    “美元/人民币的波动中枢会下移一些，但本身人民币缺乏升值的逻辑，负carry情况下
也没法长期拿，”一外资行交易员称，“先看看明天非农，如果数据还是弱，估计美元还能
再下一些。”
    
    另一外资行交易员也表示，目前人民币反弹更多是跟随性质，市场情绪似乎仍显谨慎。
    
    
        瑞穗银行亚洲首席策略师张建泰点评指出，特朗普关税不确定性不太可能在中美贸
易谈判开始前消散，这将令人民币汇率维持在7.2上方波动，美元指数下跌对人民币的提振
可能相对有限。
    
    中国央行行长潘功胜今日在发布会上表示，将坚持市场在汇率形成中的决定性作用，保
持汇率弹性；强化预期引导，坚决防范汇率超调风险，保持人民币汇率在合理均衡水平上的
基本稳定。
    
    北欧斯安银行(SEB)亚洲战略主管Eugenia Victorino认为，当前美国对华商品的平均关
税已超30%，人民币仍需进一步贬值以缓解关税的冲击。预计“人民币需要贬至7.65才能抵
消2月份征收的首批10%关税的影响。”不过近期美元疲软也帮助人民币小幅反弹。
    
    Monex USA 交易主管Juan Perez称，“如果事情朝着限制性保护主义的方向发展，金融
体系就会开始做出调整，现在看来抛售美元头寸是明智之举。如果关税和贸易战被认为对美
国经济不利，我们就会回到对宽松货币政策可能性的猜测。”
    
    欧元本周上涨了4.3%，有望创下2009年3月以来的最佳周度表现，不过今日稍晚的欧洲
央行政策决定将备受关注。市场普遍预期该央行将降息25个基点，但焦点将集中在此后的政
策宽松范围和速度方面。
    
    全球汇市方面，欧元兑美元周四继续刷新四个月高点，此前德国提出建立5,000亿欧元
（约合5,398.5亿美元）基础设施基金并改革借贷规则，推动欧元区公债收益率飙升。[FRX/

2025/3/6 8:26,Asia stocks rise as Trump postpones auto tariffs; HK shares soar on China stimulus,"Asia stocks rise as Trump postpones auto tariffs; HK shares soar on China stimulusAsia-Pacific markets saw widespread gains Thursday, buoyed by Trump's delayed auto tariffs and China's stimulus, mirroring positive global market sentiment.

Caution also built ahead of the release of Chinese trade data on Friday, amid escalating trade tensions with the US.

Japan (NKY:IND) rose 0.87% to surpass 37,800, while the broader Topix Index gained 1% to 2,745 on Thursday, marking a second consecutive session of gains. The Japanese yen traded near 149 per dollar on Thursday, staying close to its strongest levels in five months.

China (SHCOMP) rose 1.18% to surpass 3,370, while the Shenzhen Component gained 1.1% to 10,827 on Thursday, marking a third consecutive session of gains, and the offshore yuan

Mainland stocks rallied after US President Donald Trump granted tariff concessions for certain automakers, raising optimism for potential trade relief.

Traders keenly added new positions after China projected a 5% GDP growth for 2025 during a parliamentary session, keeping the same forecast as 2024 despite trade tensions with the US. Moreover, Beijing announced plans to issue CNY 1.3 trillion in ultra-long special treasury bonds to boost demand and support infrastructure projects.

Hong Kong (HSI) rose 2.84% to 24,115 in Thursday morning deals, marking the third session of gains while reaching their highest level in over three years.

India (SENSEX) rose 0.05% was almost flat, trading around 73,786 in morning trade on Thursday in volatile conditions, after surging in the previous session.

Australia (AS51) fell 0.57% dropped 0.57% to close at 8,095 on Thursday, marking its lowest level in ten weeks, driven by significant losses in energy, consumer, and technology stocks. The Australian dollar rose above $0.634 on Thursday, reaching a one-week high after data revealed that Australia's trade balance exceeded expectations in January, driven by accelerated export growth and a decline in imports.

Australia's goods exports grew 1.3% from the previous month to an eleven-month high of AUD 44.53 billion in January 2025. Australia's imports of goods fell by 0.3% month-over-month to AUD 38.91 billion in January 2025, shifting from a surge of 5.9% in the previous month.

Private house approvals in Australia rose by 1.1% month-on-month to 9,042 units in January 2025.

South Korea's inflation rate eased to 2% in February 2025, down from a six-month high of 2.2% in January. However, it came in higher than market expectations of 1.95%.

In the U.S., on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended higher in the wake of President Trump's announcement of a one-month exemption on auto tariffs for Mexico and Canada.

U.S. stock futures remained stable on Thursday, following a rebound in major averages in the previous session: Dow -0.07%; S&P 500 -0.15%; Nasdaq -0.29%.

On the data front, traders are closely watching Friday's monthly jobs report after ADP data revealed that the US private sector added just 77,000 jobs in February, the smallest increase in seven months.

Currencies: (JPY:USD), (CNY:USD), (AUD:USD), (INR:USD), (HKD:USD), (NZD:USD).

2025/3/6 7:25,人民币衍生品：境内美元/人民币长端掉期触四个半月新高，套利需求依旧旺盛,"路透上海3月6日 - 跨月后中国央行在公开市场连续净回笼，银行间市场资金面从周初的偏松转向平稳，而境内美元流动性则持续充裕，美元/人民币短端掉期<CNYTN=CFXS>略有回落；交易员称，中国“两会”期间短端掉期或持稳，后续需关注银行间流动性会否再度偏紧。
    
    交易员并表示，本周美债收益率探底回升，中美负利差略有走扩，不过本周美元明显调整，人民币即期的外部压力小幅缓解，而套利需求仍较旺盛，掉期本周多次升破-2,000点关口，周四盘中短暂升至-1,990点，创四个半月新高。
    
    “预计长端还是区间波动，年初到现在涨幅不小了，再往上似乎有点难了，”一外资行交易员称。
    
    
    
    另一外资行交易员则称，如果美元继续调整，市场供需可能失衡，长端掉期或继续向利率平价收敛。
    
    建行金融市场部最新观点认为，“两会”期间出于维稳需要，银行间资金利率中枢继续抬升的可能性不大，但中国央行仍有稳汇率的必要，短期内降准降息概率较低；后续需关注央行是否加大公开市场流动性投放，增加买断式逆回购操作规模，及重启国债买入操作等。
    
    财通证券宏观团队表示，预计3月流动性缺口约2,600亿元，资金面存在一定的压力；在政府债供给放量阶段，央行或主要通过买断式逆回购补充中长期流动性投放，汇率压力缓解后央行或将重启国债买入，届时资金中枢有望回落，尤其是短债利率和短期限存单利率。
    
    从外部环境看，特朗普在关税问题上态度反复，美国经济增长有放缓迹象，而欧洲经济增长前景有所改善，欧元顺势反弹也加剧了美元的弱势，部分抵消特朗普对华关税上调的影响。
    
    Monex USA 交易主管Juan Perez称，“如果事情朝着限制性保护主义的方向发展，金融体系就会开始做出调整，现在看来抛售美元头寸是明智之举。如果关税和贸易战被认为对美国经济不利，我们就会回到对宽松货币政策可能性的猜测。”
    
    根据芝商所的FedWatch工具，对美联储在5月初的会议上减息的预期在周二短暂攀升至50%以上，尾盘为40%，高于一周前的约28%；另外市场还预计美联储今年降息69个基点，高于此前降息不到50个基点的押注。
    
    
    北京时间15:00，境内美元/人民币隔夜期掉期<CNYON=CFXA>报-5.19点，一周期掉期<CNYSW=CFXA>报-35点，一个月期<CNY1M=CFXA>报-153.5点，一年期<CNY1Y=CFXA>报-2,012点，上周五收盘四个期限掉期点分别收在-9.7点、-33点、-160点和-2,025点。

    根据利率平价模型，多数情况下美元/人民币掉期点与中美利差正相关，即当中美利差扩大时，美元/人民币掉期点相应上涨，反之亦然；其中一年期掉期走势是美元/人民币掉期市场的重要标杆。（完）

2025/3/6 6:48,Рубль растет к доллару и достиг минимума 3 нед к евро с оглядкой на FX,"МОСКВА, 6 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль утром четверга дорожает
против доллара и дешевеет к евро, отражая текущую динамику этих
валют на форексе в отсутствие пока явных сигналов по изменению
геополитической повестки.
    После открытия спотовых валютных торгов Мосбиржи влияние на
котировки рубля будут оказывать реальные денежные потоки, при
этом участники рынка начинают опасаются за приток экспортной
выручки с учетом сформировавшегося за последнее время
относительно низкого уровня нефтяных цен и также последствий
западных санкций в отношении российской ""нефтянки"" и против
морских средств доставки нефти из РФ.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 9.45 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 89,85, и рубль набирает 0,6% от уровней закрытия среды, по
итогам которой он потерял 0,7%.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется по 97,69, и рубль
теряет 0,2% от закрытия среды, по итогам которой российская
валюта подешевела на 2,3%. Ранее сегодня рублем был достигнут
трехнедельный минимум по отношению к европейской валюте, отметка
97,81.
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 12,23, вблизи от последних вчерашних показателей LSEG.
    На форексе индекс доллара сегодня утром снижался до уровня
104,09 <=USD> впервые за четыре месяца, а его потери с начала
текущей недели превышают три процента. Пара евро/доллар растет
на 0,2% и котируется по $1,0814 <EUR=>, ранее отметившись на
максимуме с 7 ноября, $1,0820. Доллар лихорадит на фоне торговой
войны США с ключевыми партнерами и переменчивых
внешнеэкономических решений администрации Дональда Трампа,
усиливающих неопределенность в глобальной торговле и таящих
риски для американской экономики. Евро растет на фоне скачка
доходности европейских госбумаг на фоне смягчения Германией
своих ограничений на заимствования. 
    Вчерашние же торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами
""завтра"" завершились на уровне 12,23 рубля за юань - российская
валюта в итоге потеряла 0,6% при объеме сделок в 104 миллиарда
рублей. В течение торгов
    Рубль в среду подешевел на Мосбирже с учетом сезонного
снижения предложения экспортной выручки в начале календарного
месяца после уплаты корпоративных налогов, а также с оглядкой на
падение нефти, что вкупе вновь перевесило поддержку в целом
позитивной вчерашней внешнеполитической новостной повестки.
    Против рубля сейчас может играть также восстанавливающийся
после традиционного спада в начале года спрос импортеров на
инвалюту.
    Внешним риском для рубля остается динамика нефтяных цен.
Североморская смесь Brent <LCOc1> накануне дешевела до 68,33 за
баррель впервые с декабря 2021 года, а торги среды завершились
под отметкой $70 впервые с начала прошлой осени. Сейчас баррель
Brent оценивается в $69,75 (+0,7%).
    Спотовые европейские котировки российской нефтяной смеси
Urals к закрытию среды находились в пределах отметок
$57,77-$62,01 за баррель <URL-E> >URL-NWE=E>, потеряв за сессию
более трех процентов.
    Перманентной локальной поддержкой рублю остаются
нетто-продажи китайской валюты Центробанком в рамках
зеркалирования трат из ФНБ и проведения операций по бюджетному
правилу. С завтрашнего дня регулятор немного нарастит объем
продаж юаней, до 5,96 миллиарда рублей в день с текущих 5,56
миллиарда.

2025/3/6 6:22,ИСПРАВЛЕНО-Рубль в среду отметился на минимумах 2 недель из-за сезонности и нефти,"(В первом абзаце следует читать ""свежие многомесячные минимумы
нефти"" вместо ""свежие многомесячные максимумы"")
       МОСКВА, 5 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль в среду показывал в
основном негативную динамику, и вновь с учетом сезонного
снижения предложения экспортной выручки в начале календарного
месяца, а также с оглядкой на свежие многомесячные минимумы
нефти, что вкупе вновь перевесило поддержку в целом позитивной
внешнеполитической новостной повестки.
    При этом незначительный, до 5,96 миллиарда рублей в день с
5,56 миллиарда, рост мартовских нетто-продаж китайской валюты
Центробанком в рамках зеркалирования трат из ФНБ и проведения
операций по бюджетному правилу сегодня не оказал влияния на
динамику рубля, хотя формально это играет на стороне российской
валюты.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 17.50 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 12,23, и российская валюта
теряет 0,6%, днем достигнув двухнедельного минимума 12,35.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к 17.50 МСК
котировались вблизи отметок 12,25, 90,10 и 96,40 соответственно,
и рубль теряет 0,6% к юаню, 0,2% к доллару и 2,2% к евро.
    Доллар к рублю <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 17.50 МСК котировался
по 89,65, и здесь рубль в плюсе, набирая 0,1% процента.
    Евро к рублю <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 96,53, что
является двухнедельным минимумом для рубля, который здесь
дешевеет на 1,3%.
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 12,22, и здесь рубль теряет 0,3%.
    В динамике рублевых кросс-курсов доллара и евро в
значительной мере отражаются изменения рынка форекс, где валюта
США продолжает падать на фоне обострения тарифной войны США с
ключевыми торговыми партнерами. Индекс доллара сейчас снижается
на 1,1% (104,42) <=USD> и котируется вблизи четырехмесячных
минимумов, в паре с евро доллар теряет 1,3% (%1,0766) <EUR=>, а
единая валюта обновляет против американской максимумы с 8
ноября.
    На внутреннем рынке перебивать позитивную геополитическую
повестку может текущий баланс локальных денежных потоков:
спекулятивная поддержка рублю ослабела после и так уже сильного
укрепления российской валюты в текущем году за счет
внешнеполитической составляющей. Одновременно сейчас отмечаются
сезонно пониженные объемы продаж экспортной выручки после уплаты
ежемесячных корпоративных налогов.
    Против может играть также восстанавливающийся после зимней
""спячки"" спрос импортеров на подешевевшую с начала года
инвалюту.
    Внешним риском для рубля остается значительно подешевевшая в
последние дни нефть, что вкупе с последними западными
рестрикциями в отношении российской нефтяной отрасли и теневого
танкерного флота таит угрозу сокращения валютной выручки за
экспорт нефти из РФ. Сейчас североморская смесь Brent <LCOc1>
дешевеет на 2,3% и котируется по $69,16 за баррель, что является
свежим минимумом с 11 сентября.
    Тем не менее, ситуация может быстро развернуться в пользу
рубля при поступлении сигналов о реальных намерениях украинской
и российской сторон договариваться о мире, а также в случае
шагов США по ослаблению санкционного давления на Москву.
    Дональд Трамп, выступая сегодня перед американскими
законодателями, сообщил, что Украина ""готова сесть за стол
переговоров как можно скорее, чтобы приблизить прочный мир"", а
также готова подписать с США сделку по редкоземельным элементам.
Глава Белого дома также сказал, что получил ""убедительные
сигналы"" из Москвы о готовности заключить мирное соглашение.
    ""Новостной фон в краткосрочной перспективе, вероятно,
продолжит оставаться позитивным, и это может не позволить
котировкам курса уйти заметно выше, несмотря на сезонное
охлаждение активности продаж валюты со стороны экспортеров в
начале месяца"", - считает Денис Попов из Промсвязьбанка.

2025/3/6 4:55,China's yuan eases from 4-month high as tariff relief fades,"SHANGHAI, March 6 (Reuters) - The yuan dipped from a
four-month high against the dollar on Thursday, underperforming
a broader lift in global peers as persistent worries about even
more U.S. tariffs against China overshadowed the reprieve
granted to Canada and Mexico.
    News that the U.S. would give automakers from its North
American neighbours some tariff relief and the euro's unexpected
strength pushed the greenback sharply lower against most
currencies overnight.
    While the onshore yuan <CNY=CFXS> firmed to a high of 7.2199
against the dollar on Wednesday, it pulled back on Thursday.
    Market participants said the overall sentiment for the yuan
remains subdued, despite the overnight gains.
    Ken Cheung, FX strategy director at Mizuho, expects the
impact from the dollar's decline on the yuan to be limited.
    ""The dramatically stable CNY following the rounds of 10%
U.S. tariff hikes might catch market participants off guard,""
said Cheung. 
    ""Trump's tariff uncertainties are unlikely to dissipate
before the start of China-U.S. trade talks, leaving the CNH and
CNY spot above the 7.2 handle,"" Cheung said.
    The spot yuan <CNY=CFXS> opened at 7.2350 per dollar and was
last trading 100 pips lower than the previous late session close
at 7.2445 as of 0330 GMT and 1.05% weaker than the central
bank's guidance.
    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China set
the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed
to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1692 per dollar, 694 pips firmer
than a Reuters' estimate.
    Beijing began its week-long annual parliamentary meeting of
the National People's Congress (NPC) on Wednesday by signalling
greater efforts to boost consumption to help protect economic
growth.
    Investors now await a press conference from policymakers

      关注晚间欧央行政策决议及周五美国非农数据
    

  

       路透上海3月6日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周四早盘高开230点后回吐近半涨幅，成交区间继续上移；中间价续升22点触一个月高点，和较路透预测偏离收窄至约700点。交易员表示，欧元强势反弹加剧美元调整，人民币的外部压力暂时缓解，不过关税重压下市场情绪仍相对谨慎。
    
    市场人士指出，市场关注欧元复苏，而美元在特朗普关税反复中遭到抛售，人民币被动跟随反弹；接下来重点关注晚间欧洲央行政策决议以及周五美国非农数据和市场主流预期是否相符。
    
    “美元/人民币的波动中枢会下移一些，但本身人民币缺乏升值的逻辑，负carry情况下也没法长期拿，”一外资行交易员称，“先看看明天非农，如果数据还是弱，估计美元还能再下一些。”
    
    
    另一外资行交易员也表示，目前人民币反弹更多是跟随性质，市场情绪似乎仍显谨慎。
    
    北欧斯安银行(SEB)亚洲战略主管Eugenia Victorino则认为，当前美国对华商品的平均关税已超30%，人民币仍需进一步贬值以缓解关税的冲击。预计“人民币需要贬至7.65才能抵消2月份征收的首批10%关税的影响。”不过近期美元疲软也帮助人民币小幅反弹。

    美联储在其褐皮书中表示，自1月中旬以来，美国经济活动略有增加，但并不均衡，就业小幅增长，物价温和上涨。在特朗普的政策将如何影响未来经济增长、劳动力需求和物价的不确定性上升之际，企业和家庭继续表示乐观。
    
    Monex USA 交易主管Juan Perez称，“如果事情朝着限制性保护主义的方向发展，金融体系就会开始做出调整，现在看来抛售美元头寸是明智之举。如果关税和贸易战被认为对美国经济不利，我们就会回到对宽松货币政策可能性的猜测。”
    
    
    根据芝商所的FedWatch工具，对美联储在5月初的会议上减息的预期在周二短暂攀升至50%以上，尾盘为40%，高于一周前的约28%；另外市场还预计美联储今年降息69个基点，高于此前降息不到50个基点的押注。
    
    全球汇市方面，欧元兑美元周四继续刷新四个月高点，此前德国提出建立5,000亿欧元基础设施基金并改革借贷规则，推动欧元区公债收益率飙升，而特朗普的关税政策反反复复，也加剧了美元的弱势。[FRX/CN]
        
    北京时间11:14，人民币兑美元<CNY=CFXS>即期报7.2462元，上日收报7.258元，夜盘终报7.2345元。今日人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>报7.1692元，创2月6日以来新高，上日为7.1714元。截至目前人民币即期成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为182.05亿美元。

    海外无本金交割远期外汇(NDF)<CNYNDFOR=>市场上，美元/人民币一年期品种<CNY1YNDFOR=>最新报在7.074元, 上日尾盘为7.064元。香港的离岸人民币兑美元即期<CNH=D3>最新报在7.2462元, 当前汇价与在岸即期价差倒挂0点，上一交易日尾盘报7.235元。（完）

2025/3/6 1:28,中国汇市：人民币兑美元中间价创一个月新高，美元降至四个月低点缓和贬压,"路透上海3月6日 - 人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周四报7.1692元，较上日的7.1714元小升22点，创2月6日以来新高，和路透预测偏离仍近700点。
    
    美元<.DXY>回落至四个月低点，从外部缓解了人民币的压力，只是国内供需均衡还需时日，监管层延续对单边预期的过滤，等待中间价恢复弹性的机会。
    
    人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>上日收盘报7.258元，夜盘终报7.2345元。离岸人民币即期<CNH=D3>最新报7.2434元，上日收盘在7.235元。稍早前路透测算今日人民币中间价大概会开在7.2386元附近，较上日贬值约672点，“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。
    

    北欧斯安银行(SEB)亚洲战略主管Eugenia Victorino认为，当前美国对华商品的平均关税已超30%，人民币仍需部分贬值才能抵消关税的冲击。预计“人民币需要贬至7.65才能抵消2月份征收的首批10%关税的影响。”不过近期美元疲软也帮助人民币小幅反弹。

    美联储在其褐皮书中表示，自1月中旬以来，美国经济活动略有增加，但并不均衡，就业小幅增长，物价温和上涨。在特朗普的政策将如何影响未来经济增长、劳动力需求和物价的不确定性上升之际，企业和家庭继续表示乐观。
    
    Monex USA 交易主管Juan Perez称，“如果事情朝着限制性保护主义的方向发展，金融体系就会开始做出调整，现在看来抛售美元头寸是明智之举。如果关税和贸易战被认为对美国经济不利，我们就会回到对宽松货币政策可能性的猜测。”
    
    
    根据芝商所的FedWatch工具，对美联储在5月初的会议上减息的预期在周二短暂攀升至50%以上，尾盘为40%，高于一周前的约28%；另外市场还预计美联储今年降息69个基点，高于此前降息不到50个基点的押注。
    
    全球汇市方面，美元指数<.DXY>周四亚洲早盘维持在104.30的两个月低点附近交投。市场对美国经济前景的担忧加剧了美元调整，目前市场焦点转向欧洲央行利率决议和美国的非农就业数据。[FRX/CN](完)

    Monex USA 交易主管Juan Perez称，“如果事情朝着限制性保护主义的方向发展，金融体系就会开始做出调整，现在看来抛售美元头寸是明智之举。如果关税和贸易战被认为对美国经济不利，我们就会回到对宽松货币政策可能性的猜测。”
    
    
    根据芝商所的FedWatch工具，对美联储在5月初的会议上减息的预期在周二短暂攀升至50%以上，尾盘为40%，高于一周前的约28%；另外市场还预计美联储今年降息69个基点，高于此前降息不到50个基点的押注。
    
    全球汇市方面，美元指数<.DXY>周四亚洲早盘维持在104.30的两个月低点附近交投。市场对美国经济前景的担忧加剧了美元调整，目前市场焦点转向欧洲央行利率决议和美国的非农就业数据。[FRX/CN](完)

2025/3/6 0:25,路透测算的人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>今日料开在7.2386元附近,"路透上海3月6日 - 路透根据中国外汇交易中心(CFETS)公布的人民币汇率形成机制测算，人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周四预计会开在7.2386元附近，较上日贬值约672点。
    
    由于欧洲的经济增长前景有所改善，叠加市场担心关税对美国通胀和经济的影响，隔夜美元<.DXY>大幅回落，人民币面临的外部压力继续缓解，不过当前国内外汇市场供需仍失衡，监管料延续对中间价的过滤举措。

    上日人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>收报7.258元，而中间价则为7.1714元。根据定价机制，今日中间价变动中，有866点下跌反映市场供求影响，另有194点上涨反映的是隔夜一篮子汇率基本保持不变所需要的点数；“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。

    路透测算的上日人民币兑美元中间价为7.2575元，和外汇交易中心公布的实际值偏差861点。上日路透根据CFETS公布的中间价测算，人民币汇率CFETS指数、参考SDR（特别提款权）篮子指数和参考BIS(国际清算银行)篮子指数分别为99.69、93.71和105.84。

    上日(截至北京时间次日凌晨3点)人民币兑美元即期累计成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为499.67亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

investors digest Wednesday's China's stimulus package, and any further
announcements.

2025/3/5 18:07,MERCADOS GLOBALES-Bolsas EEUU suben en sesión volátil en medio incertidumbre guerra arancelaria,"(Actualiza cotizaciones)
    Por Kevin Buckland y Amanda Cooper
       TOKIO/LONDRES, 5 mar (Reuters) - Las bolsas
estadounidenses subían en una jornada agitada el miércoles, en
la que la escalada de la guerra comercial entre Estados Unidos y
sus socios avivó la incertidumbre de los inversores, mientras
que el euro alcanzó su nivel más alto en cuatro meses frente al
dólar estadounidense.
    * Los precios del petróleo cayeron con fuerza, camino de su
tercer día de pérdidas, lastrados por las tensiones comerciales
después de que los inventarios de crudo estadounidenses
registraran una acumulación mayor de la esperada.
    * El jefe del Departamento de Comercio de Estados Unidos,
Howard Lutnick, dijo en una entrevista con Bloomberg que el
presidente Donald Trump está considerando proteger a sectores
como los fabricantes de automóviles del impacto de los aranceles
estadounidenses y que su gobierno hará un anuncio más tarde el
miércoles sobre los aranceles impuestos a Canadá y México.
    * Los aranceles estadounidenses a las importaciones de
Canadá, México y China entraron en vigencia el martes, cuando
Trump pronunció también su discurso sobre el Estado de la Unión,
en el que pregonó sus éxitos desde que asumió el cargo hace seis
semanas.
    * Canadá y China tomaron represalias de inmediato, mientras
que la presidenta mexicana, Claudia Sheinbaum, dijo que su país
podría buscar otros socios comerciales.
    * Las acciones están volátiles debido a la incertidumbre
sobre lo que sigue con los aranceles, dijo Rick Meckler, socio
de Cherry Lane Investments en New Vernon, Nueva Jersey.
   * Los inversores también digirieron una encuesta del ISM, que
mostró que la actividad del sector servicios estadounidense se
situó en territorio de expansión en 53,5, por encima de las
expectativas de 52,6.
    * El Promedio Industrial Dow Jones <.DJI> subía 330,13
puntos, o un 0,78%, a 42.851,12 unidades, el S&P 500 <.SPX>
ganaba 41,97 puntos, o un 0,73%, hasta 5.820,12 unidades; y el
Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> avanzaba 182,45 puntos, o un 1%, hasta
18.467,39 unidades.
    * El índice MSCI de valores de todo el mundo <.MIWD00000PUS>
subía 6,52 puntos, o un 0,77%, hasta 852,66 puntos. El índice
paneuropeo STOXX 600 <.STOXX> ganó un 0,91%. La perspectiva de
un aumento significativo del gasto europeo en seguridad ha
disparado este mes los valores de defensa de la región.
    * El euro <EUR=> escalaba un 1,32%, a 1,0764 dólares, camino
de su mejor subida semanal desde noviembre de 2022. El euro
recibió un impulso a última hora del martes, cuando los partidos
políticos alemanes acordaron un fondo de infraestructuras de
500.000 millones de euros (534.750 millones de dólares) y, sobre
todo, una revisión de los límites de endeudamiento.
   * Los rendimientos de los bonos del Tesoro de Estados Unidos
subían en su mayoría, ya que los inversores evaluaron los datos
económicos mientras sopesaban la incertidumbre en torno a los
aranceles de Trump.

2025/3/5 14:25,BUZZ-FX options wrap - EUR/USD leads a frenzied premium surge,"EUR/USD leads EUR/cross options in a frenzied surge for implied volatility with
a significant shift in directional premium to EUR calls over puts. 
    A lack of existing EUR/USD topside options and related hedging flows helped
to fuel the spot and option gains as shorts were covered. One-week implied
volatility up 3.0 within 24 hours to 11.25 and 1-month from 7.8 to 9.15 before
some healthy profit taking. 
    One-week 25 delta risk reversals flipped from 0.5 EUR puts on Tuesday to
1.25 EUR calls on Wednesday - their highest topside over downside strike premium
since 2020. One-month 25 delta erased all of the 0.65 vol premium for downside
strikes that it was holding on Tuesday.  
    Traded volumes were huge, with DTCC reporting 12-billion euros of EUR
calls/USD puts trading by midday London. 
    The EUR demand was broad-based and prompted implied volatility and EUR call
demand in all EUR related pairs, albeit to a lesser extent. 
    Implied volatility remained buoyant by recent highs in other pairings, but
lacked the gains and demand experienced among EUR peers.
    GBP/USD's break above 1.2800 fuelled demand for options that would benefit
from 1.3000 trading.

CloseRTRS: DOLLAR MAULED BY TRUMP TRADE WAR; GERMAN 'BAZOOKA' BLASTS BONDS
Mar 5 2025 7:11
TOKYO/LONDON, March 5 (Reuters) - The dollar hit three-month
lows on Wednesday as the U.S.' trade war
(https://go.refinitiv.com/?u=Y3B1cmw6Ly9hcHBzLmNwLi9hcHBzL25ld3MtbGlua3MtbmF2aWdhdGlvbi8/c3RvcnlJZD1uTDJOM1BOMDFL)
with its partners escalated, while a major overhaul
to German government borrowing triggered the biggest sell-off
in the country's debt since the late 1990s.

? ? In addition to the cocktail of tariffs and a seismic shift in German
fiscal policy, investors also parsed through the start of China's
annual sessions of its parliament, the National People's Congress
(NPC), at which Beijing retained a goal
(https://go.refinitiv.com/?u=Y3B1cmw6Ly9hcHBzLmNwLi9hcHBzL25ld3MtbGlua3MtbmF2aWdhdGlvbi8/c3RvcnlJZD1uTDJOM1BOMURR)
of roughly 5% economic growth for 2025.

? ? The euro EUR=EBS
(https://go.refinitiv.com/?u=Y3B1cmw6Ly9hcHBzLmNwLi9BcHBzL1F1b3RlV2ViQXBpP1JJQz1FVVI9RUJT)
hit its
highest in four months, while European stocks surged .STOXX
(https://go.refinitiv.com/?u=Y3B1cmw6Ly9hcHBzLmNwLi9BcHBzL1F1b3RlV2ViQXBpP1JJQz0uU1RPWFg=).
The biggest
casualties were longer-dated German government bonds, caught
up in their worst one-day selloff in more than 25 years as yields
ripped higher.

? ? Overnight, German political parties agreed
(https://go.refinitiv.com/?u=Y3B1cmw6Ly9hcHBzLmNwLi9hcHBzL25ld3MtbGlua3MtbmF2aWdhdGlvbi8/c3RvcnlJZD1uTDVOM1BOMFhY)
to a 500 billion-euro ($534.75 billion) infrastructure fund
and, crucially, an overhaul in borrowing limits that economists
billed as ""a really big bazooka

? ? ""Last night Germany announced plans for one of the largest fiscal
regime shifts in post-war history, perhaps with reunification
35 years ago being the only rival,"" Deutsche Bank strategist
Jim Reid said.

? ? ""Everything you thought you knew about Germany's economic prospects
three months ago, or even three weeks ago, should be ripped up
and you should start your analysis from fresh,"" he said.

? ? German 30-year yields - the rate the government pays to borrow
over the very long term - rose by almost a quarter of a percentage
point in early trading, which would have marked their largest
rise since October 1998.

? ? The 30-year bond was last up 15 basis points to yield 2.978%.

up
3.5 bps at 4.55%.

? ? Europe's STOXX 600 jumped by more than 1% to record highs. The
prospect of a meaningful increase in European spending on security
has sent the region's defence stocks soaring this month.


? ? TRADE WAR INCOMING
? ? U.S. tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China went into
effect on Tuesday, when President Donald Trump also delivered
his State of the Union address
(https://go.refinitiv.com/?u=Y3B1cmw6Ly9hcHBzLmNwLi9hcHBzL25ld3MtbGlua3MtbmF2aWdhdGlvbi8/c3RvcnlJZD1uTDJOM1BOMEtM),
in which he touted his successes since
taking office six weeks ago.

? ? Canada and China retaliated immediately, while Mexican President
Claudia Sheinbaum vowed to respond likewise, without giving
details.

? ? With a full-on trade war underway, crude oil hit six-month lows,
while bitcoin BTC=

? ? ""Fears about weaker U.S. and global economic activity are manifesting
in the markets, with cyclicals driving the sell-off,"" said Kyle

? ? In China, the offshore yuan CNH=EBS

day since Trump's inauguration as investors ditched the dollar.

more fiscal resources than last year to mitigate the impact of
rising U.S. tariffs.

? ? China aims for a budget deficit of about 4% of gross domestic product
in 2025, up from 3% in 2024.

? ? ""It doesn't look like China wants to go overboard with spending
right away, given the tariff threats, as they potentially want
to save ammunition for external threats later in the year,"" Saxo
chief investment strategist Charu Chanana said.

The U.S. dollar hovered near a three-month low against major currencies on Wednesday, weighed down by the latest round of U.S. tariffs and retaliatory measures from Canada and China, which have further escalated the ongoing trade conflict. The euro surged to a nearly four-month high after German political parties reached a consensus on launching a 500-billion-euro infrastructure fund. The British pound also remained strong, trading near a three-month peak. In Asia, Hong Kong stocks saw gains, and the offshore yuan in China slipped 0.1% to 7.2640 per dollar, following a 0.7% rally on Tuesday. To counter the impact of escalating U.S. tariffs, Beijing upheld its 5% economic growth target and allocated more fiscal resources than last year. China is projecting a budget deficit of approximately 4% of its GDP in 2025, an increase from 3% in 2024. Growth, inflation, and fiscal spending targets were largely in line with expectations. Crude oil prices slid to six-month lows, while bitcoin steadied at approximately $87,500 following a volatile week. Market sentiment reflected growing concerns over a potential slowdown in U.S. and global economic activity, with cyclical stocks leading the decline. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.4% after wavering between modest gains and losses, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.1%.

The escalating trade conflict spearheaded by Donald Trump―dismissed as ""dumb"" by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau―continues to capture the attention of investors, dampening sentiment across multiple asset classes. This week, despite the overarching uncertainty, the situation presents a nuanced picture. Wall Street seems poised for a rebound, with futures pointing to a higher opening following Tuesday’s decline, and European markets are projected to post even stronger gains. Adding a layer of optimism, the coalition parties negotiating Germany’s next government have reached pivotal agreements, including the creation of a substantial 500 billion euro ($530 billion) infrastructure fund and the relaxation of fiscal rules to boost defense spending and economic growth. Furthermore, the European Commission has proposed borrowing up to 150 billion euros to lend to EU member states as part of a rearmament initiative. These developments unfold against the backdrop of volatile peace negotiations in Ukraine, where Washington appears to be recalibrating its stance―distancing itself from European allies while fostering closer ties with Moscow. Encouragingly, a thaw in relations seems increasingly plausible. U.S. President Donald Trump expressed satisfaction with a conciliatory letter from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, following their contentious Oval Office meeting last week. Trump shared excerpts of the letter during his first congressional address since returning to office, where he also highlighted the breadth of his executive actions just six weeks into his term. However, investors have raised concerns over Trump’s proposal to repeal a bipartisan law that allocates $52.7 billion in subsidies for semiconductor manufacturing, although market reactions to this development have been muted. Meanwhile, investors have interpreted the ongoing tariff measures between nations as relatively restrained for now.

Over the past month, there has been a noticeable divergence in yield composition specifically across the US, UK, and Germany. Key factors include: US real yields have fallen due to shifting Fed expectations, from pausing over tariff-related inflation in January to responding to potential activity slowdowns in February. The Bank of England's cautious stance on rate cuts has supported UK real yields. Gilt and Bund nominal yields trail US Treasuries, partly due to increased defense funding in Germany. UK nominal yields underperform US yields amid fiscal credibility concerns following January's rise. While these factors may shift with new data, market participants believe the pricing reflects a structural trend, while the UK market pricing hinges on the OBR Spring Forecast on 26 March, given the government's preference for a single annual fiscal event. ?

The U.S. dollar hovered near a three-month low against major currencies on Wednesday, weighed down by the latest round of U.S. tariffs and retaliatory measures from Canada and China, which have further escalated the ongoing trade conflict. The euro surged to a nearly four-month high after German political parties reached a consensus on launching a 500-billion-euro infrastructure fund. The British pound also remained strong, trading near a three-month peak. In Asia, Hong Kong stocks saw gains, and the offshore yuan in China slipped 0.1% to 7.2640 per dollar, following a 0.7% rally on Tuesday. To counter the impact of escalating U.S. tariffs, Beijing upheld its 5% economic growth target and allocated more fiscal resources than last year. China is projecting a budget deficit of approximately 4% of its GDP in 2025, an increase from 3% in 2024. Growth, inflation, and fiscal spending targets were largely in line with expectations. Crude oil prices slid to six-month lows, while bitcoin steadied at approximately $87,500 following a volatile week. Market sentiment reflected growing concerns over a potential slowdown in U.S. and global economic activity, with cyclical stocks leading the decline. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.4% after wavering between modest gains and losses, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.1%.

The escalating trade conflict spearheaded by Donald Trump―dismissed as ""dumb"" by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau―continues to capture the attention of investors, dampening sentiment across multiple asset classes. This week, despite the overarching uncertainty, the situation presents a nuanced picture. Wall Street seems poised for a rebound, with futures pointing to a higher opening following Tuesday’s decline, and European markets are projected to post even stronger gains. Adding a layer of optimism, the coalition parties negotiating Germany’s next government have reached pivotal agreements, including the creation of a substantial 500 billion euro ($530 billion) infrastructure fund and the relaxation of fiscal rules to boost defense spending and economic growth. Furthermore, the European Commission has proposed borrowing up to 150 billion euros to lend to EU member states as part of a rearmament initiative. These developments unfold against the backdrop of volatile peace negotiations in Ukraine, where Washington appears to be recalibrating its stance―distancing itself from European allies while fostering closer ties with Moscow. Encouragingly, a thaw in relations seems increasingly plausible. U.S. President Donald Trump expressed satisfaction with a conciliatory letter from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, following their contentious Oval Office meeting last week. Trump shared excerpts of the letter during his first congressional address since returning to office, where he also highlighted the breadth of his executive actions just six weeks into his term. However, investors have raised concerns over Trump’s proposal to repeal a bipartisan law that allocates $52.7 billion in subsidies for semiconductor manufacturing, although market reactions to this development have been muted. Meanwhile, investors have interpreted the ongoing tariff measures between nations as relatively restrained for now.

Over the past month, there has been a noticeable divergence in yield composition specifically across the US, UK, and Germany. Key factors include: US real yields have fallen due to shifting Fed expectations, from pausing over tariff-related inflation in January to responding to potential activity slowdowns in February. The Bank of England's cautious stance on rate cuts has supported UK real yields. Gilt and Bund nominal yields trail US Treasuries, partly due to increased defense funding in Germany. UK nominal yields underperform US yields amid fiscal credibility concerns following January's rise. While these factors may shift with new data, market participants believe the pricing reflects a structural trend, while the UK market pricing hinges on the OBR Spring Forecast on 26 March, given the government's preference for a single annual fiscal event. ?

2025/3/5 11:10,BUZZ-COMMENT-Big EUR/USD option profits - no matter FX direction,"March 5 (Reuters) - Those using FX options to cover a break-out from
EUR/USD's recent 1.04-1.05 range have made a significant profit which would have
been similar no matter which direction the break-out occurred - here's how. 
    FX options thrive on volatility and rapid directional moves, which are
unknown in advance but key to the options premium. Dealers use implied
volatility as a stand-in.  Any disparity between implied and actual/realised
volatility becomes tradable, as does any movement in implied volatility.  
    EUR/USD implied volatility fell to longer term lows in mid February, before
meeting mild demand and remaining supported thereafter. This suggested that
implied volatility was less likely to lose more ground and more likely to edge
higher once EUR/USD started to move again. 
    A plain 3-month expiry vanilla straddle option had an implied volatility
around 7.15 at that time - a premium of 2.85% of EUR or 304 USD pips. Buyers
would have owned the right to either buy or sell EUR/USD at a set strike and
expiry date. However, as a volatility play, the option holders would avoid any
currency exposure by adjusting a related cash hedge on a daily basis to keep the
option delta neutral. 
    EUR/USD implied volatility has surged higher with spot in the last 24 hours
and consequently increased the premium for all EUR/USD FX options. That 3-month
expiry implied volatility is now 8.0 and its premium has increased to 3.26% of
EUR or 349 USD pips. 
    For a typical FX option trade of 30 million euros, the difference between
7.15 and 8.0 implied volatility on a 3-month straddle expiry equates to a profit
of around 125,000 euros.
    Selling vanilla options works in reverse and maybe the next strategy that
traders employ if they think that the EUR/USD spot rally has run its course for
now.

2025/3/5 10:27,Рубль достиг на Мосбирже 2-недельного минимума в паре с юанем,"МОСКВА, 5 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль в среду вновь дешевеет на
Мосбирже с учетом текущего баланса локальных потоков не в пользу
российской валюты, тогда как на форексе он выглядит получше на
фоне усилившихся после выступления президента США Дональда
Трампа ожиданий скорого завершения российской-украинского
конфликта.
    Новости о незначительном, до 5,96 миллиарда рублей в день с
5,56 миллиарда, росте мартовских нетто-продаж китайской валюты
Центробанком в рамках зеркалирования трат из ФНБ и проведения
операций по бюджетному правилу не оказали влияния на динамику
рубля, но формально это играет на стороне российской валюты.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 13.15 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 12,27, и российская валюта
теряет 0,9%, ранее достигнув двухнедельного минимума 12,35.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к 13.15 МСК
котировались вблизи отметок 12,30, 90,40 и 96,30 соответственно,
и рубль теряет 1% к юаню, 0,5% к доллару и 2,1% к евро.
    Доллар к рублю <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 13.15 МСК котировался
по 89,70, и рубль в символическом плюсе, набирая менее 0,1%
процента.
    Евро к рублю <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 95,75, и
рубль здесь дешевеет на 0,4%.
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 12,20, и здесь рубль теряет 0,1%.
    В динамике рублевых кросс-курсов доллара и евро в
значительной мере отражаются изменения рынка форекс, где валюта
США продолжает падать на фоне обострения тарифной войны США с
ключевыми торговыми партнерами. Индекс доллара сейчас снижается
на 0,6% (104,94) <=USD> и котируется вблизи четырехмесячных
минимумов, в паре с евро доллар теряет 0,8% (%1,0707) <EUR=>, а
единая валюта обновляет против американской максимумы с 11
ноября.
    На внутреннем рынке перебивать позитивную геополитическую
повестку может текущий баланс локальных денежных потоков:
спекулятивная поддержка рублю ослабела после и так уже сильного
укрепления российской валюты в текущем году за счет
внешнеполитической составляющей. Одновременно сейчас отмечаются
сезонно пониженные объемы продаж экспортной выручки после уплаты
ежемесячных корпоративных налогов.
    Против может играть также восстанавливающийся после зимней
""спячки"" спрос импортеров на подешевевшую с начала года
инвалюту.
    Внешним риском для рубля остается значительно подешевевшая в
последние дни нефть, что вкупе с последними западными
рестрикциями в отношении российской нефтяной отрасли и теневого
танкерного флота таит угрозу сокращения валютной выручки за
экспорт нефти из РФ. Сейчас североморская смесь Brent <LCOc1>
дешевеет на 0,7% и котируется по 70,50 за баррель, что недалеко
от достигнутого накануне минимума с 11 сентября.
    Тем не менее, ситуация может быстро развернуться в пользу
рубля при поступлении сигналов о реальных намерениях украинской
и российской сторон договариваться о мире, а также в случае
шагов США по ослаблению санкционного давления на Москву.
    Дональд Трамп, выступая сегодня перед американскими
законодателями, сообщил, что Украина ""готова сесть за стол
переговоров как можно скорее, чтобы приблизить прочный мир"", а
также готова подписать с США сделку по редкоземельным элементам.
Глава Белого дома также сказал, что получил ""убедительные
сигналы"" из Москвы о готовности заключить мирное соглашение с
Киевом.
    ""Новостной фон в краткосрочной перспективе, вероятно,
продолжит оставаться позитивным, и это может не позволить
котировкам курса уйти заметно выше, несмотря на сезонное
охлаждение активности продаж валюты со стороны экспортеров в
начале месяца"", - считает Денис Попов из Промсвязьбанка.

2025/3/5 9:34,BUZZ-COMMENT-EUR/USD options reach extremes in topside buying frenzy,"March 5 (Reuters) - There's been a mad scramble to buy EUR/USD
volatility and topside protection via FX options in early London Wednesday, with
some prices reaching their highest levels since 2020. 
    DTCC traded option data highlighted a market short of topside strike
protection by comparison to downside strikes, a situation that has exacerbated
spot gains and demand for options.  
    FX option implied volatility is significantly higher across the entire
1-12-month expiry term structure in the last 24 hours, with very short dated
expiries leading the charge. One-week implied volatility has reached 11.0 from
8.0 early Tuesday  - a new high since early February. The benchmark 1-month
expiry EUR/USD implied volatility is above 9.0 from 7.8 on Tuesday - a new post
U.S. presidential inauguration high. 
    The most significant shift in EUR/USD option pricing - and a clear indicator
of changing directional risk - is unfolding in risk reversal contracts. These
contracts have seen a dramatic erosion of their long-standing EUR put-over-call
implied volatility premium, narrowing the gap between downside and upside
strikes.
    The implied volatility premium on a 1-week 25 delta risk reversal has gone
from 0.5 EUR puts on Tuesday to 1.05 EUR calls on Wednesday - its highest
topside strike premium since 2020. The benchmark 1-month expiry 25 delta risk
reversal has totally erased its EUR put premium, having traded 0.65 EUR puts on
Tuesday. The last time it traded at these levels was when it reached 0.25 EUR
calls over puts in September 2024 and it hasn't traded much above there since
2020.

2025/3/5 8:58,Юань стабилен на фоне раскрытия экономических целей Пекина на 2025г,"ШАНХАЙ, 5 мар (Рейтер) - Китайский юань удерживает
позиции в паре с долларом в среду, несмотря на то что
напряженность в торговых отношениях с Соединенными Штатами
сохраняется, на фоне объявления экономических ориентиров Пекином
и обещания постепенного смягчения денежно-кредитной политики в
2025 году.
    На открывшемся в среду ежегодном заседании Всекитайского
собрания народных представителей руководство КНР оставило без
изменений цель экономического роста на уровне примерно 5% -
таком же, как в прошлом году, - одновременно расширив бюджетную
поддержку и понизив целевой уровень инфляции.
    Правительство КНР намерено поддерживать стабильный курс юаня
и медленно смягчать денежно-кредитную политику, говорится в 
документе, подготовленном к сессии ВСНП.
    Трейдеры и аналитики отметили, что целевой показатель роста
ВВП примерно на 5% на фоне напряженности в отношениях между
Китаем и США и слабых настроений означает, что настройки  ДКП, в
частности норма обязательных банковских резервов (RRR), будут
смягчены. Это может оказать дополнительное давление на юань,
учитывая его относительно низкую доходность.
    ""Сохранение целевого показателя роста около 5% несмотря на
более сложные внешние условия является демонстрацией
уверенности, а также подразумевает более сильную государственную
поддержку внутреннего спроса в этом году"", - сказал Линн Сон из
ING.
    ""Мы считаем, что существует достаточно высокая вероятность
развертывания новых мер в ближайшие месяц-два. Скорее всего, это
начнется с денежно-кредитной политики, поскольку ее реализация
проще и быстрее - мы ожидаем снижения процентной ставки и RRR в
марте или апреле"".
    Спотовый юань в Китайской системе валютной торговли SFETS на
материковом рынке <CNY=CFXS> к 09:50 МСК был стабилен на
уровне? 7,2626?, а на офшорном рынке <CNH=> подешевел на 0,17%
до 7,2633 юаня за доллар. 
    Перед открытием сессии ЦБ Китая объявил срединный
фиксированный курс <CNY=PBOC> на уровне 7,1714 за доллар. При
этом значение оказалось на 861 pips (десятитысячных долей
процентного пункта) сильнее приведенного Рейтер прогноза
аналитиков.
    ""Я по-прежнему полагаю, что курс доллара к юаню будет
держаться ниже 7,35"", - сказала Бекки Лю из Standard Chartered.
    ""Изменение оборонительного уровня сейчас нецелесообразно,
поскольку стабильность юаня остается одной из редких точек
соприкосновения между (президентом США) Трампом и (председателем
КНР) Си. В знак готовности к продуктивному старту переговоров
Китай сохраняет ужесточенные условия на межбанковском рынке
ликвидности для поддержания курса юаня"".

       路透上海/北京3月5日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周三收升逾200点创一周新
高；中间价亦小涨至近两周高点，仍较路透预测高出逾850点。交易员表示，美国加征关税
后美元出现较大调整，减轻人民币的外部压力；不过关税担忧仍在，一旦外部压力回升，人
民币仍可能向7.3元关口靠近。
    
    市场人士指出，中国政府工作报告设定的今年各项经济目标基本符合预期，后续更关注
特朗普的关税政策以及美国经济表现对美元的影响。美元/人民币长端掉期套利需求和大行
维稳操作形成良好对冲，长端掉期大概率延续当前的区间整理走势。
    
    “美元调整，人民币有些升值的，”一外资行交易员称，“不过关税问题还在，逢低购
汇的需求不会少的，除非内外部条件再次配合，像去年9月那样把囤汇盘逼出来。”
    
    
        瑞穗银行亚洲首席策略师张建泰点评指出，中国政府工作报告重申“保持人民币汇
率在合理均衡水平上的基本稳定”，这表明在中美贸易战不断升级情况下，中国外汇政策原
则上不会改变。   
    
    招商银行金融市场部观点也认为，中国全国人大和政协“两会”正当时，人民币中间价
持稳，预计人民币即期汇率的波幅会相对可控，依然维持区间震荡观点。
    
    渣打银行全球研究部中国宏观策略主管刘洁则提到，稳定的人民币汇率或是中美高层为
数不多的共识，预计人民币仍不会跌破7.35元关口，另外人民币的实际有效汇率仍非常便宜
，继续贬值的好处非常有限。
    
    随着美国提高对中加墨三国的关税水平，中加迅速展开反制，市场愈发认为特朗普并非
空谈，因此开始考虑美国和全球经济增长放缓的因素。

    毕马威(KPMG)首席经济学家Diane Swonk称，关税的影响表面上看是一种价格冲击，但
也可能开始扼杀需求，特别是如果消费者退缩，面临高度不确定性的企业抑制投资和招聘。
    
    星展银行也表示，加征关税引发对美国滞胀的担忧，并施压美元，但市场将关注美国后
续经济数据和政策反应，以衡量美国经济是否能够吸收这些冲击。

2025/3/5 8:31,Рубль вновь слабеет на Мосбирже - сезонность и нефть перебивают геополитику,"МОСКВА, 5 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль в среду вновь дешевеет на
Мосбирже с учетом текущего баланса локальных потоков не в пользу
российской валюты, тогда как на форексе он выглядит получше на
фоне усилившихся после выступления президента США Дональда
Трампа ожиданий у иностранных игроков скорого завершения
российской-украинского конфликта.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 11.00 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 12,29, и российская валюта
теряет 1%, ранее достигнув двухнедельного минимума 12,33.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к 11.00 МСК
котировались вблизи отметок 12,30, 90,60 и 96,00 соответственно,
и рубль теряет 1% к юаню, 0,8% к доллару и 1,8% к евро.
    Доллар к рублю <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 11.00 МСК котировался
по 89,50, и рубль набирает 0,3% процента.
    Евро к рублю <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 95,48, и
рубль здесь дешевеет на 0,1%.
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 12,20, и здесь рубль теряет менее 0,1%.
    На внешнем контуре поддержкой рублю может выступать вновь
наполненная позитивом геополитическая повестка, за предыдущие
несколько дней неоднократно менявшая знак.
    Дональд Трамп, выступая сегодня перед американскими
законодателями, сообщил, что Украина ""готова сесть за стол
переговоров как можно скорее, чтобы приблизить прочный мир"", а
также готова подписать с США сделку по редкоземельным элементам.
Глава Белого дома также сказал, что получил ""убедительные
сигналы"" из Москвы о готовности заключить мирное соглашение с
Киевом.
    ""Новостной фон в краткосрочной перспективе, вероятно,
продолжит оставаться позитивным, и это может не позволить
котировкам курса уйти заметно выше, несмотря на сезонное
охлаждение активности продаж валюты со стороны экспортеров в
начале месяца"", - считает Денис Попов из Промсвязьбанка. 
    На внутреннем рынке перебивать позитивную геополитическую
повестку может текущий баланс локальных денежных потоков:
спекулятивная поддержка рублю ослабела после и так уже сильного
укрепления российской валюты в текущем году за счет
внешнеполитической составляющей, одновременно сейчас сезонно
пониженные объемы продаж экспортной выручки после уплаты
ежемесячных корпоративных налогов.
    Против может играть также восстанавливающийся после зимней
""спячки"" спрос импортеров на подешевевшую с начала года
инвалюту.
    Внешним риском для рубля остается значительно подешевевшая в
последние дни нефть <LCOc1>, что вкупе с последними западными
рестрикциями в отношении российской нефтяной отрасли и теневого
танкерного флота таит угрозу сокращения валютной выручки за
экспорт нефти из РФ. 
    Ситуация может быстро развернуться в пользу рубля при
поступлении сигналов о реальных намерениях украинской и
российской сторон договариваться о мире, а также в случае шагов
США по ослаблению санкционного давления на Москву.
     В фокусе внимания - публикация в полдень Минфином
параметров свежих операций по бюджетному правилу, от которых
зависят нетто-продажи китайской валюты Центробанком на биржевом
рынке, в рамках зеркалирования трат из ФНБ и исполнения
бюджетного правила. Сейчас регулятор продает юани на 5,6
миллиарда рублей в день.

2025/3/5 8:12,Asia-Pacific markets advance as U.S. signals potential tariff negotiations,"Asia-Pacific markets advance as U.S. signals potential tariff negotiationsAsia-Pacific markets mostly advance after US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested that the US might reach a compromise with Canada and Mexico on tariffs. The move alleviated concerns over the global trade war, which had escalated due to US tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China.

Investors reacted positively to a copy of China's work report, which set a 2025 GDP growth target of around 5% and outlined stimulus measures for the economy, amid a rising trade spat with the U.S.

Japan (NKY:IND) rose 0.16% struggled to find clear direction on Wednesday. The Japanese yen declined toward 150 per dollar on Wednesday, retreating from five-month highs following hawkish comments from a senior Bank of Japan official.

The Au Jibun Bank Japan Services PMI was revised higher to 53.7 in February 2025, up from a preliminary reading of 53.1 and January's 53.0. The au Jibun Bank Japan Composite PMI stood at 52.0 in February, above flash data of 51.6 and up from January's figure of 51.1.

Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida indicated that the central bank would raise interest rates further if its forecasts are met, stressing that the exit from its extensive monetary easing program is just beginning.

China (SHCOMP) rose 0.55% to below 3,320, while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.3% to 10,650 on Wednesday, and the offshore yuan slid past 7.27 per dollar, erasing gains from the previous session.

The Caixin China General Services PMI unexpectedly advanced to 51.4 in February 2025, up from January's four-month low of 51.0, surpassing market forecasts of 50.8 amid an improvement in market demand. The Caixin China General Composite PMI increased to 51.5 in February 2025 from 51.1 in the previous month

In addition, China set a GDP growth target of around 5% for 2025 during this week's parliamentary meeting, while raising its budget deficit target to 4% of GDP from 3% in 2024.

Hong Kong (HSI) rose 2.86% to 23,205 in early trading on Wednesday, rebounding from a modest fall in the prior session.

The S&P Global Hong Kong SAR PMI fell to 49.0 in February 2025 from 51.0 in January, marking the first contraction since August 2024.

India (SENSEX) rose 1.20% to 73,823 in morning trade on Wednesday, halting losses from the previous three sessions, mainly supported by the tech sector, auto, PSU banks, and metals.

The HSBC India Services PMI was revised lower to 59.0 in February 2025 from 61.6 in the flash reading.

Australia (AS51) fell 0.70% to close at 8,141 on Wednesday, marking its lowest level in over two months. The Australian dollar slipped below $0.625 on Wednesday, reversing a two-day rally despite stronger-than-expected economic growth data.

Australia's economy grew by 0.6% in the fourth quarter, up from 0.3% in the previous quarter and surpassing market expectations of 0.5%. On an annual basis, the GDP expanded 1.3%, after a 0.8% rise in Q3 and above consensus of 1.2%.

The S&P Global Australia Services PMI Business Activity Index fell to 50.8 in February, down from 51.2 in January.

The Ai Group Industry Index for the Australian manufacturing sector improved by 13.2 points but still indicated contraction at -8.2, indicating a gradual improvement since mid-2024.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's governor, Adrian Orr, abruptly stepped down on Wednesday with three years remaining in his term, providing no reason for his resignation. His departure leaves the bank without a permanent leader amid the country's worst economic downturn in three decades.

In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended in red amid escalating trade tensions.

U.S. stock futures climbed on Wednesday after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that a potential compromise on tariffs between the US, Canada, and Mexico could be in the works: Dow +0.51%; S&P 500 +0.63%; Nasdaq +0.76%.

Investors are now turning their attention to Trump's upcoming address to Congress, hoping for clues on the direction of US trade policy. Investors are also focused on Friday's monthly jobs report for fresh insights into the labor market.

2025/3/5 6:35,Рубль растет к доллару на форексе после выступления Трампа,"МОСКВА, 5 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль утром среды дорожает на
форексе против ключевой валюты-убежища, американского доллара,
после усилившего ожидания скорого завершения
российской-украинского конфликта выступления президента США
Дональда Трампа.
    Текущая новостная повестка будет отыгрываться и после
открытия валютных торгов Мосбиржи, а в фокусе внимания окажутся
еще и параметры мартовских валютных интервенций Центробанка,
которые станут известны сегодня в полдень.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 9.15 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 89,10, рубль набирает 0,7% от уровней закрытия вторника, по
итогам которого он потерял менее 0,1%, показывая в течение дня в
основном позитивную динамику.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется по 95,30, и рубль
набирает 0,1% от закрытия вторника, по итогам которого
российская валюта потеряла 1,4%, значительную часть торгов
котируясь в плюсе.
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> сейчас находится на форексе у
отметки 12,19, вблизи от последних вчерашних показателей LSEG.
    Вчерашние же торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами
""завтра"" завершились на уровне 12,16 рубля за юань - российская
валюта в итоге потеряла 0,5% при объеме сделок в 94 миллиарда
рублей.
    Рубль во вторник подешевел на Мосбирже с учетом
потенциальных рисков для российской валюты от падения нефти на
пятимесячные минимумы, а также из-за негативного фактора
сезонного снижения продаж экспортной выручки в начале
календарного месяца после уплаты ежемесячных корпоративных
налогов.  На форексе в рублевых котировках СКВ также находило
свое отражение ослабление валюты США до трехмесячного минимума
из-за опасений замедления роста американской экономики после
начала торговой войны США с Канадой, Мексикой и Китаем, а также
параллельный рост пары евро/доллар.
    Сегодня же ключевой поддержкой рублю может стать вновь
наполненная позитивном геополитическая повестка, за предыдущие
несколько дней неоднократно менявшая знак.
    Дональд Трамп, выступая сегодня перед американскими
законодателями, сообщил, что Украина ""готова сесть за стол
переговоров как можно скорее, чтобы приблизить прочный мир"", а
также готова подписать с США сделку по редкоземельным элементам.
Глава Белого дома также сказал, что получил ""убедительные
сигналы"" из Москвы о готовности заключить мирное соглашение с
Киевом.
    В случае завершения конфликта на Украине могут увеличиться
шансы ослабления западного санкционного режима в отношении
России, что в том числе, может привести к продолжению укрепления
рубля, который уже за счет ожиданий деэскалации при новой
республиканской администрации входит в число лидеров форекса по
темпам роста с начала текущего года.
    Нефтяной рынок также реагирует на возможность ослабления
антироссийских санкций, но пока в ином ключе - нефть дешевеет
из-за опасений роста поставок из России при пониженном
санкционном режиме.
    Накануне баррель Brent <LCOc1> падал на минимум с 11
сентября прошлого года, отметку $69,75 за баррель, хотя вечером
отбил значительную часть внутридневных потерь. Сегодня утром
североморская смесь дешевеет на 0,3% и оценивается в $70,84 за
баррель. Против также сыграло решение стран ОПЕК+ приступить к
росту добычи в рамках картеля с апреля, что будет первым
повышением поставок с 2022 года.
    На форексе индекс доллара утром вторника показывает
минимальные изменения после почти однопроцентного падения
накануне и котируется по 105,52 <=USD>. Евро сейчас немного
подрастает и котируется по $1,0631 <EUR=>.
    Юань немного дорожает на континентальном рынке КНР (7,2605)
<CNY=>, но теряет почти 0,2% на офшорном (7,2626) <CNH=>.

 (Adds details and comments, updates prices)
       SHANGHAI, March 5 (Reuters) - China's yuan held steady
against the dollar on Wednesday, as Beijing outlined a steady
economic growth target and measured monetary easing for this
year even as escalating trade tensions with the United States
raised uncertainty about the outlook. 
    China kept its economic growth target for this year
unchanged at roughly 5% while committing more fiscal resources
than last year and lowering its inflation target, as the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's rubber-stamp
parliament, began its annual meeting on Wednesday.
    A government document prepared for the NPC annual meeting
showed China aims to keep the yuan stable, and ease monetary
policy slowly.
        ""The lower CPI target is likely to function more as an
expectation-guiding tool, providing greater monetary policy
flexibility,"" said Tommy Xie, head of Asia macro research at
OCBC Bank. 
  
        ""With inflationary pressures subdued, this adjustment
could pave the way for further monetary easing, reinforcing
expectations of stronger policy support.""
  
    Traders and analysts said the growth target against a
backdrop of Sino-U.S. tensions and weak sentiment meant monetary
settings, particularly the reserve ratio (RRR), will be reduced.
That could pressure the yuan further, given its relatively low
yields.
    ""Repeating the 'around 5%' growth target despite a more
challenging external environment is a show of confidence as well
as an implication of stronger policy support for domestic demand
this year,"" said Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at
ING.
    ""We think there is quite a high likelihood of policy rollout
in the coming month or two. It will likely start with monetary
policy as the implementation is easier and faster C we expect a
rate cut and RRR cut in March or April.""
    China last cut its policy rate in September and benchmark
loan prime rates (LPRs) in October.    
        The yuan <CNY=CFXS> has fallen 2.5% against the dollar
since Trump's election win, hurt by rising trade tariffs and
broader disputes with the United States. 
        Beijing responded immediately on Tuesday as U.S.
President Donald Trump's doubling of duties on Chinese goods to
20% took effect, with additional tariffs of its own on certain
U.S. imports from March 10 and a series of new export
restrictions for designated U.S. entities.
    By 0358 GMT, the onshore yuan <CNY=CFXS> was 0.02% lower at
7.2625 per dollar, while its offshore counterpart <CNH=D3> also
eased to 7.2658.
    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China
(PBOC) set the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan
is allowed to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1714 per dollar, its
strongest since February 21 and 861 pips firmer than a Reuters'
estimate <CNY=RTRS> of 7.2575.
    The central bank has been setting its daily official
midpoint guidance stronger than market expectations since
mid-November, which markets interpret as a sign of unease over
the currency's decline.
    ""I'm still keeping my view that dollar/yuan will be kept
under 7.35,"" said Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at
Standard Chartered.
    Liu said devaluing the yuan has limited benefit given it is
""already very cheap on real effective exchange rate (REER)
basis.""
    However, Trump this week criticised China and Japan for
reducing the value of their currencies. Analysts say his remarks
are unfounded, given the yuan has been relatively strong in
trade-weighted terms and Beijing has made efforts to keep it
stable.

2025/3/5 3:46,中国汇市：人民币早盘升逾百点，中国经济目标符合预期汇率关键扰动在外部,"* 
      人民币早盘升逾百点，中间价创近两周新高
    

        * 
      中间价实际值和路透预测偏离仍超850点
    

        * 
      中国今年经济目标基本符合预期，关键不确定在外部
    

        * 
      “两会”时间人民币料以稳为主
    

  

       路透上海3月5日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周三早盘升逾百点；中间价小涨25点创近两周新高，仍较路透预测高出逾850点。交易员表示，美国加征关税后美元出现较大调整，对冲部分人民币的外部压力；不过关税对经济的冲击仍在，一旦外部压力回升，人民币仍可能向7.3元关口靠近。
    
    市场人士指出，中国政府工作报告设定的今年各项经济目标基本符合预期，未对人民币汇率带来直接扰动，后续更关注特朗普的关税政策以及美国经济表现对美元的影响。美元/人民币长端掉期套利需求和大行维稳操作形成良好对冲，长端掉期大概率延续当前的区间整理走势。
    
    “美元调整，人民币有些升值的，”一外资行交易员称，“不过关税问题还在，逢低购汇的需求不会少的，除非内外部条件再次配合，像去年9月那样把囤汇盘逼出来。”
    
    
    招商银行金融市场部最新观点认为，中国全国人大和政协“两会”正当时，人民币中间价持稳，预计人民币即期汇率的波幅会相对可控，依然维持区间震荡观点。
    
    渣打银行全球研究部中国宏观策略主管刘洁则提到，稳定的人民币汇率或是中美高层为数不多的共识，预计人民币仍不会跌破7.35元关口，另外人民币的实际有效汇率仍非常便宜，继续贬值的好处非常有限。
    
    随着美国提高对中加墨三国的关税水平，中加迅速展开反制，市场愈发认为特朗普并非空谈，因此开始考虑美国和全球经济增长放缓的因素。

    毕马威(KPMG)首席经济学家Diane Swonk称，关税的影响表面上看是一种价格冲击，但也可能开始扼杀需求，特别是如果消费者退缩，面临高度不确定性的企业抑制投资和招聘。
    
    星展银行也表示，加征关税引发对美国滞胀的担忧，并施压美元，但市场将关注美国后续经济数据和政策反应，以衡量美国经济是否能够吸收这些冲击。

    根据CME FedWatch Tool，美联储将在5月会议上降息的可能性周二一度攀升至50%以上，最新消化的可能性为45%，一周前为26%左右。
    
    
    中国日前发布芬太尼管控白皮书，指责美国在芬太尼问题上散布各种谎言。而美国商务部长卢特尼克表示，如果中加墨能够在阻止芬太尼流入方面取得进展，美国可能会取消这些关税。市场人士认为，这似乎为后续中美谈判提供了合作基础。
    
    另外消息人士称，特朗普政府和乌克兰计划签署一项备受争议的矿产协议，且德国同意设立5,000亿欧元基础设施基金，并将改革借贷规则以增加国防支出，这都帮助欧元反弹。
    
    全球汇市方面，德国就历史性的债务改革达成一致后，欧元周三升至近四个月来的最强水平。而最新针锋相对的关税举措加剧了美元近期的跌势。[FRX/CN]
    
    北京时间11:30，人民币兑美元即期报7.2658元，上日收报7.2788元，夜盘终报7.2608元。今日人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>报7.1714元，上日为7.1739元。截至目前人民币即期成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为168.03亿美元。

 ((catherine.tan@thomsonreuters.com;))"
2025/3/5 2:51,China's yuan steady as Beijing outlines 2025 goals,"SHANGHAI, March 5 (Reuters) - China's yuan held steady
against the dollar on Wednesday, as trade tensions with the
United States simmered even as Beijing outlined a steady
economic growth target and measured monetary easing for this
year.
    China kept its economic growth target for this year
unchanged at roughly 5% while committing more fiscal resources
than last year and lowering its inflation target, as the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's rubber-stamp
parliament, began its annual meeting on Wednesday.
    A government document prepared for the NPC annual meeting
showed China aims to keep the yuan stable, and ease monetary
policy slowly.
        Traders and analysts said the growth target against a
backdrop of Sino-U.S. tensions and weak sentiment meant monetary
settings, particularly the reserve ratio (RRR), will be reduced.
That could pressure the yuan further, given its relatively low
yields.
    ""Repeating the 'around 5%' growth target despite a more
challenging external environment is a show of confidence as well
as an implication of stronger policy support for domestic demand
this year,"" said Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at
ING.
    ""We think there is quite a high likelihood of policy rollout
in the coming month or two. It will likely start with monetary
policy as the implementation is easier and faster C we expect a
rate cut and RRR cut in March or April.""
    China last cut its policy rate in September and benchmark
loan prime rates (LPRs) in October.    
        The yuan <CNY=CFXS> has fallen 2.5% against the dollar
since Trump's election win, hurt by rising trade tariffs and
disputes with the United States. 
        Beijing responded immediately on Tuesday as U.S.
President Donald Trump's doubling of duties on Chinese goods to
20% took effect, with additional tariffs of its own on certain
U.S. imports from March 10 and a series of new export
restrictions for designated U.S. entities.
    By 0217 GMT, the onshore yuan <CNY=CFXS> was 0.09% weaker at
7.2676 per dollar, while its offshore counterpart <CNH=D3> also
eased to 7.2695.
    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China
(PBOC) set the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan
is allowed to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1714 per dollar, its
strongest since February 21 and 861 pips firmer than a Reuters'
estimate <CNY=RTRS> of 7.2575.
    The central bank has been setting its daily official
midpoint guidance stronger than market expectations since
mid-November, which markets interpret as a sign of unease over
the currency's decline.
    ""I'm still keeping my view that dollar/yuan will be kept
under 7.35,"" said Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at
Standard Chartered.
    ""There is limited incentive to move the line of defence
here, given stable yuan is one of the few agreeable issues
between Trump and Xi. China has kept interbank liquidity
conditions tighter to keep the yuan stable, as a sign of gesture
for a smooth start of the negotiations."" 
    However, Trump this week criticised China and Japan for
reducing the value of their currencies. Analysts say his remarks
are unfounded, given the yuan has been relatively strong in
trade-weighted terms and Beijing has made efforts to keep it
stable.

2025/3/5 1:16,人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>小升25点至7.1714元，创2月21日以来新高,"路透上海3月5日 - 人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周三报7.1714元，较上日的7.1739元小升25点，创2月21日以来新高，和路透预测偏离仍超850点；近期美元连续调整缓解人民币的外部压力，不过国内外汇市场供需仍失衡，监管层延续对单边预期的过滤，寻求后市中间价恢复弹性的机会。
    
    人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>上日收盘报7.2788元，夜盘终报7.2608元。离岸人民币即期<CNH=D3>最新报7.263元，上日收盘在7.2535元。稍早前路透测算今日人民币中间价大概会开在7.2575元附近，较上日贬值约836点，“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。
    
     中国十四届全国人大三次会议周三开幕。根据官方报告，中国2025年经济增速目标一如预期设定在“5%左右”，居民消费价格涨幅目标“2%左右”；目标城镇新增就业1,200万人以上、城镇调查失业率5.5%左右。
    

    渣打银行全球研究部中国宏观策略主管刘洁称，稳定的人民币汇率或是中美高层为数不多的共识，预计人民币仍不会跌破7.35关口，另外人民币的实际有效汇率仍非常便宜，继续贬值的好处非常有限。
    
    随着美国提高对中加墨三国的关税水平，中加随即展开反制，市场越来越相信特朗普是在行动而不是空谈，因此开始考虑美国和全球经济增长放缓的因素。

    毕马威(KPMG)首席经济学家Diane Swonk称，关税的影响表面上看是一种价格冲击，但也可能开始扼杀需求，特别是如果消费者退缩，面临高度不确定性的企业抑制投资和招聘。
    
    根据CME FedWatch Tool，美联储将在5月会议上降息的可能性周二一度攀升至50%以上，最新消化的可能性为45%，一周前为26%左右。
    
    
    中国日前还发布芬太尼管控白皮书，指责美国在芬太尼问题上散布各种谎言。而美国商务部长卢特尼克表示，如果中加墨能够在阻止芬太尼流入方面取得进展，美国可能会取消这些关税。市场人士认为，这似乎为后续中美谈判提供了合作基础。
    
    另外消息人士称，特朗普政府和乌克兰计划签署一项备受争议的矿产协议，且德国同意设立5,000亿欧元基础设施基金，并将改革借贷规则以增加国防支出，这都帮助欧元反弹。
    
    全球汇市方面，美元指数<.DXY>周三亚洲早盘继续保持偏弱走势，美国经济陷入滞胀的预期以及俄乌局势有缓解的可能都帮助施压美元，市场焦点转向中国“两会”以及美国非农报告。[FRX/CN](完)

2025/3/5 0:26,路透测算的人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>今日料开在7.2575元附近,"路透上海3月5日 - 路透根据中国外汇交易中心(CFETS)公布的人民币汇率形成机制测算，人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周三预计会开在7.2575元附近，较上日贬值约836点。

    德国债务规则改革消息助力欧元上涨，美元一路下跌，这明显缓解了人民币的外部压力；不过中美贸易战不断升级背景下，人民币仍存较大不确定性，监管料延续对中间价单边预期的过滤举措。
    
    上日人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>收报7.2788元，而中间价则为7.1739元。根据定价机制，今日中间价变动中，有1,049点下跌反映市场供求影响，另有213点上涨反映的是隔夜一篮子汇率基本保持不变所需要的点数；“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。

    路透测算的上日人民币兑美元中间价为7.2727元，和外汇交易中心公布的实际值偏差988点。上日路透根据CFETS公布的中间价测算，人民币汇率CFETS指数、参考SDR（特别提款权）篮子指数和参考BIS(国际清算银行)篮子指数分别为100.02、94.07和106.19。

    上日(截至北京时间次日凌晨3点)人民币兑美元即期累计成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为474.85亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

2025/3/4 23:22,"BUZZ-Asia Day Ahead-Trump headlines, regional data to lead","March 5 (Reuters) - Without a strong lead for Asian markets, newsflow
will dictate direction; EM ETFs closed up 0.85%. President Donald Trump will
address Congress at 0210 GMT, so expect headlines. 
    The busy regional data schedule includes Caixin China services PMI,
Australian GDP, Philippines inflation, and Indian HSBC services PMI. Bank of
Japan Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida will speak, and hold a news conference.
    As the U.S. and Ukraine prepare to sign a minerals deal, Zelenskiy pledges
to 'make things right'. U.S. commerce chief says Trump will meet Canada and
Mexico in the middle on tariffs. 
    In Europe, German parties unexpectedly agreed to propose a 'debt brake'
overhaul to finance a spending splurge. 
    Wall Street closed lower, long-end Treasury yields bounced, the U.S. dollar
fell due to euro strength, and commodities closed mixed.   
    Dow -1.55%, S&P -1.22%, and the Nasdaq -0.35%, capped by tariff-related
trade tensions.
    Treasury yields bounced, led by bunds after the German debt-break deal; 2yr
steady at 3.984%, 10yr +6bp to 4.246% and 30yr +8bp to 4.542% on TradeWeb.
    Oil fell, Brent -1.15%, WTI -0.8% on the OPEC+ output increase. U.S. copper
-0.75% as tariff tensions escalate. Gold +0.7% supported by safe-haven demand
and the lower USD.
    The U.S. dollar <=USD> fell 0.9%, led by EUR/USD +1.3% after the German
spending agreement. GBP +0.75%, USD/CNH -0.65%, AUD +0.7%, NZD +0.9% and USD/CAD
-0.55%. USD/JPY +0.2% was the exception, supported by rising Treasury yields.

2025/3/4 15:06,"ОБОБЩЕНИЕ-Рубль сник на МОЕХ из-за сезонности и обвала нефти, но стоек на FX","МОСКВА, 4 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль во вторник подешевел на
Мосбирже с учетом потенциальных рисков для российской валюты от
падения нефти на пятимесячные минимумы, а также с оглядкой на
негативную сезонность начала календарного месяца. Параллельно
рубль подрастает на форексе против доллара и евро с опорой на
позитивный в целом свежий геополитический новостной фон.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 17.45 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 12,19, и российская валюта
теряет 0,8%.
    Беспоставочные однодневные фьючерсные контракты на пары
юань/рубль, доллар/рубль, евро/рубль на Мосбирже к 17.45 МСК
котировались вблизи отметок 12,20, 90,20 и 94,60 соответственно,
и рубль теряет 0,5% к юаню, 0,2% к доллару и 0,5% к евро.
    Центробанк с учетом совершавшихся сегодня на российских
биржевом и внебиржевом рынках сделок установил официальные
курсы: 12,19 рубля за юань, 89,24 за доллар и 93,90 за евро
против действовавших 12,17, 89,25 и 92,85 соответственно. 
    На внешних рынках пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 17.45 МСК
котировалась по 89,25, и рубль набирает 0,5% процента, согласно
данным LSEG. 
    В динамике рублевого курса валюты США может отражаться и
текущее снижение индекса доллара <=USD> до трехмесячного
минимума из-за опасений замедления роста американской экономики
после начала торговой войны США с Канадой, Мексикой и Китаем.
    Евро к рублю <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 93,95, и
рубль дорожает на 0,1%. 
    Локально против рубля играет сезонный фактор снижения продаж
экспортной валютной выручки после уплаты ежемесячных налогов.
    Одновременно базовые нефтяные сорта дешевеют третий день

2025/3/4 14:44,BUZZ-FX options wrap - Shifting outlooks and simmering risks,"FX option markets reflect worries about FX volatility relating to trade tariffs,
political developments and shifting policy outlooks. That comes after newly
implemented trade tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China boosted related option
implied volatilities. 
    Although significant, USD/CAD implied volatility gains failed to threaten
highs from early February - benchmark 1-month spiked 8.9 to 10.0 Monday-Tuesday
before quickly falling to 8.5. 1-month USD/MXN reached 14.3 from 13.3 and
remains firm - its biggest premium to 1-month historic volatility since the U.S.
election. USD/CNH implied volatility gains were more limited with 1-month
already trading 3-week highs, yet still 1.0 below a February 3 peak of 6.25.
    EUR/USD implied volatility remains well supported above recent and longer-
term lows. Risk reversals retreat from higher levels for EUR puts over calls
amid spot gains above 1.0500, but retain enough premium to highlight simmering
downside fears. 
    Big EUR/USD strikes expiring in the 1.05's may exert a greater influence on
FX if all else fails to excite before Friday's U.S. jobs data. Price action
still shows a lack of conviction for a protracted EUR/USD upleg beyond 1.0600
near term.
    Other recent trade data of interest includes CHF call options expiring after
Wednesday's CHF CPI print, hinting at a higher perceived potential for firmer
numbers leading to a higher CHF. There's been light demand for various GBP call
strikes against EUR and USD. 
    USD/JPY options maintained conviction for sub 150.00 JPY call strikes when
spot retested highs above 151.00 Friday/Monday. That proved founded amid a
downside resumption to longer term lows sub 148.56 on Tuesday. One-month expiry
implied volatility and the JPY call over put premium on 1-month risk reversals
traded new highs since December at 11.5 and 1.75 respectively. 
    Traders are still buying outright JPY call/USD put options, but its worth
noting that some have attached knock-out triggers from 145.00, suggesting a
perception of that level proving tougher to crack near term.

рынков идут вниз во вторник - аппетит инвесторов к риску ослаб
после вступления в силу новых торговых пошлин президента США
Дональда Трампа в отношении Канады, Китая и Мексики,
ознаменовавших начало новых конфликтов в мировой торговле. Между
тем индекс валют немного укрепляется.
    Индекс акций развивающихся рынков MSCI к 14:19 МСК <.MSCIEF>
опустился на 0,32%, удерживаясь вблизи минимума одного месяца, а
индекс валют <.MIEM00000CUS> вырос на 0,2%.
    Трамп во вторник ввел новые пошлины в размере 25% на товары,
ввозимые в США из Мексики и Канады, одновременно повысив вдвое -
до 20% - тарифы на китайский импорт.
    Мексиканский песо <MXN=> опустился на 0,77% до 20,86 за
доллар, ранее в ходе сессии достигнув минимума одного месяца.
    ""Движение мексиканского песо зависит от длительности и
окончательного масштаба тарифов. Если они будут удерживаться на
уровне в 25%, то мексиканский песо может ослабнуть выше 21 (песо
за доллар), уже значительно ослабнув с середины 2024 года"", -
сказали аналитики Societe Generale.
    Канада и Мексика намерены незамедлительно ввести ответные
меры против США.
    Пекин сразу же ответил дополнительными пошлинами в размере
10%-15% на определенные виды импорта из США, которые начнут
действовать с 10 марта, и рядом новых экспортных ограничений для
отдельных американских организаций.
    Юань на офшорном рынке <CNH=> подорожал 0,35% до 7,276. 
    Акции в Тайване <.TWII> и Гонконге <.HSI> просели вслед за
сильным спадом на Уолл-стрит накануне.
    Фондовый индекс Польши <.WIG20> снизился на 2,6%, а польский
злотый в паре с евро <EURPLN=> - на 0,13% до 4,16.
    Фондовый индекс Чехии <.PX> к 14:04 МСК опустился на 1,85%,
в то время как чешская крона в паре с евро <EURCZK=> подешевела
на 0,29% до 25,05.
    Индекс венгерских акций <.BUX> снизился на 1,95%.
    Венгерский форинт <EURHUF=> и румынский лей <EURRON=> в паре
с евро не показывали ярко выраженной динамики в преддверии
вероятного снижения ставок ЕЦБ позже на этой неделе. 
    Южноафриканский ранд <ZAR=> подорожал на 0,35% до 18,57 за

2025/3/4 9:01,Asian stocks fall after China responded to U.S. trade moves with tariffs,"Asian stocks fall after China responded to U.S. trade moves with tariffsAsia-Pacific markets mostly in red tracking a sharp decline in US stocks overnight as caution lingered amid worries of a global trade war, following China and Canada's plans for retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, further escalating global trade tensions. China introduced tariffs on US goods and other trade measures on Tuesday in response to US President Donald Trump's move to raise tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20% from 10%.

Japan (NKY:IND) fell 1.34% to close at 37,331, while the broader Topix Index dropped 0.71% to 2,710 on Tuesday, erasing gains from the previous session. The Japanese yen strengthened toward 149 per dollar on Tuesday, approaching a five-month-high.

Japan's unemployment rate was at 2.5% in January 2025, slightly above market estimates and December's readings of 2.4%.

Japanese companies reduced capital spending on plant and equipment by 0.2% year-on-year in Q4 of 2024, missing market expectations of a 4.9% increase and swinging from the strongest growth in three quarters of 8.1% in Q3.

The consumer confidence index in Japan unexpectedly declined to 35.0 in February 2025, down from 35.2 in the previous month, below market expectations of 35.7.

China (SHCOMP) rose 0.25% closing at 3,324, while the Shenzhen Component rose 0.28% to 10,679 on Tuesday, recovering earlier losses as investors assessed the impact of new tariffs, and the offshore yuan strengthened around 7.28 per dollar.

The Trump administration's additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods took effect today, raising total US tariffs on China to 20%. In response, Beijing immediately announced new tariffs of 10%-15% on certain US imports, set to take effect on March 10, and imposed export restrictions on US firms.

This new tariffs coincide with the start of a key annual political meeting in China this week. The country is anticipated to roll out fresh stimulus measures to help its economy withstand the impact of the increased tariffs.

Hong Kong (HSI) fell 0.44% to 22,631 in the Tuesday morning session, following modest gains in the prior day.

India (SENSEX) fell 0.19% to 72,846 in morning trade on Tuesday, retreating for the third straight session and staying at their lowest level since early June 2024 amid losses in the tech sector, consumer goods, auto, and pharmaceuticals.

Australia (AS51) fell 0.58% to close at 8,189 on Tuesday, nearing its lowest level in two months. The Australian dollar slipped to around $0.62 on Tuesday, nearing a one-month low, after minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's February meeting revealed that policymakers were focused on downside risks to the economy, signaling a more dovish stance.

Retail sales in Australia increased by 0.3% month-on-month in January 2025, shifting from a 0.1% decline in the previous month and matching market expectations.

Australia's current account deficit declined to AUD 12.5 billion in Q4 2024 from a downwardly revised AUD 13.9 billion shortfall in Q3.

In the U.S., on Monday, all three major indexes ended in red prompted by US President Trump's confirmation that tariffs on key trading partners would take effect today.

U.S. stock futures : Dow -0.01%; S&P 500 +0.07%; Nasdaq +0.16%.

Investors are now focused on Friday's monthly jobs report for fresh insights into the labor market.

Currencies: (JPY:USD), (CNY:USD), (AUD:USD), (INR:USD), (HKD:USD), (NZD:USD).

 (新增评论及收盘报价)
       路透上海/北京3月4日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周二收升逾140点创近一周
新高，中间价小升脱离一个半月低点，和路透预测偏离仍近千点。交易员表示，美国对华加
征20%关税生效，但人民币未现波澜，除中间价持稳外，美国总统特朗普表态“中日不能继
续让本币贬值”也在一定程度上减轻人民币外部压力。
    
    他们并指出，中国已进入“两会”时间，中间价稳中偏升，显示监管层有意在会议期间
维稳人民币汇率，短期汇价料持稳以应对内外部不确定性。
    
    “现在是两会时期，人民币大概率保持稳定，”一外资行交易员称，会议结束后再通过
观察中间价变动来看关税的影响是否会反映在汇价中。
         
    
    一中资行交易员则表示，中间价还是很稳，估计人民币还是跟着美指波动，人民币甚至
有可能小幅升值。
        
    马来亚银行最新观点称，稳定的中间价是一个信号，显示政策制定者倾向于维持人民币
汇率的稳定，以在会议期间给予金融市场稳定感；虽然美国的关税威胁会令人民币承压，但
稳定的中间价及特朗普的抱怨无疑减轻了人民币的压力，使人民币得以“追赶”日元。
        
    美国总统特朗普周一表示，对来自墨西哥和加拿大的商品征收25%的关税，并对所有中
国进口产品加征的关税从之前的10%提高到20%，这项关税将于周二生效。特朗普还称，他告
诉日本和中国领导人，他们不能继续降低本国货币的价值，因为这样做对美国不公平。
    
    中国国务院关税税则委员会周二公告称，自3月10日起，对原产于美国的部分进口商品
加征关税。其中，对鸡肉、小麦、玉米、棉花加征15%关税；对高粱、大豆、猪肉、牛肉、
水产品、水果、蔬菜、乳制品加征10%关税。
        
    美国供应管理协会（ISM）隔夜发布的调查中，制造业PMI从1月的50.9下滑至2月的50.3
，而美国对贸易伙伴加征关税，造成了不确定的经营环境。
    
    近期一连串疲软的经济数据也推高了人们对美联储(FED)可能会更积极降息的预期。市
场预计美联储今年将降息67个基点，而此前的观点认为美联储将降息不到50个基点。接下来
市场将关注周四的欧洲央行政策会议和周五的美国就业报告。

2025/3/4 8:47,Юань растерял часть подъема после вступления в силу пошлин США,"ШАНХАЙ, 4 мар (Рейтер) - Китайский юань потерял во
вторник часть показанного ранее роста по отношению к доллару
после вступления в силу новых пошлин США на китайские товары:
торговая война способна подавить импульс в нестабильной
экономике.
    США во вторник повысили вдвое - до 20% - тарифы на китайский
импорт. Пекин сразу же ответил введением дополнительных пошлин в
размере 10%-15% на определенные виды импорта из США, которые
начнут действовать с 10 марта, и рядом новых экспортных
ограничений для отдельных американских организаций.
    Тем не менее, похоже, валютный рынок в основном спокоен
после введения зеркальных тарифов, сказали трейдеры: юань на
материковом рынке растерял лишь часть скромного утреннего роста.
    Спотовый юань в Китайской системе валютной торговли SFETS на
материковом рынке <CNY=CFXS> к 10:39 МСК был стабилен у отметки
7,2825?, отступив с внутридневного максимума в 7,2763 юаня за
$1. На офшорном рынке <CNH=> валюта подорожала на 0,19% до
7,2875.  
    Центробанк Китая оказывал поддержку валютному рынку начиная
с середины ноября, постоянно объявляя официальный фиксинг
сильнее рыночных прогнозов, что аналитики и трейдеры расценивают
как официальную попытку сохранить ренминби стабильным.
    ""Тем не менее, мы ожидаем, что китайские власти в конечном
счете допустят коррекцию ренминби в ответ на значительные
пошлины, как свидетельствует опыт торговой войны 2018/2019
годов"", - говорится в записке аналитиков Nomura.
    Перед открытием сессии ЦБ Китая объявил срединный
фиксированный курс <CNY=PBOC> на уровне 7,1739 за доллар - на 6
pips (десятитысячных долей процентного пункта) сильнее
предыдущего фиксинга в 7,1745. При этом значение оказалось на
988 pips сильнее приведенного Рейтер прогноза аналитиков
<CNY=RTRS> в 7,2727.

       路透上海3月4日 - 短短一个月特朗普再次对华加征关税，中国继续采取反制措施，中美双方博弈升级；不过相较贸易战1.0时期人民币表现更显平稳；市场人士指出，特朗普挥动关税大棒，伤敌一千自损八百，短期中间价可能继续持稳应对，中期看人民币汇率仍存调整空间。
    
    “目前中间价很稳，估计短期人民币还是跟着美指波动，”一中资行交易员表示。
    
    瑞穗亚洲首席策略师张建泰认为，考虑到特朗普对人民币贬值的警告，中国央行或会避免调整中间价维稳举措。“两会”期间预计央行会维护汇率稳定，“美国关税的不确定性将使在岸人民币承压，但下行空间将限制在7.31附近。”
    
    人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周二高开高走，盘中汇价一度升至7.2763元，人民币中间价<CNY=PBOC>则暂时脱离一个半月低点，和路透预测偏离收窄至不足千点，凸显监管仍着力稳定市场，未受外部不确定性扰动。
    
    法巴大中华区外汇和利率策略主管Ju WANG亦表示，面对美国的加码关税举措，目前尚不清楚中国央行是否会将人民币中间价放宽至7.2以下；若美元走弱，人民币对一揽子货币会跟随走弱，这比直接兑美元走弱更有利，“鉴于中国产品巨大价格优势，上调20-30%的关税是可以吸收的。”
    
    中国周二午后宣布反制措施，包括对部分美国肉类、农产品等加征10-15%的关税，并禁止美国因美纳公司向中国出口基因测序仪；将莱多斯公司等15家美国实体列入出口管制管控名单。
    
    市场人士指出，接下来中美贸易战2.0仍有升级空间，例如4月初的贸易审查截止，4月2日的对等关税，包括4月5日的TikTok出售延续到期等。因此“两会”期间，中国央行可能继续保持对中间价过滤来稳定预期，但这无法一直使用。
    
    野村就指出，除非中国人大会议以更大规模的财政刺激方案给市场带来意外惊喜，或者中国央行愿意继续消耗外汇储备，否则中国将允许人民币贬值以应对美国大幅加征的关税。
    
    
    **这次不一样？**
    
    不过有市场人士指出，中美贸易战2.0和18-19年的1.0版各所处背景并不相同，当前美国经济也有转弱的可能，美元也可能阶段性承压；关键是此次美国加征关税不仅仅针对中国，而是主要贸易伙伴都加征关税，这无形中也缓解了人民币的压力。
    
    “美国加征关税与美元走软同时出现，对人民币而言，情况没那么糟糕。”瑞穗张建泰称， 在特朗普2.0伊始，如此大规模的贸易战可能会导致美国供应链和投资计划受挫，最终会限制特朗普关税政策的规模。

    华侨银行亚洲宏观研究主管谢栋铭也表示，汇率是相对概念，关税也是相对概念，如果其他国家也被征收或者有预期被征收关税，相比针对单个国家压力会小很多，“就怕一个人(国家)扛，如果美国每个人(国家)都收，就当交保护费了。”
    
    另一位市场人士表示，当前美元本身也不强，人民币跟着美元波动，相对一揽子货币已经在贬值了，目前的情况看似乎人民币相比18年那会更具韧性。
    
    近期美国公布的一系列经济数据显示，美国经济没有之前那么强，而不断加码关税可能推高通胀，增长乏力的情况下，“滞胀”的可能性也在上升，年内美联储降息次数从2月初的一次上升至当前的三次。
    
    特朗普最新宣布自3月4日起对加墨(价值9,000亿美元)加征25%的关税，对中国继续加征10%关税(价值4,500亿美元)，如果考虑4月可能采取的对等关税，以及对华进一步加码关税的可能，美国陷入滞胀的风险不断上升。
    
    星展银行就表示，美国不断加征关税可能会提高通胀预期，市场对美国经济增长的担忧可能会更高。(完)

2025/3/4 7:07,"FOREX-""Канадец"", мексиканский песо ослабли до минимума 1 мес после введения тарифов США","СИНГАПУР, 4 мар (Рейтер) - Канадский доллар и
мексиканский песо во вторник опустились до минимальных значений
за месяц после того, как президент США Дональд Трамп ввел
пошлины против Канады, Мексики и Китая, превратив опасения о
торговой войне в реальность.
    Китай через несколько минут после введения тарифов сообщил о
введении дополнительных пошлин в размере 10%-15% на определенные
виды импорта из США с 10 марта.
    Канадский доллар <CAD=> к 09:14 МСК подешевел на 0,1% по
отношению к доллару США до 1,4492, ранее в ходе торгов
отметившись на месячном минимуме в 1,45415 за $1. 
    Мексиканский песо <MXN=> опустился на 0,24% до 20,74 за
доллар, достигнув минимума с 3 февраля.
    Пошлины спровоцировали ралли на рынке гособлигаций США: на
торгах в Азии доходность индикативных 10-летних treasuries
<US10YT=RR> упала до 4,115%, самого низкого уровня с 22 октября.
Доходность бондов движется обратно цене. 
    ""Решение Трампа ввести пошлины против Мексики и Канады
воплотило страхи в реальность"", - сказал Васу Менон из OCBC.
    Пошлины встряхнут рынки, считает аналитик, поскольку
инвесторы опасаются роста инфляционных ожиданий и замедления
экономического роста США, ведь на Канаду, Китай и Мексику
приходится значительная часть американского импорта.
    ""Есть добавочный риск, что на ответные меры Канады и Мексики
Трамп отреагирует еще большим наращиванием напряженности и
вызовет еще больше тревожности (на рынке)"", - сказал Менон.
    Оттава ввела ответные пошлины на товары из США, которые
вступили в силу во вторник в 08:01 МСК.
    Индекс доллара к корзине из шести основных валют <=USD> к
09:14 МСК был малоподвижен на уровне 106,6?.
    Евро <EUR=> отступил на 0,07% до $1,0479?. Британский фунт
<GBP=> опустился на 0,1% до $1,2688?. Японская иена <JPY=> к
доллару подорожала на 0,11%? до 149,34.
    Юань на материковом рынке <CNY=D3> был малоподвижен, вблизи?
7,2845?, на офшорном рынке <CNH=> - подорожал на 0,15% до
7,2904. 
    Между тем биткоин <BTC=> снизился на 1,52% до $83.991,79,
эфириум <ETH=> опустился на 0,54% до $2.098,68.

2025/3/4 6:55,Рубль тяготеет к росту в надежде на деэскалацию и невзирая на падение нефти,"МОСКВА, 4 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль утром вторника тяготеет к
росту на внешних рынках с опорой на текущий новостной фон,
дающий надежду на геополитическую деэскалацию, при этом пока
игнорируется падение нефти до минимумов с начала декабря.
    После открытия валютных торгов Мосбиржи будет отыгрываться
не только новостная повестка, но и баланс текущих реальных
денежных потоков, в том числе и сезонное сокращение продаж
экспортной выручки в начале месяца после уплаты очередных
корпоративных налогов.
    Пара доллар/рубль <RUB=> к 9.35 МСК котировалась на форексе
по 89,20, рубль набирает 0,6% от уровней закрытия понедельника,
по итогам которого он подешевел на 0,4%.
    Пара евро/рубль <EURRUB=> котируется по 93,99, и рубль
набирает 0,1% от закрытия понедельника, по итогам которого
российская валюта потеряла 1,4%.
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> котируется на форексе по 12,16 -
здесь рубль дешевеет на 0,1% от последних вчерашних показателей
LSEG.
    Вчерашние же торги Мосбиржи парой юань/рубль расчетами
""завтра"" завершились на уровне 12,10 рубля за юань - российская
валюта в итоге набрала 0,1% при объеме сделок в 110 миллиардов
рублей, но при этом интрадэй она дешевела до 10-дневного
минимума, отметки 12,26.
    Рубль накануне страдал от негативного эффекта на фоне
снижения продаж экспортной выручки, а также раздражителем для
него выступило усиление геополитической неопределенности после
пятничных переговоров Вашингтона и Киева, которые не привели к
каким-либо договоренностям и ухудшили перспективы быстрого
заключения мирной сделки в украинском конфликте.
    Тем не менее, поддержкой рублю остаются надежды на улучшение
отношений Кремля с новой администрацией Белого дома, которые
подпитываются сейчас в основном сигналами с американской
стороны.
    В частности, накануне вечером стало известно, что Белый дом
попросил Госдеп и Минфин США подготовить список санкций, которые
могут быть смягчены при новых переговорах американских
официальных лиц с российскими представителями в ближайшие дни.
    Также как позитивный фактор российские рынки могут оценивать
свежее решение Дональда Трампа приостановить всю военную помощь
США Украине.
    Параллельно локальные рынки будут оценивать потенциальное
влияние торговых войн, на которые пошли Штаты, все-таки
установившие пошлины в размере 25% на товары из Канады и
Мексики, а также удвоившие пошлины на товары из Китая, с 10% до
20%.
    Пока реакция форекса на это решение США сдержанная:
мексиканский песо теряет в цене четверть процента (20,74)
<MXN=>, канадский доллар почти не меняется (1,4480) <CAD=>,
китайский юань также почти не меняется на континентальном рынке
КНР (7,2838) <CNY=> и даже немного дорожает на офшорном (7,2895)
<CNH=>.
    Более яркие события проходят на рынке нефти, где базовые
сорта дешевеют третий день подряд, накануне потери североморской
смеси Brent <LCOc1> превысили два процента, сегодня она
снижается на две трети процента и котируется сейчас по $71,10 за
баррель, ранее достигнув отметки $70,89 впервые с 6 декабря.
    Нефть дешевеет на фоне сообщений, что ОПЕК+ проведет
запланированное увеличение добычи в апреле на 138.000 баррелей в
сутки, и это станет первым расширением картелем своих поставок с
2022 года.
    Дополнительным фактором, влияющим на цены на нефть, стало
решение Дональда Трампа прекратить военную помощь Украине,
поскольку рынки расценивают дистанцирование Вашингтона от Киева
как признак потенциального смягчения российской-украинского
конфликта, что, в свою очередь, может привести к ослаблению
санкций против Москвы и возвращению на рынок большего объема
поставок нефти.

2025/3/4 6:26,China's yuan pares some gains after US tariffs kick in,"(Adds tariff details, updates prices)
       SHANGHAI, March 4 (Reuters) - China's yuan pared some
earlier gains against the dollar on Tuesday after fresh U.S.
tariffs on Chinese goods kicked in, heightening trade tensions
and threatening to put more pressure on the uneven economy.
    The United States doubled trade tariffs on Chinese goods to
20% on Tuesday, and Beijing quickly said it will impose
additional tariffs of 10%-15% on certain U.S. imports from March
10 as retaliation.
        But the currency market largely appeared calm following
the tit-for-tat measures, traders said, with the onshore yuan
only giving back some of its modest morning gains.
  
        As of 0551 GMT, the onshore yuan <CNY=CFXS> was 0.07%
higher at 7.2826, down from an intraday high of 7.2763.
        It offshore counterpart <CNH=D3> traded at 7.2867 yuan
around 0551 GMT.
  
        The central bank had continued to guide the currency
firmer hours ahead of the expected imposition of the U.S.
tariffs.
  
    The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has been offering support
for the currency market by persistently setting
firmer-than-expected midpoint fixings since mid-November, with
traders and analysts interpreting the moves as an official
attempt to keep the yuan steady.
    ""However, we expect the Chinese authorities to eventually
allow RMB to adjust in response to significant tariffs as
evident in the 2018/2019 trade war experiences,"" analysts at
Nomura said in a note.
    Trade tensions had been one of the key drags on the yuan
during Donald Trump's first term as president. A series of
tit-for-tat U.S.-China tariff announcements drove the Chinese
currency down more than 12% against the dollar between March
2018 and May 2020.
    The yuan has lost 11.7% of its value against the dollar
since Trump left office the first time in January 2021.
    Prior to the market opening, the PBOC set the midpoint rate
<CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed to trade in a 2%
band, at 7.1739 per dollar, 6 pips firmer than the previous fix
of 7.1745, albeit against a broadly stronger dollar in global
markets.
    Tuesday's official midpoint was 988 pips firmer than a
Reuters estimate <CNY=RTRS> of 7.2727.
    ""We see the central bank will likely continue to anchor the
spot with its daily fixing and look at yuan strength on a basket
level (against many trading partners' currencies), especially
this week as Two Sessions start,"" said Lemon Zhang, FX
strategist at Barclays.
        Zhang expects the yuan to swing between 7.25 and 7.3 in
the near term. 
  
        Parliamentarians and political advisers gather in
Beijing every March for two parallel sets of meetings called the
Lianghui or ""Two Sessions,"" where key economic growth targets
and the policy agenda will be unveiled.
  
    Trump said on Monday he told the leaders of Japan and China
they cannot continue to reduce the value of their currencies as
doing so would be unfair to the United States. 
    Analysts at BofA revised their forecasts for the yuan
slightly higher to 7.5 at the end of the first quarter from 7.6
previously, while maintaining end-June predictions at 7.6.
        ""We maintain that U.S. tariff risks and technology
restrictions should not be underestimated with April 1 tariff
headlines still looming,"" they said in a note published last
week.
  
        ""Consequently, we still hold a bearish view into 2Q and
maintain a USD/CNY forecast of 7.60. The risk to this view is
that China either achieves a negotiation pathway to hold of
tariffs or engages in more aggressive stimulus to lift growth
expectations.""

2025/3/4 4:26,China's yuan inches higher on PBOC support as US tariffs loom,"(Adds details, comments; updates prices)
       SHANGHAI, March 4 (Reuters) - 
    China's yuan inched higher against the dollar on Tuesday as
the central bank continued to guide the currency firmer hours
ahead of the expected imposition of more U.S. tariffs.
  
    The United States is expected to raise tariffs on Chinese
goods by 10% at 0501 GMT on Tuesday, on top of the 10% tariffs
imposed in February. Market participants will closely monitor
the developments of the tariffs and possible retaliation from
China.
    The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has been offering support
for the currency market by persistently setting
firmer-than-expected midpoint fixings since mid-November, with
traders and analysts interpreting the moves as an official
attempt to keep the yuan steady.
        ""However, we expect the Chinese authorities to

        Trade tensions had been one of the key drags on the yuan

        As of 0350 GMT, the onshore yuan <CNY=CFXS> was 0.12%
higher at 7.2796 per dollar.
  
        Its offshore counterpart <CNH=D3> traded at 7.2850
around midday, after briefly weakening past the key 7.3 level.
  
        Prior to the market opening, the PBOC set the midpoint
rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan is allowed to trade in a
2% band, at 7.1739 per dollar, 6 pips firmer than the previous
fix of 7.1745, albeit against a broadly stronger dollar in
global markets.
    Tuesday's official midpoint was 988 pips firmer than a

    Trump said on Monday he told the leaders of Japan and China
they cannot continue to reduce the value of their currencies as
doing so would be unfair to the United States. 
    ""The fix has been sending a signal that policymakers
continue to prefer currency stability,"" Maybank analysts said in
a note.
        ""That may be meant to maintain goodwill with Trump as
well as a sense of stability for the financial markets as the
Two Sessions in China kicks off with the start of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) today.""

2025/3/4 3:40,《汇市短评》中国政策观察：削弱人民币汇率不大可能是刺激选项之一,"路透3月4日 - 在本周备受瞩目的中国全国人大会议即将召开之际，中国的政策制定者显然有几种刺激方案可供选择。但削弱人民币汇率以增强出口竞争力不太可能是其中之一。

    全国人大会议将于周三开幕，并将制定主要的经济目标。中国人民政治协商会议将于周二起召开。
    
    中国政府承诺刺激内需，因此很可能会减税和发放消费券。为了提振消费者信心，可能会宣布更多措施来支撑房地产价值和股市--通过对民营企业的额外支持。
    
    尽管 2 月份的制造业采购经理人指数(PMI)有所回升，但预计政府的预算赤字将会增加，而且可能会有进一步放松货币政策的暗示。

    虽然指标利率可能会再次下调，但从中国央行将美元兑人民币中间价锚定在 7.1700 附近来看，当局可能会继续维护人民币汇率。央行还下调了银行美元存款利率，并加大了对资本外流的审查力度。

    为提振出口而削弱人民币汇率的问题在于，这不仅会阻碍最近因中国人工智能的进步而转向乐观的外国投资者，还可能破坏与美国进行贸易谈判的任何希望；美国总统特朗普周二明确警告不要让人民币贬值。

       路透上海3月4日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周二早盘高开后震荡上行；中间价小升脱离一个半月低点，和路透预测偏离仍近千点。交易员表示，随着中国进入全国人大和政协“两会”时间，人民币大概率持稳来应对内外部的不确定性。
    
    市场人士指出，市场等待美国关税落地，由于担心美国陷入滞胀，美元指数<.DXY>和美债收益率均承压回落，人民币的外部压力部分缓解，后续需关注中加墨如何反制。
    
    “若关税生效，又没有风险改善的利好，估计人民币还是要贬，”一外资行交易员称，“目前买盘估计在观望。”
    
    
    另一中资行交易员则表示，中间价还是很稳，估计人民币还是跟着美指波动，人民币甚至有可能小幅升值。
        
    马来亚银行认为，当中美的贸易冲突恶化时，人民币或被允许走弱，不过在“两会”期间，人民币还是会保持稳定。
    
    美国总统特朗普周一表示，对来自墨西哥和加拿大的商品征收25%的关税，并对所有中国进口产品加征的关税从之前的10%提高到20%，这项关税将于周二生效。特朗普还称，日本和中国不能继续让本币贬值，因为这对美国不公。而中国商务部周二称，将采取反制措施坚定维护自身权益。
        
    美国供应管理协会（ISM）隔夜发布的调查中，制造业PMI从1月的50.9下滑至2月的50.3，而美国对贸易伙伴加征关税，造成了不确定的经营环境。
    
    近期一连串疲软的经济数据也推高了人们对美联储(FED)可能会更积极降息的预期。市场预计美联储今年将降息67个基点，而此前的观点认为美联储将降息不到50个基点。接下来市场将关注周四的欧洲央行政策会议和周五的美国就业报告。
    
    
    全球汇市方面，加元和墨西哥披索周二徘徊在一个月低点附近。美国总统特朗普表示，对来自这两个邻国的商品(价值超过9,000亿美元)征收25%的关税将于周二生效，贸易战的担忧打压了市场情绪。[FRX/CN]

2025/3/4 3:16,BUZZ-COMMENT-China Policy Watch-Yuan isn't a stimulus option,"March 4 (Reuters) - China clearly has several stimulus options available
as policymakers head into a much-anticipated parliamentary meeting this week.
Weakening the yuan to support export competitiveness is unlikely to be one of
them.
    The top legislative body, the National People's Congress (NPC), convenes on
Wednesday and will set key economic targets. The political advisory body, the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) meets from Tuesday.
    With Beijing's pledge to spur domestic demand, income-boosting tax
reductions and consumption vouchers look likely. To lift consumer confidence,
more steps to shore up property values and the stock market - via extra support
for private enterprises - might be announced. 
    An increase in the government's budget deficit is expected, and there could
be hints at further monetary policy easing, despite February's uptick in 
manufacturing PMIs.
    While benchmark interest rates could be lowered again, authorities will
likely continue to defend the yuan, judging by the People's Bank of China
anchoring of the daily USD/CNY benchmark rate near 7.1700. The central bank has
also nudged bank USD deposit rates lower and there is increasing scrutiny of
capital outflows.
    The trouble with weakening the yuan to help exports isn't just that it would
deter foreign investors, who have recently turned optimistic due to Chinese AI
advances. It could also derail any hope of trade talks with the U.S.; President
Donald Trump explicitly warned against yuan devaluation on Tuesday.

2025/3/4 1:57,China's yuan holds steady as PBOC lends support through firmer fixing,"SHANGHAI, March 4 (Reuters) - China's yuan held steady
against the dollar on Tuesday as the central bank continued a
strengthening bias in its daily official guidance, with the
market interpreting it as an attempt to prevent the Chinese
currency from sliding.
    The yuan has faced renewed depreciation pressure, weighed
down by heightened trade tensions with the United States, after
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday encouraged
Canada to follow Mexico in matching U.S. tariffs on Chinese
goods.
    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China
(PBOC) set the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan
is allowed to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1739 per dollar, 6 pips
firmer than the previous fix of 7.1745, albeit against a broadly
stronger dollar in global markets.
    Tuesday's official midpoint was 988 pips firmer than a
Reuters estimate <CNY=RTRS> of 7.2727.
    U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he told the
leaders of Japan and China they cannot continue to reduce the
value of their currencies as doing so would be unfair to the
United States. 
    China's central bank has set its official guidance on the
firmer side of market projections since mid-November, which
analysts and traders see as a sign of unease over the yuan's
decline.
    As of 0132 GMT, the onshore yuan <CNY=CFXS> was 0.01% higher
at 7.2870 to the dollar, compared with the previous close of
7.2880.
    Its offshore counterpart <CNH=D3> traded at 7.2927 after
briefly weakening past the key 7.3 level.

2025/3/4 0:27,路透测算的人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>今日料开在7.2727元附近,"路透上海3月4日 - 路透根据中国外汇交易中心(CFETS)公布的人民币汇率形成机制测算，人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周二预计会开在7.2727元附近，较上日贬值约982点。

    隔夜美国公布的经济数据低于市场预期，且乌克兰和平协议有达成希望，美指<.DXY>和美债收益率震荡回落，人民币的外部压力有所缓解，不过在关税不断加码的压力下人民币很难摆脱颓势，中国“两会”召开在即，监管料延续对单边预期的过滤举措，助力稳定市场预期。
    
    上日人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>收报7.2931元，而中间价则为7.1745元。根据定价机制，今日中间价变动中，有1,186点下跌反映市场供求影响，另有204点上涨反映的是隔夜一篮子汇率基本保持不变所需要的点数；“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。

    路透测算的上日人民币兑美元中间价为7.2857元，和外汇交易中心公布的实际值偏差1,112点。上日路透根据CFETS公布的中间价测算，人民币汇率CFETS指数、参考SDR（特别提款权）篮子指数和参考BIS(国际清算银行)篮子指数分别为100.17、94.37和106.47。

    上日(截至北京时间次日凌晨3点)人民币兑美元即期累计成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为397.26亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

2025/3/4 0:00,Offshore Yuan Rises as PBOC Supports,"Offshore Yuan Rises as PBOC SupportsThe offshore yuan strengthened to around 7.28 per dollar as the People’s Bank of China continued supporting the currency amid the implementation of US tariffs. President Donald Trump signed an order raising a previously imposed 10% tariff on China to 20%, adding to existing duties on a range of Chinese goods. In response, Beijing announced retaliatory tariffs of up to 15% on key US farm imports, set to take effect on March 10, and imposed export restrictions on 15 US companies, as stated by the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Commerce. Meanwhile, the PBoC has been reinforcing the yuan by consistently setting firmer-than-expected midpoint fixings since mid-November.

However, this capacity may be more vulnerable than those of the higher ratings to adverse business or economic conditions due to any foreseeable event.

2025/3/3 14:59,Рубль начал март снижением на фоне негативной сезонности начала месяца,"МОСКВА, 3 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль котируется в минусе под
занавес торгов понедельника в ожидании развития геополитической
новостной повестки, а против него сейчас выступает сезонное
сокращение продаж экспортной выручки в начале календарного
месяца после уплаты налогов.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 17.45 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 12,21, и российская валюта
теряет 0,8%.
    Доллар к рублю <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 17.45 МСК котировался
по 89,57, и рубль дешевеет на 0,2%.
    Евро к рублю <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 93,90, а
рубль теряет 1,3%.
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> котируется на форексе по 12,14 -
здесь рубль дешевеет на 1,8% от последних показателей LSEG.
    Центробанк с учетом совершавшихся сегодня на российских
биржевом и внебиржевом рынках сделок установил официальные
курсы: 12,17 рубля за юань, 89,25 за доллар и 92,85 за евро
против действовавших 12,08, 88,26 и 91,57 соответственно. 
    Рубль, помимо прямого негативного эффекта от снижения продаж
экспортной выручки, будет более нервно реагировать на возможное
ухудшение новостного геополитического фона при сезонном
отсутствии в ближайшую пару недель ""подушки безопасности"" от
экспортеров, нежели активно отражать позитивную новостную
повестку. 
    Развитие ситуации на геополитическом фронте остается
ключевым драйвером для рубля, и сейчас раздражителем для него
является усилившаяся геополитическая неопределенность после
пятничных переговоров Вашингтона и Киева, которые не привели к
каким-либо договоренностям и ухудшили перспективы быстрого
заключения мирной сделки в украинском конфликте.
    ""В прошедшие выходные нарратив о невозможности скорого
нахождения геополитического компромисса укрепился. Кроме того,
на текущей неделе ослабнет поддержка рубля и со стороны
экспортеров, которые на прошлой неделе завершили уплату
налогов"", - отмечает Денис Попов из Промсвязьбанка.
    Поддержкой же рублю остаются надежды на улучшение отношений
Кремля с новой администрацией Белого дома, которые подпитываются
американскими сигналами о возможных скорых переговорах Дональда
Трампа и Владимира Путина.
    Участники локальных рынков также анализируют возможность
европейского мирного плана прекращения украинского конфликта -
премьер-министр Великобритании Кир Стармер сказал в воскресенье,
что европейские лидеры договорились о разработке такого
соглашения.
    Попов из ПСБ видит пару юань/рубль в диапазоне 12,00-12,50,
предупреждая, что курсовая волатильность может быть повышенной и
останется высоко зависимой от новостного фона.
    Невзирая на негативную динамику под занавес зимы из-за
снижения активности экспортеров по мере накопления ими
достаточного запаса рублевой ликвидности под налоги, а также
ослабления геополитического оптимизма, рубль завершил зиму в
лидерах форекса. 
    Рубль за январь-февраль показал сильнейшее с весны 2022 года
укрепление благодаря ожиданиям деэскалации украинского конфликта
и восстановления отношений между Москвой и Вашингтоном.
    По мнению советника председателя Центробанка Кирилла
Тремасова, укрепление рубля за предыдущие пару недель было во
многом результатом спекулятивной эйфории. 
    ""Мы не знаем, устойчиво это движение или нет"", - признался
он, предположив, что ситуация с рублем уже на текущей неделе
может качнуться в обратную сторону.
    Поддержкой рублю пока остаются ежедневные нетто-продажи
китайской валюты Центробанком РФ в рамках зеркалирования трат из
ФНБ и проведения операций по бюджетному правилу.
    Сейчас регулятор продает юани на 5,6 миллиарда рублей в
день, параметры же свежих интервенций станут известны 5 марта, а
Центробанк начнет проводить их с пятницы.
    ""В целом у курса юаня в ближайшее время есть потенциал
превысить отметку 12,20 рубля, если чистые продажи юаней ЦБР на
март не будут сильно увеличены"", - полагают аналитики банка
Санкт-Петербург.

2025/3/3 9:51,"Юань немного растет, в фокусе - пошлины, заседание ВСНП","ШАНХАЙ, 3 мар (Рейтер) - Китайский юань немного
поднимается по отношению к доллару в понедельник - сильные
индексы активности в промышленном секторе в Китае частично
компенсируют некоторые опасения инвесторов о повышенной торговой
напряженности между Китаем и США, возникшие после того, как
президент США Дональд Трамп предложил ввести дополнительные
пошлины на китайские товары. 
    Спотовый юань на материковом рынке <CNY=> к 11:17 МСК вырос
на 0,13% до 7,2926. На офшорном рынке китайская валюта <CNH=>
укрепилась на 0,14% до 7,3030.
    Дополнительные 10-процентные тарифы Трампа на китайские
товары вступят в силу 4 марта, и власти Китая рассматривают 
соответствующий ответ, сообщило в понедельник государственное
китайское СМИ Global Times.
    Тем не менее, рыночные настроения немного улучшились -
активность в промышленном секторе КНР в феврале выросла самыми
быстрыми темпами за три месяца, показали официальные данные.
    Перед открытием сессии ЦБ Китая объявил срединный
фиксированный курс <CNY=PBOC> на уровне 7,1745 за доллар, самом
слабом с 20 января. При этом значение оказалось на 1.112  pips
(десятитысячных долей процентного пункта) сильнее приведенного
Рейтер прогноза аналитиков <CNY=RTRS> в 7,2857.
    Центробанк объявляет официальный фиксинг сильнее рыночных
прогнозов постоянно, начиная с середины ноября, что аналитики и
трейдеры расценивают как признак беспокойства по поводу
ослабления юаня.
    ""Китайские власти продолжают удерживать стабильный
фиксированный курс ренминби, и мы ожидаем, что это продолжится
на неделе ""Двух заседаний"", - говорится в записке аналитиков
ANZ. Они имеют в виду ежегодное заседание Всекитайского собрания
народных представителей, которое начнется 5 марта.
    ""После этого рынки будут внимательно наблюдать за
фиксингами, чтобы увидеть, начнет ли ЦБ Китая направлять юань в
(сторону) ослабления"".

 (新增评论及收盘报价)
       路透上海/北京3月3日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周一收跌创近三周新低，中
间价创近一个半月新低，和路透预测偏离仍超1,100点，显示外部压力下监管继续释放维稳
信号；市场人士称，美国拟加码对华关税抑制市场风险偏好，人民币承压下挫；但随着全国
“两会”临近，预计汇价走势整体持稳，调整节奏料偏缓。
    
    他们并指出，经历了上一轮中美“贸易战”，此次中国应对料更有章法，市场也在关注
中美高层会谈动向以及中国反制举措；如果情况向不利方向发展，中国也可能出台经济刺激
举措对冲外部冲击影响。
    
    “我们肯定有一些政策储备来应对超预期的关税冲击，比如消费、投资方面可能会出‘
大招’，”一中资行交易员称。
    
    一外资行交易员称，“如果新的关税落地，估计美元/人民币会向7.3靠近，不过中间价
继续横盘的话，即期反弹空间也没多少。”    
  
    
    美国总统特朗普上周威胁要对中国额外征收10%的关税，累计加征关税达到20%，同时指
责中国在阻止芬太尼流入美国方面做得不够，中国称这无异于“讹诈”。
    
    中国媒体环球时报周一报导称，中国正在研究相应对策，以应对将于周二生效的美国新
进口关税，美国的农产品出口很可能成为中国的目标。    
    
    汇丰银行最新点评称，中国全国人大会议将于3月5日召开，预计人民币汇率将保持稳定
；而在美国关税风险下，人民币中间价水平将受到密切关注。
    
    人民币汇率的波动取决于特朗普的关税节奏变化，“若3月关税落地后缺乏改善风险情
绪的利好消息，人民币汇率较当前水平或存在贬值压力，”中金公司外汇团队最新月度展望
称，由于美元偏强、中美利差倒挂形势尚无根本变化，稳汇率政策仍有必要保持一以贯之的
力度。
        
    另外上周五美国公布的1月个人消费支出（PCE）物价指数环比上涨0.3%，同比增长2.5%
，表明通胀正朝着美联储2%的目标迈进，数据也强化了美国经济正在降温的迹象。数据公布
后，市场对美联储将在6月会议上降息25个基点的预期有所上升，根据芝商所的FedWatch To
ol，降息机率为75%，高于前几个交易日的近70%。

2025/3/3 8:20,Рубль показывает смешанную динамику после слабой концовки февраля,"МОСКВА, 3 мар (Рейтер) - Рубль показывает смешанную
динамику на первых весенних торгах после трехдневного снижения
под занавес зимы, при этом в ближайшее время может ощущаться
негативный для российской валюты эффект от сезонного сокращения
продаж экспортной выручки в начале календарного месяца после
уплаты налогов.
    Котировки пары юань/рубль расчетами ""завтра"" к 11.10 МСК
были на Мосбирже вблизи отметки 11,13, и российская валюта
теряет 0,1%.
    Доллар к рублю <RUB=> в системе LSEG к 11.10 МСК котировался
по 89,05, и здесь рубль набирает 0,4% процента.
    Евро к рублю <EURRUB=> котируется на форексе по 92,72, что
близко от пятничного закрытия.
    Пара юань/рубль <CNYRUB=> котируется на форексе по 12,14 -
здесь рубль дешевеет на 1,8% от последних предыдущих показателей
LSEG.
    Раздражителем сейчас выступает усилившаяся геополитическая
неопределенность после пятничных переговоров Вашингтона и Киева,
которые не привели к каким-либо договоренностям и ухудшили
перспективы быстрого заключения мирной сделки в украинском
конфликте.
    Поддержкой же остаются надежды на улучшение отношений Кремля
с новой администрацией Белого дома, вплоть до смягчения
антироссийских санкций США.
    ""В прошедшие выходные нарратив о невозможности скорого
нахождения геополитического компромисса укрепился. Кроме того,
на текущей неделе ослабнет поддержка рубля и со стороны
экспортеров, которые на прошлой неделе завершили уплату
налогов"", - отмечает Денис Попов из Промсвязьбанка.
    В начале текущей неделе он видит пару юань/рубль в диапазоне
12,00-12,50, предупреждая, что курсовая волатильность может быть
повышенной и останется высоко зависимой от новостного фона.
    Рубль начал дешеветь уже с середины прошлой недели, потеряв
за три биржевые сессии более 3,5% в паре с юанем, а на форексе
его потери к доллару за это же время на форексе составили 2,5%.
    Против сыграло снижение активности экспортеров по мере
накопления ими достаточного запаса ликвидности для уплаты
ежемесячных налогов, а также некоторое ослабление
геополитического оптимизма во второй половине прошлой недели.
    Тем не менее, невзирая на негативную динамику под занавес
февраля, рубль завершил его в числе лидеров глобального
валютного рынка: ключевые валюты потеряли против российской
валюты около 10%, падая против нее на многомесячные минимумы.
Юань в прошлую среду дешевел до 11,63 рубля впервые за полгода,
доллар - до 85,37 впервые с начала прошлого августа, евро - до
89,63 впервые за восемь месяцев.
     По мнению советника председателя ЦБР Кирилла Тремасова,
укрепление рубля за предыдущие пару недель было во многом
результатом спекулятивной эйфории. 
    ""Мы не знаем, устойчиво это движение или нет"", - признался
он, предположив, что ситуация с рублем уже на текущей неделе
может качнуться в обратную сторону.
    Рубль за январь-февраль показал сильнейшее с весны 2022 года
укрепление благодаря ожиданиям деэскалации украинского конфликта
и восстановления отношений между Москвой и Вашингтоном при новой
американской администрации.
    Развитие ситуации на геополитическом фронте останется
ключевым драйвером для рубля, при этом при сезонном отсутствии в
ближайшую пару недель ""подушки безопасности"" от экспортеров
российская валюта будет более нервно реагировать на возможное
ухудшение новостного фона, нежели активно отражать позитивную
повестку.
    Поддержкой рублю пока остаются ежедневные нетто-продажи
китайской валюты Центробанком РФ в рамках зеркалирования трат из
ФНБ и проведения операций по бюджетному правилу, что будет
поддерживать курс рубля интрадэй.
    Сейчас регулятор продает юани на 5,6 миллиарда рублей в
день, параметры же свежих интервенций станут известны 5 марта, а
Центробанк начнет проводить их с пятницы.

2025/3/3 7:41,Asia markets mixed despite Wall Street rally and upbeat China's PMI data,"Asia markets mixed despite Wall Street rally and upbeat China's PMI dataAsia-Pacific markets mixed on Monday after stronger-than-expected Chinese PMI data, while investors awaited potential stimulus announcements from this week's National People's Congress in Beijing. Investors also braced for the March 4 deadline of President Donald Trump's latest tariffs. The US is set to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada starting Tuesday, along with an additional 10% duty on Chinese goods.

Traders also kept a close watch on geopolitical developments after Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy failed to reach a deal on Friday that could have helped end the Ukraine war.

Japan (NKY:IND) rose +1.81% to around 37,500, while the broader Topix Index gained 1.1% to 2,711 on Monday, recovering some of last week's losses. The Japanese yen rose to around 150.3 per dollar on Monday, reversing a two-day decline.

On the domestic front, Japan's February manufacturing PMI was revised slightly higher but remained in contraction territory for the sixth consecutive month.

China (SHCOMP) fell 0.06% to surpass 3,330 and the Shenzhen Component up 1.4%, reaching 10,760, and the offshore yuan stabilized around 7.29 per dollar, as investors digested stronger-than-expected PMI data.

Factory activity in the country grew the most in three months, private survey data showed. Meantime, official figures showed the manufacturing sectors unexpectedly expanded while the service economy rose slightly faster than expected.

Investors now await the imminent rollout of US President Trump's additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports this week, coinciding with China's National People's Congress on Wednesday, where stimulus measures and potential countermeasures could be announced.

Hong Kong (HSI) rose +0.38% to 23,313 on Monday morning, reversing losses from the prior two sessions as traders reacted positively to February's PMI readings in China.

India (SENSEX) fell 0.37% to 72,890 in early trade on Monday, lingering at their lowest level since early June 2024.

The HSBC India Manufacturing PMI fell to 56.3 in February 2025, below initial estimates of 57.1 and January's 57.7.

Australia (AS51) rose +0.90% to close at 8,246 on Monday, recovering most of last week's losses. The Australian dollar stabilized above $0.62 on Monday after declining for six consecutive sessions as risk sentiment improved, highlighted by a broad rebound in equities and other risk assets.

On the domestic front, investors responded positively to data showing a 5.9% jump in corporate profits in the fourth quarter, marking the strongest growth in two years. .

Domestically, attention turned to Australia's upcoming economic growth data for the fourth quarter, due on Wednesday, with expectations of modest improvement. Additionally, the minutes from the RBA's February meeting, set for release on Tuesday.

In the U.S., on Friday, all three major indexes ended higher, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq adding 1.6% each, while the Dow rose 601 points.

U.S. stock futures remained volatile on Monday as Wall Street seeks to recover from a tumultuous February: Dow +0.07%; S&P 500 +0.23%; Nasdaq +0.38%.

Looking ahead, traders will also be closely monitoring Friday's monthly jobs report for fresh insights into the health of the labor market. Traders also anticipated December quarter earnings results, following many companies' disappointing earnings reports.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged nearly 10% to around $94,000 on Sunday, hitting a one-week-high, after US President Donald Trump revealed plans to establish a strategic crypto reserve for the country.

    Раздражителем может выступать и геополитическая

    Поддержкой остаются надежды на улучшение отношений Кремля с

потеряла 0,9% при объеме сделок в 105 миллиардов рублей.
    Рубль ожидаемо для большинства участников локального рынка
подешевел на последних февральских торгах с учетом прохождения в
пятницу налоговых выплат, после которых сырьевые корпорации
обычно временно сокращают предложение экспортной выручки.
    В пятницу давление на котировки рубля, помимо снижения
активности экспортеров, оказывали также risk-off под уикенд и
частичная фиксация прибыли в ""длинном"" рубле в последний

2025/3/3 6:26,"China's manufacturing PMI rise to 50.8 in Feb, surpassing expectations","China's manufacturing PMI rise to 50.8 in Feb, surpassing expectationsA private survey showed that China's manufacturing PMI rose to 50.8 in February, up from 50.1 in January, surpassing expectations of 50.3 and reaching a three-month-high, as millions of migrant workers returned after the extended Lunar New Year holiday.

It marked the highest reading since last November, with output and new orders growing the most in three months as market conditions enhanced.

In addition, official data released over the weekend showed unexpected expansion in factory activity, while services sector growth topped forecasts. China's official NBS Manufacturing PMI rose to 50.2 in February 2025 from 49.1 in the prior month, beating market consensus of 49.9 and pointing to the expansion in the factory activity in 3 months.

China's official NBS Non-Manufacturing PMI was at 50.4 in February 2025, up from 50.2 in the previous month and slightly above market consensus of 50.3.

China's NBS Composite PMI Output Index increased to 51.1 in February 2025 from January's five-month low of 50.1 in the previous month.

The Shanghai Composite rising 0.5% to surpass 3,330 and the Shenzhen Component up 1.4%, reaching 10,760, and the offshore yuan stabilized around 7.29 per dollar, as investors digested stronger-than-expected PMI data.

 ((ewen.chew@thomsonreuters.com))"
2025/3/3 4:31,"China's yuan hovers near 2-week low, tariffs, parliament gathering in focus","SHANGHAI, March 3 (Reuters) - China's yuan hovered near
a two-week low against the dollar on Monday as upbeat
manufacturing data partially offset some investor worries over
heightened Sino-U.S. trade tensions after President Donald Trump
proposed extra tariffs on Chinese goods.
    Trump's additional 10% tariffs on Chinese goods will come
into effect on March 4, while China is studying relevant
countermeasures, state-backed Global Times said on Monday.
    Trade tensions had been one of the key drags on the yuan
during Trump's first term as the president, when a series of
tit-for-tat U.S.-China tariff announcements drove the Chinese
currency down more than 12% against the dollar between March
2018 and May 2020.
    However, market sentiment in morning deals was slightly
improved as China's manufacturing activity expanded at the
fastest pace in three months in February, an official factory
survey showed.
    As of 0351 GMT, the onshore yuan <CNY=CFXS> weakened 0.11%
to 7.2881 per dollar, compared with a two-week low of 7.2914 hit
on Friday. 
    Its offshore counterpart <CNH=D3> traded at 7.2965 per
dollar around midday
    Prior to the market opening, the People's Bank of China
(PBOC) set the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan
is allowed to trade in a 2% band, at 7.1745 per dollar, its
weakest level since January 20 but 1,112 pips firmer than a
Reuters' estimate <CNY=RTRS> of 7.2857.
    The central bank has set its official guidance on the firmer
side of market projections since mid-November, which analysts
and traders see as a sign of unease over the yuan's decline.
    ""The Chinese authorities continue to keep the yuan fixings
steady, and we expect them to continue to do so during the week
when the 'Two Sessions' are held,"" analysts at ANZ said in a
note.
    ""After that, markets will be closely watching the fixings to
see if the PBOC starts to guide the yuan weaker.""
    They referred to the annual gathering of China's parliament
starting on March 5, when Beijing is expected to unveil key
economic goals and its policy agenda for this year.
    ""Notably, this new tariff's effective date coincides with
the opening of China's 'Two Sessions', adding to anticipation
around Beijing's policy responses to support growth,"" said Tommy
Xie, head of Asia macro research at OCBC Bank.

2025/3/3 3:30,中国汇市：关税压力上升人民币早盘震荡回落，“两会”在即关注中国后续举措,"*

      美国拟加码关税，人民币面临的外部压力上升
    

        * 
      中国“两会”在即，人民币跌势料受限
    

  

       路透上海3月3日 - 人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>周一早盘略微高开震荡回落，中间价创近一个半月新低，和路透预测偏离仍超1,100点，显示外部压力不减情况下，监管仍继续释放维稳信号；随着中国“两会”临近，即便美元持续偏强，人民币的调整节奏也会相对偏小。
    
    市场人士表示，美国拟加码对华关税确实会增加人民币的贬值压力，市场亦将关注中美高层会否有进一步的会谈以及中国的反制举措，另外中国可能出台进一步的财政举措也会部分缓解外部冲击的影响。
    
    “如果新的关税落地，估计美元/人民币会向7.3靠近，不过中间价继续横盘的话，即期反弹空间也没多少，”一外资行交易员称。
    
    
    招商银行金融市场部表示，短期来看中国“两会”期间预计人民币汇率维持平稳，重点关注央行中间价变化。
    
    马来亚银行最新观点称，若特朗普不断推进强硬贸易政策，美指<.DXY>在短期内有可能进一步反弹至108阻力位，预计中国会宣布更多的支持政策，CNH可能保持横盘整理走势，市场仍期待习特之间任何可能的会谈。

    人民币汇率的波动取决于特朗普的关税节奏变化，“若3月关税落地后缺乏改善风险情绪的利好消息，人民币汇率较当前水平或存在贬值压力，”中金公司外汇团队最新月度展望称，由于美元偏强、中美利差倒挂形势尚无根本变化，稳汇率政策仍有必要保持一以贯之的力度。
    
    此前特朗普提出的对加、墨进口产品征收的关税将于3月4日生效，同时对中国进口产品再加征10%的关税。
        
    市场担心特朗普政府的关税政策将影响经济增长和通胀，投资者纷纷从股票市场转向安全的公债市场，美债收益率跌至数月新低。
    
    另外上周五美国公布的1月个人消费支出（PCE）物价指数环比上涨0.3%，同比增长2.5%，表明通胀正朝着美联储2%的目标迈进，数据也强化了美国经济正在降温的迹象。
    
    数据公布后，市场对美联储将在6月会议上降息25个基点的预期有所上升，根据芝商所的FedWatch Tool，降息机率为75%，高于前几个交易日的近70%。
    
    
    全球汇市方面，欧元兑美元周一从两周半低点反弹，英镑也走高，因欧洲带头重新推动乌克兰和平进程。[FRX/CN]

2025/3/3 1:31,中国汇市：人民币兑美元中间价创近一个半月新低，美国拟加码对华关税推升贬压,"路透上海3月3日 - 人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周一报7.1745元，较上日的7.1738元小跌7点，创1月20日以来新低，和路透预测偏离仍逾1,100点，外部压力有增无减。另外本周中国即将召开“两会”，监管层延续维稳思路，对人民币汇率单边预期进行过滤，避免市场预期出现波动。
    
    人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>上日收盘报7.2838元，夜盘终报7.2798元。离岸人民币即期<CNH=D3>最新报7.289元，上日收盘在7.2957元。稍早前路透测算今日人民币中间价大概会开在7.2857元附近，较上日贬值约1119点，“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。
    

    马来亚银行最新观点称，若特朗普不断推进强硬贸易政策，美指<.DXY>在短期内有可能进一步反弹至108阻力位，预计中国会宣布更多的支持政策，CNH可能保持横盘整理走势，市场仍期待习特之间任何可能的会谈。

    华侨银行则认为，如果新的关税如期生效，人民币可能面临新的压力；当然监管层也会采取应对举措，包括继续通过政策干预来维持稳定。
    
    此前特朗普提出的对加、墨进口产品征收的关税将于3月4日生效，同时对中国进口产品再加征10%的关税。
        
    市场担心特朗普政府的关税政策将影响经济增长和通胀，投资者纷纷从股票市场转向安全的公债市场，美债收益率跌至数月新低，美元<.DXY>维持在107关口上方交投。
    
    另外上周五美国公布的1月个人消费支出（PCE）物价指数环比上涨0.3%，同比增长2.5%，表明通胀正朝着美联储2%的目标迈进，数据也强化了美国经济正在降温的迹象。
    
    
    数据公布后，市场对美联储将在6月会议上降息25个基点的预期有所上升，根据芝商所的FedWatch Tool，降息机率为75%，高于前几个交易日的近70%。

    全球汇市方面，美元指数<.DXY>周一亚洲早盘略微回落，市场将继续关注地缘局势发展、关税动向对汇市的影响。[FRX/CN](完)

    2016年底CFETS进行首次货币篮子规则调整，CFETS篮子货币数量由13种调升为24种，同
时调整了相关货币权重；SDR篮子也调整了货币权重，并与CFETS货币篮子均重新定基，重新
定基日为2016年最后一个交易日。

    2019年底开始交易中心每年年末都对CFETS指数进行权重微调和重新定基，此举旨在进
一步增强指数的代表性。2024年底交易中心将CFETS指数货币篮子和权重都进行调整，篮子
货币总数增至25个。[nL4S3NW0I5]

    2022年底外汇交易中心对SDR指数货币权重进行微调。2019年底对BIS指数货币权重进行
微调；2023年底对BIS指数货币篮子和权重都进行了调整，BIS篮子货币数量调整为43种。（

2025/3/3 0:19,路透测算的人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>今日料开在7.2857元附近,"路透上海3月3日 - 路透根据中国外汇交易中心(CFETS)公布的人民币汇率形成机制测算，人民币兑美元中间价<CNY=PBOC>周一预计会开在7.2857元附近，较上日贬值约1,119点。
    
    上周特朗普与泽连斯基“谈崩”，加上美国公布的消费者支出放缓，美指<.DXY>震荡反弹，美债收益率则下挫至数月低点，而美国继续加征关税的日期越发临近，人民币面临的外部压力不减，监管层或续释放坚定维稳举措，过滤中间价的单边预期。

    上日人民币兑美元即期<CNY=CFXS>收报7.2838元，而中间价则为7.1738元。根据定价机制，今日中间价变动中，有1,100点下跌反映市场供求影响，另有19点下跌反映的是隔夜一篮子汇率基本保持不变所需要的点数；“逆周期因子”暂未发生作用。

    路透测算的上日人民币兑美元中间价为7.2873元，和外汇交易中心公布的实际值偏差1,135点。上日路透根据CFETS公布的中间价测算，人民币汇率CFETS指数、参考SDR（特别提款权）篮子指数和参考BIS(国际清算银行)篮子指数分别为99.9、94.34和106.21。

    上日(截至北京时间次日凌晨3点)人民币兑美元即期累计成交量<CNYSPTVOL=CFXT>为393.93亿美元。

    2016年2月以来中国初步形成“收盘汇率+一篮子货币汇率变化”的人民币对美元汇率中间价形成机制，2017年2月将中间价对一篮子货币的参考时段由24小时调整为15小时，5月底外汇市场自律机制汇率工作组在中间价报价模型中引入“逆周期因子”。

    在2018年初自律机制建议各报价行“可以调整”报价模型中的“逆周期系数”，使其恢复中性；6月起人民币快速下跌，市场贬值预期再起，8月24日自律机制称重启逆周期因子。2020年10月部分报价行将逆周期因子淡出使用。(完)

2025/3/3 0:00,Offshore Yuan Falls as Trade Tensions Rise,"Offshore Yuan Falls as Trade Tensions RiseThe offshore yuan softened to around 7.30 per dollar as investor caution over rising US-China trade tensions overshadowed upbeat PMI data. Market sentiment was dampened by the imminent rollout of Trump’s additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports due March 4, coinciding with China’s National People's Congress on Wednesday, where stimulus measures and potential countermeasures could be announced. Reports suggest China is considering retaliatory tariffs and other measures on US agriculture and food products. Meanwhile, a private survey showed that China’s manufacturing PMI exceeded expectations, rising to a three-month high in February. Additionally, official data released over the weekend indicated an unexpected expansion in factory activity, while services sector growth topped expectations. These figures came as economists warned that fresh US tariffs could pressure manufacturing and exports, prompting firms to rush shipments ahead of potential trade restrictions."
