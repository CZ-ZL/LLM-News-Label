But at a paltry 0.3%, annual imports growth\nslowed too and were a third of expectations.\n    While some banks such as Goldman Sachs have nudged up next\nyear's real GDP forecasts due to the stimulus measures, the\nprice picture raises questions about nominal growth and still\nsuggests the government's 5% growth targets will be hard to hit.\n    And the geopolitics doesn't help much. China's military\nlaunched a new round of war games near Taiwan on Monday, saying\nit was a warning to the \"separatist acts of Taiwan independence\nforces\" - drawing condemnation from the Taipei and U.S.\ngovernments.\n    Taiwan's giant chipmaker TSMC <2330.TW>, the main producer\nof advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications,\nreports earnings on Thursday and is expected to show a 40% leap\nin third-quarter profit thanks to soaring AI-related demand.\n    Oil prices <Clc1> weakened on the latest sweep of Chinese\ndata and policy details, with some of the weekend premium on\nMiddle East concerns dissipating on Monday too. \n    Speculation over how Israel will respond to recent Iranian\nrocket attacks continues to simmer, however, with attention on\nMonday focussing on a U.S. decision to send both U.S. troops and\nanti-missile systems to Israel\n    Even though last week's U.S. inflation numbers ran a bit\nhotter than forecast, the energy price picture remains\nrelatively contained and annual U.S. crude prices have now been\nfalling at a 10%-plus pace for more than six weeks.  \n    In Europe, markets are shaping up this week for the third\nEuropean Central Bank interest rate cut of the year on Thursday.\nEuropean stock <.STOXXE> were flat - warily eyeing both the\nmuddy Chinese picture as trade tensions between Brussels and\nBeijing jar, but also likely further credit easing at home.\n    LVMH <LVMH.PA>, Hermes <HRMS.PA>, Kering <PRTP.PA> and other\nFrench luxury stocks exposed to China fell between 1.4% and 3.6%\non Monday.\n    The euro <EUR=> ebbed slightly into the ECB decision, with\nanother quarter point cut in the official deposit rate to 3.25%\nnow more or less fully priced.\n    French debt markets and risk spreads <FR10DE10=RR> shrugged\noff Friday's decision by Fitch credit ratings firm to lower the\noutlook on France's sovereign rating following the country's\nlatest deficit-cutting budget plan last week.\n    In Britain, Prime Minister Keir Starmer will vow to scrap\nregulation that holds back growth and investment when he hosts\nsome of the world's biggest businesses on Monday at a conference\ndesigned to boost Britain's appeal.\n    Back stateside, a relatively quiet Monday is likely as a\nresult of the semi holiday. The earnings season resumes in\nearnest on Tuesday with updates from Goldman, Bank of America,\nCitigroup, State Street, Johnson & Johnson and others.\n    Politics also gets more intense as the November 5 election\nnears. \n    Although national opinion polls and those in swing states\nstill show little between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican\nDonald Trump, betting markets are making Trump slight favorite\nagain for the first time since July.\n\n    \n    \nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S.\nmarkets later on Monday:\n* Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller and\nMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari speak\n\n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nUS growing at 3%+, with inflation just above target    https://tmsnrt.rs/4052mTY\nU.S. consumer sentiment by party affiliation    https://reut.rs/3ObUtp4\nPredictIt betting market shows Trump back as slight favorite for\nWhite House    https://tmsnrt.rs/3Y6h7Dn\nChina continues to flirt with deflation    https://reut.rs/3YlIwCu\nChinese war games around Taiwan    https://reut.rs/4f65HXf\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (By Mike Dolan, editing by Gareth Jones \nmike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)\n ((mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com  https://reut.rs/3xFdLhlhomsonreuters.com\n mailto:mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com; +44 207 542 8488; Reuters\nMessaging: rm://mike.dolan.reuters.com@thomsonreuters.net/))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "EUR/USD Extends Recovery But Don't Expect It To Last - Here's WhyNov 26, 2024\n\nImage Source: Pixabay  \n\nThe euro rebounded after an initial drop, as Trump made no immediate tariff threats against eurozone exports. While his warnings appear to be negotiation tactics ahead of his January 20 inauguration, markets remain highly reactive to headlines, creating volatile trading conditions. Despite appointing Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary, Trump’s potential use of executive orders underscores his direct leadership style. The brief cooling of the \"Trump Trade,\" characterised by a strong dollar and Bitcoin rally, may not last. For now, the euro is gaining short-term relief, though the EUR/USD forecast remains modestly bearish.  \n\nOutlook far from ideal for euro\n\nOvernight we saw a big shake up in the FX space as currencies of Mexico, Canada, and China all came under pressure. Only one man could cause such a stir, and it was no other than President-elect Donald Trump, who threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada unless they step up border security against illegal immigration, and to curb Fentanyl inflows from China. Relieved that there were no immediate mentions against eurozone exports, the euro managed to bounce back after a quick drop. While this move appears to be a negotiation tactic from Trump ahead of his January 20 inauguration, the market will increasingly become headline-driven and make for tricky trading conditions. Still, despite appointing a perceived safe pair of hands in Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary, one should not take lightly Trump’s verbal warnings as he could use executive orders to pass them through law. Indeed, if you recall from my note on Monday, I warned that Trump will be the ultimate boss and will lead from the front. And overnight he did really remind us who the boss was. Therefore, the slight cooling of the so-called \"Trump Trade,\" i.e., with a strong dollar cooling as we have seen thus far in the week (except against CAD and CNH that were hit by Trump’s tariff threat overnight), may not last long. But today, the euro is finding itself on the front foot amid the relief bounce that commenced from end of last week from severely technical oversold levels. While the recovery may end up lasting for a while, the EUR/USD outlook remains modestly bearish.  \n\nEuro rebound could be short-lived \n\nThis week, we haven’t got much in the way of Eurozone date. On Monday, the German Ifo Business Climate survey offered new insights into business sentiment. Following last week’s weak PMI data, a positive surprise seemed unlikely, and the results confirmed this. The survey came in at 85.7, below both the previous 86.5 and expectations of 86.1.\n\nThe euro’s recent struggles underscore investor concerns about the economic outlook in the Eurozone and China, as well as trade uncertainties in 2025 following Trump’s US election victory.\n\nTraders are closely monitoring eurozone data for improvement, but without positive signs, the euro may remain under pressure despite a strong start to the week. Last week’s composite PMI fell from 50 to 48.1, indicating contraction, with both services and manufacturing slowing. Weak export demand and declining business sentiment add to the gloom. While third-quarter GDP showed growth, fourth-quarter stagnation now appears likely, reinforcing a bearish euro sentiment.  \n\nWhat about US dollar and data? \n\nWhile it may have lost some momentum, the dollar has been on a strong bullish trend until the start of this week. But it is by no means it is the end of the bullish trend. Traders have been betting on Trump’s fiscal policies, including sweeping trade tariffs and measures to boost economic growth. The dollar index had risen for eight straight weeks through Friday. The momentum is thus quite strong and so this dollar weakness may prove to be short-lived, preventing the EUR/USD from turning bullish just yet.\n\nThis is a shortened week due to Thanksgiving. Today’s data highlights on the US economic calendar include CB Consumer Confidence (expected to show an improvement to 111.8 from 108.7 last), New Home Sales, Richmond Manufacturing Index and FOMC minutes. On Wednesday, ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, the US will release a flurry of data, including the second estimate of Q3 GDP, core PCE inflation, unemployment claims and durable goods orders.\n\nThese reports could significantly influence the short-term EUR/USD direction, but it may not have any long-term impact as everyone is focused on what Trump will mean for the dollar next year. With many investors likely stepping away for the long holiday weekend, Friday could be a quieter day.    \n\nEUR/USD technical analysis and key levels to watch\n\nSource: TradingView.com\n\nThe fact that the EUR/USD has so far refused to hold below last year’s low of 1.0448 is a modestly positive sign, if it can hang around these levels. But the series of lower lows and lower highs should remind you that we that we have seen such recovery attempts only to be engulfed frequently by even sharper sell-off periods. Thus, without a solid technical evidence that rates have bottomed out, we could be in another such environment: corrective phase inside a larger bear trend. The EUR/USD is therefore far from bullish from a purely technical point of view, just yet.\n\nIf the EUR/USD manages to build a base now around the 1.0450-1.0500 area (shaded in grey on the chart), then we may see it climb back towards the next resistance at 1.0600, and even higher towards the more significant hurdle around 1.0700 area. But if it goes back below that 1.0450-1.0500 area, then for me that would be the clearest indication yet that traders want to see even lower levels such as 1.0300, 1.0200 and so on.\n\nMore By This Author:\n\nGold Drops On Bessent Appointment But Bears Face Lots Of Hurdles S&P 500 At Pivotal Zone EUR/USD Under Pressure From Multiple Sources But Clings On To $1.05 For Now"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

One Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial stock can currently be bought for about CNY 4.16 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial stocks is 1.2 bn. Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial has a current market capitalization of CNY 5 bn and approximately CNY 61.6 mn worth of Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Shandong Bohui Paper Industrial has traded -2.43 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 5.27. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 7.17 on 10/31/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 3.61 on 09/18/2024.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Shaanxi Heimao Coking (601015.SS) traded up 3.94 % and now trades at CNY 2.96. Current market capitalisation for Shaanxi Heimao Coking is CNY 5.9 bn.\n\n- Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion (603583.SS) traded up 3.99 % and now trades at CNY 16.02. Current market capitalisation for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is CNY 5.9 bn. Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion has a current price to earnings ratio of 18.89. Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Fujian Apex Software (603383.SS) traded up 10 % and now trades at CNY 29.41. Fujian Apex Software has a market capitalisation of CNY 5.9 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Fujian Apex Software is 27. Title: Fujian Apex Software's Strong Fundamentals Drive Growth Potential Investors looking for a promising investment opportunity may want to consider Fujian Apex Software Co Ltd (FAS), a software development company based in China. Despite the lack of recent news, the company's strong fundamentals suggest that it could be poised for growth in the long term. According to data from Finanzen.net, the last known news about FAS dates back to August 29th, when the company presented its quarterly results. As of September 11th, the stock has maintained a steady closing price of 25.51 CNH, with a 52-week high of 55 CNH reached on September 26th, 2023, and a 52-week low of 23.25 CNH recorded on August 28th, 2024. These figures indicate a relatively stable performance over the past year, with a slight upward trend. One key metric that stands out for FAS is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 24.49, which suggests that the market is undervaluing the company's earning potential. This is supported by the company's strong financial health, with a Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 4, indicating that the company's assets are worth significantly more than its current market value. While there have been no recent developments or announcements regarding FAS, the company's solid track record and strong financials make it an attractive investment option for those seeking long-term growth. With a history of stability and a promising future ahead, FAS could be a valuable addition to any portfolio.\n\n- Zhejiang Lante Optics (688127.SS) traded up 6.07 % and now trades at CNY 15.44.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Outlook for yuan assets stable amid global volatility: analystsAs global markets encountered tremendous volatility in recent days, Chinese markets remained relatively stable, with the yuan strengthening against the US dollar, and the outlook for yuan-denominated assets remains bright, Chinese analysts said on Tuesday.Amid concerns over a potential recession in the US economy, China's economy is expected to rebound steadily despite downward pressure, as more policy measures will likely offer strong support, which in turn will further improve the attractiveness of yuan-denominated assets for global investors, analysts noted. Following a widespread sell-off on Monday, Asian stocks bounced back on Tuesday. Japan's main stock index, the Nikkei, gained more than 10 percent, rebounding sharply from a record loss of 12.4 percent on Monday. In South Korea, the Kospi rose 3.5 percent on Tuesday, following an 8.8 percent drop on Monday.On the Chinese mainland, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.23 percent on Tuesday, while the smaller Shenzhen Component Index gained 0.82 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index was down 0.31 percent on Tuesday.Notably, the yuan saw remarkable gains in recent days. On Monday, the onshore yuan reached a seven-month high of 7.1120 against the US dollar, while the offshore yuan reached a high of 7.0636, according to Reuters. While the yuan eased somewhat on Tuesday, it remained relatively strong, with the central parity rate strengthening 27 pips to 7.1318 against the US dollar, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.Compared with record losses and gains overseas, Chinese markets remained relatively stable and will likely attract more global investors, analysts noted.Cheng Shi, chief economist of ICBC International, said that Chinese stocks have been under pressure amid some capital outflows, but as overseas markets undergo corrections, some global capital will likely return. \"We are cautiously optimistic about A-share stocks and Hong Kong stocks,\" Cheng told the Global Times, noting that recent top policy meetings in China have emphasized achieving the annual growth targets, and various policy measures will offer support for Chinese stocks. \"It is expected that more supportive policies will be rolled out, which will help form a policy-catalyzed market trend.\" Analysts also said that as Chinese policymakers are expected to continue to support the economic recovery, the yuan's exchange rate will remain overall stable, despite fluctuations by other major currencies, and yuan-denominated assets could become safe havens for global capital. \"As recent top meetings stressed the need to stabilize economic growth, more policy measures will offer further support for the yuan's strengthening,\" Yang Delong, chief economist at Shenzhen-based First Seafront Fund, told the Global Times on Tuesday, noting that yuan-denominated assets will likely become more popular among global investors.A meeting of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee on July 30, which focused on economic work for the second half of 2024, stressed the need to determinedly accomplish the economic and social development targets for the year, and pointed out that the implementation of macro policies should continue to be strengthened. Specifically, the meeting noted that the emphasis should be placed on boosting consumption to expand domestic demand.China has set a GDP growth target of about 5 percent for 2024, and many economists said that the country is on track to achieve the target, despite growing external downward pressure. China's steady economic recovery, compared with recessionary worries about the US economy, will also offer strong support for the yuan's exchange rate and the attractiveness of yuan-denominated assets, analysts said. \"On the one hand, as the likelihood of the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates grows, the attractiveness of the dollar will weaken, which in turn will ease the external depreciation pressure on the yuan. \"On the other hand, China's economy achieved a year-on-year growth rate of 5 percent in the first half of 2024, showing that China's economy still maintains stable growth momentum despite global uncertainties, providing support for the yuan's exchange rate,\" Cheng said.\n\nCopyright Global Times.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "April 17 (Reuters) - Price action in FX derivatives is consistent with a\ngrowing risk of increased volatility and deeper EUR/USD declines, but low cost\noptions are still available for holders to participate should the situation\narise. \n    Implied volatility is a realised volatility gauge and key component of an\noption premium, so it's no surprise to see it surge to new long-term highs, with\nan additional premium for EUR/USD downside strikes. However, these higher\npremiums can be advantageous for more exotic type options.  \n    A regular vanilla call option with a strike at 1.0600 and expiry in 1-month\nwould cost 60 USD pips, or 33 USD pips with the strike at 1.05 and 17 USD pips\nwith the strike at 1.0400 (break-even is the strike minus the premium). However,\nthe additional implied volatility premium for downside strikes will cheapen\noptions with a knock-out trigger below the strike as that trigger is deemed more\nlikely to be touched and kill the option.  \n    For example, a 1-month expiry 1.0600 USD call with a knock out trigger at\n1.0300 is half the price of its vanilla equivalent, albeit dead if 1.0300\ntrades. Longer expiries and triggers closer to strike/current spot will be even\ncheaper.   \n    Alternatively, vanilla EUR put/USD call spreads allow holders to sell\nEUR/USD at one strike providing they buy at another below it. They are similar\nto KO-trigger options in that they are cheaper and profit potential is limited\nto the lower strike, but remain in play until expiry.\n   \n          \n    For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n1-3-month expiry EUR/USD risk reversals    https://tmsnrt.rs/3Q4oF6q\n1-month EUR/USD FXO implied vs 1-month daily realised volatility    https://tmsnrt.rs/3xB3Ysp\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Skshu Paint is trading -0.21 percent lower with a volume of CNH 128.4 mn on Monday 23rd of SeptemberSep 23, 2024\n\nSkshu Paint (603737.SS) traded down -0.21 % during a 24 hours period ending at 10:23 AM Central Europe on Monday 23rd. One Skshu Paint stock can currently be bought for about CNH 29.33 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Skshu Paint stocks is 527 mn. Skshu Paint has a current market capitalization of CNH 15.3 bn and approximately CNH 128.4 mn worth of Skshu Paint was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Skshu Paint has traded 6.61 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 37.81. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 71.3 on 09/26/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 26.3 on 08/29/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Skshu Paint\n\nSkshu Paint Co Ltd: Technical Analysis Investors looking for a value play may want to take a closer look at Skshu Paint Co Ltd (SKSHU), a paint manufacturer that has seen its stock experience significant fluctuations over the past year. As of September 17th, the stock closed at 26.87 CNH, down from its 52-week high of 73.2 CNH reached on September 20th, 2023. Despite the decline, SKSHU's fundamentals remain strong, with a Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) of 223.72 and a Price to Book Ratio (P/B) of 5.66. These ratios suggest that the stock may be undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. Looking back at the company's historical performance, SKSHU has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the past year. After reaching its 52-week high in September 2023, the stock saw a sharp correction, falling to a low of 26.3 CNH on August 28th, 2024. However, the stock has since recovered some of these losses, driven by improving financial results and positive industry trends. From a technical perspective, SKSHU's chart pattern suggests that the stock may be poised for further upside. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 48.67, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for potential growth. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is showing a bullish crossover, suggesting that the upward momentum may continue in the near term. Overall, investors who are willing to take on some risk may find SKSHU an attractive opportunity for long-term gains. However, it is important to keep a close eye on the company's financial performance and any developments in the broader market before making a decision.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Gemdale (600383.SS) traded up 1.24 % and now trades at CNH 4.01. Gemdale has a market capitalisation of CNH 18.2 bn. Gemdale Corp: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Investors looking to gain a foothold in the Chinese real estate market may want to take a closer look at Gemdale Corp (GEMD.CN), whose shares have been trading within a tight range over the past few months. Despite lacking any recent news, a technical analysis of the asset provides some interesting insights. As of September 20th, the last closing price of Gemdale was 4.03 CNH, down from its 52-week high of 7.14 CNH reached on September 24th, 2023. However, the stock has struggled to break above its previous resistance level, currently hovering around 4.20 CNH. This could be an indication that the upward momentum has slowed, at least in the short term. On the other hand, Gemdale's 52-week low of 2.89 CNH, hit on July 28th, 2024, suggests that the stock has experienced significant support at this level. Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 46.67, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, which could be seen as a neutral signal for potential investors. Another important metric to consider is the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) of -3.97, which indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. Furthermore, the price-to-book ratio of 0.25707 suggests that the stock is reasonably priced based on its assets. In conclusion, while there appears to be limited news driving Gemdale's share price recently, a technical analysis reveals a mixed picture. While the stock has struggled to break above its previous resistance level, it has also shown significant support at its 52-week low. Potential investors may want to keep a close eye on the stock's movement in the coming days and weeks to determine whether it will continue to trade within this range or break out to new heights.\n\n- Cofco Sugar (600737.SS) traded up 1.76 % and now trades at CNH 8.69.

The shortfall amounted to 6.4% of gross\ndomestic product, up from 6.2% a year earlier.\n    A fiscal think-tank, the Committee for a Responsible Federal\nBudget, recently estimated that Republican Donald Trump's plans\nwould pile up $7.5 trillion in new debt, more than twice the\n$3.5 trillion envisaged in Democrat Kamala Harris's proposals.\n    Shifting odds on post-election Congressional math, however,\nmay have much to do with how any of those fiscal plans pan out. \n    At 4.12%, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields <US10YT=RR> hovered\nclose to 2-1/2 month highs on Monday even with another\nquarter-point Federal Reserve interest rate cut still near fully\npriced for next month.\n    With the Atlanta Fed's real-rime \"GDPNow\" model indicating\ngrowth in excess of 3.4% and U.S. economic surprise index at its\nmost positive in six months, the early Q3 earnings season is\nimpressing again with 83% of the 71 S&P500 firms reported \nbeating forecasts.\n    While the blended annual profit growth estimate for the 500\nhas dipped to 4% from the 5% expected pre-season, according to\nLSEG data, revenue growth is holding to expectations and a\nreturn to brisk double-digit earnings expansions is still\nforecast for next quarter and right through next year.\n    A heavy diary of updates this week spans industrial,\ndefence, energy and financial sectors but Tesla's quarterly\n<TSLA.O> likely grabs many headlines mid-week.\n    Overseas, attention was back on China on Monday as the\nlatest official lending rate cuts there were mostly expected and\nmet with a shrug by markets. The one-year loan prime rate\n<CNYLPR1Y=CFXS> was lowered by 25 basis points to 3.10% from\n3.35%, while the five-year LPR <CNYLPR5Y=CFXS> was cut by the\nsame margin to 3.6% from 3.85% previously.\n    Even though Chinese GDP and industrial data released on\nFriday were marginally ahead of forecasts, the historic slowdown\nremains in train and the property bust continues. China's new\nhome prices fell at the fastest pace since May, 2015. \n    China's mainland shares <.CSI300> eked out a small gain on\nMonday, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng <.HSI> lost more than 1%.

SWIFT is a global provider of financial messaging services. \n\n China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is the largest market for offshore yuan transactions, taking up 76.18 percent, followed by the UK at 6.16 percent and Singapore at 3.76 percent, the report said. \n\n The data shows that the yuan is becoming increasingly popular as more countries are willing to use the Chinese currency in cross-border trade settlement, conduct cross-border investment and financing, and sign currency swap deals with China, Xi Junyang, a professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Thursday. \n\n With solid efforts to promote yuan's internationalization in recent years, China has seen a strengthened role of the yuan across the board, from international payment and settlement, investment and financing, and reserves to pricing. \n\n As of the end of August, the People's Bank of China (PBC), the country's central bank, signed bilateral currency swap agreements with 42 foreign central banks or monetary authorities. A total of 29 bilateral currency swap agreements are in force, with a total scale of about 4.1 trillion yuan ($561.72 billion), the Xinhua News Agency reported, citing a PBC report. \n\n The PBC stressed at a meeting on Monday that the central bank will steadily boost financial reform and high-level opening-up next. It said efforts will be made to promote the internationalization of the yuan in a careful and robust manner, further enhance its functions as an international currency for cross-border payments, investment and financing, reserves and other functions. Meanwhile, the central bank will strengthen the competitiveness of the yuan cross-border payment system. \n\n The internationalization of the yuan is an important part of China's financial opening-up. Looking ahead, efforts are needed in several aspects to boost the yuan's internationalization, Xi said. He said the country should continue to expand opening-up, strengthen connect programs with other markets, and facilitate convenience in cross-border investment and fund-raising. \n\n As an increasingly international currency, the yuan is able to maintain a stable exchange rate in the future thanks to multiple favorable factors, including the central government's supportive macroeconomic policies that have improved market expectations, sustained economic recovery and foreign exchange market resilience. \n\n\nCopyright Global Times.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Daily Market Outlook - Wednesday, Nov. 6Nov 06, 2024\n\nImage Source: Pixabay  \n\nThe results of the US presidential election indicate that Trump will emerge victorious and the Republican Party will maintain control of the Senate. The New York Times' closely-watched 'swingometer' projected a 93% chance of Trump winning, while Treasury yields rose to four-month highs as some betting sites significantly favoured him. However, the House of Representatives is still too close to call. Four years after departing the White House, Trump has advanced to the brink of a remarkable political revival by defeating Democrat Kamala Harris in the battleground states of North Carolina, Georgia & Pennsylvania. The euro, yen, and antipodean currencies have experienced declines as a result of the 1.5% increase in the US dollar index, which is the largest increase since March 2020. The dollar's sharp increase against the offshore yuan prompted reports that Chinese banks were selling dollars to slow the yuan's decline. China is perceived as being at the forefront of tariff risk, and its currency is currently trading at a high level of uncertainty, with implied volatility against the dollar circling record highs. As investors anticipate a meeting of top policymakers in Beijing this week to sanction local government debt refinancing and spending, Chinese markets have declined from an almost one-month high.\n\nEuropean stock futures were less ebullient due to the potential for a global trade war and the threat to EU exports if Trump's tariff policies are implemented. Additionally, there was a possibility that Trump could disengage from NATO, which would necessitate an increase in defence expenditures in Europe and would also serve to strengthen Russia's territorial ambitions. Aside from US political developments, macro events that could potentially impact markets on Wednesday include: Services within the Eurozone Producer prices for September and PMIs for October. September industrial orders in Germany. Services provided by the United States PMI for October.  \n\nOvernight Newswire Updates of Note\n\n * Trump Wins The Critical Battleground State Of Pennsylvania \n * PBoC Affirms Supportive Monetary Policy\n * Japan PM Ishiba Preps Meeting With Biden, China’s XI\n * Japan PMI, Confidence Shrinks On Softer Sales\n * UBS Pushes Back RBA First Rate Cut Forecast To May 2025\n * NZ Unemployment Rate Rises Less Than Forecast\n * Hong Kong Stocks Slide, Traders Pare Risky Bets\n * US Stock, Yields Rise As Markets Await Election Outcome\n * Nvidia Rides AI Wave Past Apple As World largest Company\n * Crypto Surge To Record Levels On Early Trump Lead\n * Spike In UK Borrowing Cost Wipes Out Fiscal Headroom\n *           (Sourced from reliable financial news outlets)\n\n \n\nFX Options Expiries For 10am New York Cut \n\n(1BLN+ represents larger expiries, more magnetic when trading within daily ATR)\n\n * EUR/USD: 1.0650 (3.9BLN), 1.0700 (686M), 1.0725 (1.5BLN)\n * 1.0750 (900M) 1.0800 (2.4BLN)\n * USD/CHF: 0.8675 (241M), 0.8700 (1.4BLN), 0.8800 (289M)\n * EUR/GBP: 0.8390-0.8400 (621M)\n * GBP/USD: 1.3000 (331M)\n * AUD/USD: 0.6475 (689M), 0.6510 (728M), 0.6525 (817M)\n * AUD/NZD: 1.1010 (397M), 1.1100 (300M)\n * USD/CAD: 1.3800 (555M), 1.3875 (420M), 1.4025 (267M), 1.4050 (442M)\n * USD/JPY: 153.50 (728M), 155.65 (350M)  \n\nCFTC Data As Of 1/11/24\n\n * Net USD G10 long +$8.88bn to +$18.7bn in Oct 23-29 IMM period; $IDX +0.13%\n * EUR +0.17%: speculative positions decreased by 21.8k contracts, now at -50.3k, lower ECB view weighs on EUR\n * JPY +1.55%; speculative positions decreased by 37.6k contracts, now at +25k, on hawkish Fed, less dovish BoJ\n * GBP +0.27%; speculative positions decreased by 8.2k contracts, now at +66.4k; less-dovish BoE lends support.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech trades -3.72 percent lower on Thursday 19th of SeptemberSep 19, 2024\n\nShanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech (688372.SS) traded down -3.72 % during a 24 hours period ending at 11:28 AM Central Europe on Thursday 19th. One Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech stock can currently be bought for about CNY 36.32 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech stocks is 113.8 mn. Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech has a current market capitalization of CNY 4.5 bn and approximately CNY 25.4 mn worth of Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech has traded -12.76 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 53.69. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 118.42 on 09/25/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 33.97 on 07/18/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Shanghai V-test Semiconductor Tech\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: Shanghai V-Test Semiconductor Tech's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into Shanghai V-Test Semiconductor Tech (SVTS) may be scratching their heads after the latest quarterly results and fluctuating stock performance. Despite the lack of recent news, we can analyze the company's historical data to identify trends and patterns that might influence future growth. Priced at 37.08 CNY as of yesterday's close, SVTS has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the past year, with its 52-week high reaching 118.42 CNY on September 24th, 2023, and dipping to a low of 33.97 CNY on July 17th, 2024. This significant volatility suggests that investors have been uncertain about the company's long-term prospects. Looking at the company's Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, we find that it stands at an elevated 51.8819, indicating that investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of earnings. However, this could also suggest that the market expects strong future growth, which would justify the higher valuation. On the other hand, the Price to Book (P/B) ratio of 1.89442 indicates that investors are paying approximately twice the value of the company's book assets. While this could indicate undervaluation, it's essential to consider other factors before making any conclusions. SVTS's mixed signals continue when examining its chart pattern. After peaking in late September 2023, the stock experienced a sharp correction, falling by nearly 70% to reach its lowest point in mid-July 2024. Since then, the stock has recovered slightly but remains below its previous highs. This choppy price action suggests that investors are still trying to determine the company's true worth. To summarize, while there haven't been any recent developments regarding Shanghai V-Test Semiconductor Tech, our technical analysis reveals a complex picture of mixed signals. Investors must carefully evaluate the company's historical performance, financial ratios, and chart patterns to make informed decisions about whether to buy or sell SVTS shares.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Fujian Apex Software (603383.SS) traded up 0.52 % and now trades at CNH 25.97. Current market capitalisation for Fujian Apex Software is CNH 5.3 bn. Fujian Apex Software has a current price to earnings ratio of 24.04. Title: Fujian Apex Software's Strong Fundamentals Drive Growth Potential Investors looking for a promising investment opportunity may want to consider Fujian Apex Software Co Ltd (FAS), a software development company based in China. Despite the lack of recent news, the company's strong fundamentals suggest that it could be poised for growth in the long term. According to data from Finanzen.net, the last known news about FAS dates back to August 29th, when the company presented its quarterly results. As of September 11th, the stock has maintained a steady closing price of 25.51 CNH, with a 52-week high of 55 CNH reached on September 26th, 2023, and a 52-week low of 23.25 CNH recorded on August 28th, 2024. These figures indicate a relatively stable performance over the past year, with a slight upward trend. One key metric that stands out for FAS is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 24.49, which suggests that the market is undervaluing the company's earning potential. This is supported by the company's strong financial health, with a Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 4, indicating that the company's assets are worth significantly more than its current market value. While there have been no recent developments or announcements regarding FAS, the company's solid track record and strong financials make it an attractive investment option for those seeking long-term growth. With a history of stability and a promising future ahead, FAS could be a valuable addition to any portfolio.\n\n- Citic Niya Wine (600084.SS) traded down -2.95 % and now trades at CNH 4.79.

The core PCE deflator is a preferred inflation gauge in the US for\nthe FOMC. Our CBA colleagues estimate a strong 0.3% lift in February both due\nto shelter and healthcare costs.\n\nAuthor:                       chris.tennent-brown@asb.co.nz\n\nASB Economics | 649 301 5657 |\n\nPlease refer to the important disclosures at the end of this document\n\n25 March 2024\n\n Currencies                 Currencies                                         Commodities                      Equities                \n NZD/USD     0.5992  0.0%   NZD/SEK                6.356   0.3%                NZX WMP           3050.0  0.8%   Dow       39476  -0.8%  \n NZD/AUD     0.9184  -0.2%  NZD/DKK                4.136   0.0%                Gold $/o          2165.4  -0.7%  S&P 500   5234   -0.1%  \n NZD/EUR     0.5558  0.2%   NZD/THB                21.8    2.5%                WTI Oil $/b       81.0    -0.6%  NASDAQ    16429  0.2%   \n NZD/JPY     90.97   0.3%   AUD/USD                0.6524  0.2%                Money Market (%)          FTSE   7931      0.6%   \n NZD/GBP     0.4777  0.4%   EUR/USD                1.081   0.0%                90 Day BB         5.64    0.00   CAC-40    8152   -0.3%  \n NZD/CAD     0.8153  0.0%   USD/JPY                151.4   0.0%                OCR               5.50    0.00   DAX       18206  0.1%   \n NZD/CHF     0.5378  -0.1%  10 Yr Bond Yields (%)          ASB Swap Rates (%)                    H.Seng  16499  -2.2%     \n NZD/HKD     4.687   0.0%   NZ                     4.54    0.01                1yr               5.34    -0.01  Nikkei    40888  0.2%   \n NZD/SGD     0.8082  -0.1%  US                     4.20    -0.07               2yr               4.84    -0.01  ASX200    7771   -0.1%  \n                                                                                                                                        \n NZD/CNH     4.360   0.0%   Aust                   4.04    -0.06               5yr               4.32    -0.02  NZX50     11979  -      \n\n ASB Economics & Research                                                      Phone           Fax             \n Chief Economist           Nick Tuffley         nick.tuffley@asb.co.nz         (649) 301 5659  (649) 302 0992  \n Senior Economist          Mark Smith           mark.smith4@asb.co.nz          (649) 301 5657                  \n Senior Economist, Wealth  Chris Tennent-Brown  chris.tennent-brown@asb.co.nz  (649) 301 5853                  \n Senior Economist          Kim Mundy            kim.mundy@asb.co.nz                                            \n Economist                 Nat Keall            nathaniel.keall@asb.co.nz      (649) 301 5915                  \n Future Me Graduate        Jordan Campbell      Jordan.campbell@asb.co.nz                                      \n Administration Manager    Caro Phillips        caro.phillips@asb.co.nz                                        \n\nhttps://reports.asb.co.nz/index.html                    ASB Economics\n\nASB North Wharf, 12 Jellicoe Street, Auckland\n\nImportant Disclaimer\n\nThis document is published solely for informational purposes.

One Cnh Industrial stock can currently be bought for about USD 11.16 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Cnh Industrial stocks is 1.3 bn. Cnh Industrial has a current market capitalization of USD 14.1 bn and approximately USD 138.7 mn worth of Cnh Industrial was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Cnh Industrial has traded 0.81 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at USD 11.14. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at USD 13.3 on 04/10/2024. 52 weeks low was at USD 9.28 on 08/05/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Cnh Industrial\n\nCNH Industrial Shares Stable Despite Lack of Recent News Despite the absence of recent news, shares of CNH Industrial (CNHI) have remained stable, trading within a tight range over the past few days. As of yesterday's closing bell, the stock closed at $11.26, just a hair below its 52-week high of $13.30 reached on April 9th. A closer look at the company's technical indicators reveals that the stock has been trending upwards since hitting a 52-week low of $9.28 on August 4th. This uptrend has been driven by improving fundamentals, including a strong price-to-earnings ratio of 7.26 and a price-to-book ratio of 1.86287. While there have been no recent developments regarding the company, investors may be taking comfort in the fact that CNHI has consistently delivered positive quarterly results. In its most recent quarterly report, the company posted a net income of $1.2 billion, beating analyst estimates by $140 million. From a technical standpoint, the stock appears to be well-supported by both short-term and long-term moving averages. The relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 62.67, indicating that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. In conclusion, while there have been no recent news updates on CNH Industrial, the stock's stability and consistent performance may be attractive to investors seeking a solid long-term holding. However, it is important to keep an eye on any potential developments that could impact the company's future prospects.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Bunzl (BNZL.L) traded up 0.64 % and now trades at GBP 3,440. Bunzl has a market capitalisation of GBP 11.4 bn. Bunzl has a current price to earnings ratio of 23.56. Bunzl plc (OTCMKTS:BZLFF), a leading distributor and services company, has seen a significant increase in short interest in October, with a growth of 14.7% compared to the previous month. According to the latest data, there were 46,900 shares of short interest as of October 15th, up from 40,900 shares in September. This represents a days-to-cover ratio of 156.3 days, indicating that it would take approximately 156 days to cover the current level of short interest. Additionally, the stock has been performing well, with a 50-day moving average price of $45.42 and a 200-day moving average price of $40.92. The stock has a 52-week low of $35.44 and a 52-week high of $47.53. Insiders have been buying the stock, with purchases totaling £1.3 million over the past year. Separately, a recent article by Finanzen.net highlighted how much investors could have earned if they had invested in Bunzl one year ago. With a starting price of £28.94 per share, an investment of £1,000 one year ago would now be worth £34,554, representing a gain of 21.35%. The market value of Bunzl currently stands at £11.56 billion.\n\n- Legal & General (LGEN.L) traded down -0.27 % and now trades at GBP 220.5. Legal & General has a market capitalisation of GBP 12.9 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Legal & General is 47.02. Legal & General Group PLC Sees No Recent News, Technical Analysis Reveals Stability Investors looking for stability in their portfolios may find solace in Legal & General Group PLC (OTCMKTS: LGGNY), which has seen little recent news activity. According to data from American Banking News, the last known news update was published on October 28th, with the stock's last closing price standing at 220 GBP. This lack of new developments suggests that the company's fundamentals remain strong, boding well for long-term investors. Looking back at the stock's historical performance, Legal & General reached its 52-week high of 259 GBP on January 30th, before retreating slightly to its 52-week low of 211.4 GBP on August 4th. Despite this fluctuation, the stock has maintained a consistent upward trend, with its current price sitting just below its 52-week high. From a technical standpoint, Legal & General's Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) stands at 47.02, indicating that the stock is currently overvalued compared to its peers. However, its Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 3.25141 suggests that the stock is reasonably priced based on its financial health. These ratios indicate that while the stock may be expensive in terms of earnings, it remains undervalued when considering its assets and liabilities. Overall, the lack of recent news and stable historical performance suggest that Legal & General Group PLC is a reliable investment option for those seeking long-term growth potential. While the stock may be overvalued based on its P/E Ratio, its P/B Ratio indicates that it remains reasonably priced given its financial health. As such, investors may consider adding Legal & General to their watchlists or portfolios for steady returns in the months ahead.\n\n- Rentokil Initial (RTO.L) traded down -1.28 % and now trades at GBP 395.9. Rentokil Initial has a market capitalisation of GBP 9.8 bn. Rentokil Initial has a current price to earnings ratio of 24.91. Pomerantz LLP, a leading law firm specializing in corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation, has announced that they are investigating potential securities fraud claims against Rentokil Initial plc (RTO) on behalf of investors. This follows the company's recent announcement of weaker than expected sales in North America, which led to a significant decline in the company's stock price. Specifically, Rentokil disclosed that it expects full-year adjusted pretax profit of approximately £700 million, down from £766 million in the previous year, and plans to cut an undisclosed number of jobs in its US workforce to address cost overruns. As a result, the company's American Depositary Receipt (ADR) price fell by 21.04% to close at $24.95 per ADR on September 11, 2024. Pomerantz LLP is urging investors who have suffered losses to contact them to discuss their legal options.\n\n- Airlines (IAG.MC) traded down -0.24 % and now trades at GBP 214.8. Current market capitalisation for Airlines is GBP 12.6 bn. Airlines has a current price to earnings ratio of 5.02. Investing in International Consolidated Airlines (LSE: ICL) three years ago would have been a profitable move for investors. According to recent data, an initial investment of £100 would now be worth £125.52, representing a 25.52% increase in value. This growth is attributed to the company's current market capitalization of £10.45 billion and its share price of £2.13 as of November 1st, 2024. The calculation excludes dividends and stock splits, highlighting the potential gains for those who invested in the airline company's shares back in 2021.\n\n- Pentair (PNR) traded up 1.2 % and now trades at USD 101.39. Current market capitalisation for Pentair is USD 16.3 bn. Pentair has a current price to earnings ratio of 24.5. Investing in Pentair's stock three years ago would have yielded significant profits, with a return of over 34% on original investments. According to recent market data, the value of Pentair's shares has risen from $74.31 per share three years ago to $16.28 billion in current market capitalization. This growth is attributed to the company's strong performance and steady increase in share price over time. For investors who invested $10,000 in Pentair's stock three years ago, their portfolios would now be worth approximately $134,571, with a total return of $34,100.40 in profit.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Cnh Industrial\n\nCNH Industrial NV is a multinational company headquartered in London, United Kingdom.

Current market capitalisation for Kpc is CNY 11.9 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Kpc is 26.55. Headline: Technical Analysis: KPC Pharmaceuticals Inc (KPC) Shows Promising Growth Potential Investors may be keeping a close eye on KPC Pharmaceuticals Inc (KPC), as the stock has been exhibiting strong growth potential despite the lack of recent news. According to sources, the last known news regarding KPC dates back to January 23rd, 2024, with a headline that reads \"昆药集团：KPC-149口服溶液临床试验申请获受理\" (KPC-149 Oral Solution Clinical Trial Application Approved). However, this news has had little impact on the stock's performance, suggesting that investor sentiment remains positive. Looking at the charts, KPC has been trending upwards over the past year, with a 52-week high of 24.11 CNH on May 5th, 2024, and a 52-week low of 11.92 CNH on September 17th, 2024. This indicates that the stock has experienced significant growth over the past year, with a gain of approximately 21% between its highest and lowest points. Additionally, the stock's current price of 15.75 CNH represents a discount of around 30% compared to its 52-week high. From a technical standpoint, KPC appears to be trading within a well-established uptrend, with support levels at 11.92 CNH and resistance levels at 24.11 CNH. This suggests that the stock may continue to experience upward momentum in the near future, particularly if it can break through its resistance level and reach new heights. Furthermore, the stock's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 26.59 and price-to-book ratio (P/B) of 2.16 indicate that it may be undervalued relative to its peers, providing an attractive entry point for investors looking to capitalize on its growth potential. Overall, while there may be limited news surrounding KPC at present, the stock's strong historical performance and promising technical outlook suggest that it could be a compelling addition to any portfolio.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "SHANGHAI, Sept 18 (Reuters) - China's yuan held steady\nagainst the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, as traders returned to\nwork after the Mid-Autumn Festival break and ahead of the\nFederal Reserve's key rate decision.\n    The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which\nconcludes later on Wednesday, is expected to kick off a U.S.\neasing cycle that could spark volatility in currency pairs,\nincluding dollar-yuan.\n    The chances of a super-sized cut of 50 basis points (bps)\nretreated to 65% in the morning session in Asia, according to\nLSEG data, after U.S. retail sales unexpectedly rose in August.\n    A broader decline in the dollar in anticipation of U.S. rate\ncuts in coming months has buffeted the yuan over the past few\nweeks. The currency has recovered its earlier losses and is 0.1%\nfirmer this year.\n    \"Should the Fed disappoint markets and signal a gradual,\ncalibrated pace of rate cuts, there may well be a knee-jerk\nrebound in the USD as short-end rates reprice higher,\" said\nChang Wei Liang, FX and credit strategist at DBS.\n    \"There is likely to be significant intraday market\nvolatility tonight when the FOMC decision is announced along\nwith the latest dot-plots,\" said Alvin Tan, head of Asia FX\nstrategy at RBC Capital Markets.\n    Trading in China's onshore currency resumed on Wednesday\nafter the domestic market was closed on Monday and Tuesday.\n    Prior to the market's opening, the People's Bank of China\n(PBOC) set the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>, around which the yuan\nis allowed to trade in a 2% band, at 7.0870 per dollar, its\nstrongest since Jan. 2 and 42 pips weaker than a Reuters'\nestimate.\n    The spot yuan <CNY=CFXS> opened at 7.0968 per dollar and was\nlast trading 14 pips lower than the previous late session close\nat 7.0972 as of 0250 GMT and 0.14% weaker than the midpoint.\n    The offshore yuan traded at 7.0992 yuan per dollar <CNH=>,\nup about 0.17% in Asian trade.\n    The dollar's index <=USD> against six major currencies was\n0.079% lower at 100.83.\n    China's central bank said it injected 568.2 billion yuan\n($80.11 billion) through seven-day reverse repos in open market\noperations on Wednesday and that it would conduct the\nmedium-term lending facility (MLF) loans rollover on Sept. 25.\n    Investors expect China to keep its policy accommodative,\nwith the potential to ease further at its monthly loan prime\nrate (LPR) fixing on Friday and possible cuts to its reserve\nrequirement ratio (RRR). \n    New bank lending in China jumped less than expected in\nAugust after hitting a 15-year low in July, as the central bank\npledged to roll out more supportive measures to bolster a\nfragile economic recovery.\n    \n    LEVELS AT 0250 GMT \n INSTR  CURREN  UP/DOW  %       DAY'S   DAY'S \n UMENT  T vs    N(-)    CHANGE  HIGH    LOW\n        USD     VS.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Nov 21 (Reuters) - Bets on the yuan depreciating aren't getting much\ntraction anymore, as China's central bank welds a tight lid on USD/CNY using the\ndaily midpoint that determines its daily trading bandwidth.\n    For more than a week, the People's Bank of China has been applying a\ncounter-cyclical adjustment factor to the USD/CNY fixing, keeping it under the\npsychological benchmark of 7.2000. The upper limit for spot has hence been\nhovering just below 7.3500. \n    The fixing's deviation from neutral forecasts has recently increased to\ncounter the U.S. dollar's near-relentless rise, suggesting the PBOC is using\ndynamic damping to fend off yuan bears. Thursday's fix showed a deviation of\naround -550 pips from approximately -300 pips last Wednesday.\n    The strategy appears to be barely working, with USD/CNY and USD/CNH still\nelevated near four-month highs; dollar longs are in no rush to capitulate\ndespite the strong signal of authorities' intolerance for further yuan weakness.\n    Along with other Asian FX authorities, most notably Japan's, the PBOC has\nits work cut out, as markets continue to price in the worst-case scenarios of\nthe incoming Trump administration implementing inflationary economic policies.\n    For now, the uncertainty caused by Trump's historic election victory has\nmade market instability a prime concern for Asian market authorities. Until more\nclarity as to the extent of Trump carrying out his tariff threats, don't expect\nChina to free the yuan up.    \n    \nFor more click on [FXBUZ] \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nCNYband:     https://tmsnrt.rs/3Z1N8x3\nCNY:     https://tmsnrt.rs/3AQyKQ1\nCNYfix:     https://tmsnrt.rs/4eEtD3h\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Ewen Chew is a Reuters market analyst.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "(Adds quote, recasts)\n       Oct 8 (Reuters) - A sharp rally in China shares at\nTuesday's open lost steam as a hotly anticipated briefing by the\ncountry's state planner failed to sustain optimism for further\nstimulus.\n    Mainland markets soared to more than two-year highs on their\nreturn from a week-long holiday, with the blue-chip CSI300\n<.CSI300> and the Shanghai Composite <.SSEC> each rising more\nthan 10%.\n    However the momentum waned once National Development and\nReform Commission (NDRC) Chairman Zheng Shanjie spoke,\nannouncing $28 billion in support for local governments. \n    He also pledged to quicken fiscal spending, and expressed\nfull confidence in achieving this year's economic growth and\ndevelopment targets.\n    Before entering the Golden Week holiday, Chinese stocks had\nalready been on a tear, with Beijing announcing the most\naggressive stimulus measures since the pandemic.\n    \nCOMMENTS:\nSHAUN LIM, FX STRATEGIST, MAYBANK, SINGAPORE\n\"China's NDRC has largely disappointed with no new stimulus\nmeasures announced. Rally looks to fizzle out today given the\nNDRC disappointment, but fundamental valuations for Chinese\nassets remain attractive. Look to see if further measures will\nbe announced later.\"\n    \nKEN CHEUNG, FX STRATEGIST, MIZUHO, HONG KONG\n\"The FX impact from the NDRC press conference disappointment was\nlargely muted, as the CNH and CNY trading was relatively stable\namid the stock market frenzy. \n    \"However, the risks to CNH are skewed to the downside due to\ncooling China market optimism and the recent USD rally. We noted\nthat the PBoC's massive easing and the positive signals from the\nPolitburo meeting have tempered bearish China growth\nexpectations, outweighing the negative impact from the US-China\ninterest rate spread widening after the PBoC's rate cut. \n    \"An underwhelming stimulus package could swiftly dampen\nbullish sentiment, giving way to the PBoC's rate cut\nmaterialising to weigh on the RMB exchange rate.\"\n    \nSEAN TEO, SALES TRADER, SAXO, SINGAPORE\n\"I believe there was significant pent-up demand for Chinese\nstocks, as evidenced by citizens lining up to open new accounts.\nHowever, while these market movements can be exciting, they are\noften not sustainable. The CSI 300 has surged approximately 38%\nover the past six days. Typically, returns on Chinese markets\naverage around 10%, so we've exceeded that by nearly four times.\n    \"The returns between Hong Kong and Chinese stocks remain\nlargely parallel, although Hong Kong is underperforming today.\nThis underperformance may be due to some investors reallocating\ntheir funds from Hong Kong to Chinese markets, where government\nstimulus is more direct. The Chinese government has a strong\ncapacity to mobilize resources, and if executed correctly, this\ncould lead to Chinese markets outperforming those of other\ncountries.\"\n    \nRONG REN GOH, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, EASTSPRING INVESTMENTS,\nSINGAPORE\n\"Markets were hoping to obtain some guidance on the size of\nfiscal stimulus at this presser – but with MoF not in\nattendance, it was unlikely this information was going to be\nprovided. Recall market estimates on stimulus ranged between CNY\n2 trillion – 10 trillion. A number closer to 10 was needed to\nsustain the risk rally.\n    \"NDRC Chairman recapped key announcements and pledges with\nno new information – disappointing the markets.\n    \"What's next? No major press briefing lined up so far. Thus,\nit is likely we see markets consolidating and digesting what has\nalready been announced, which arguably is meaningful, but not\nquite enough to satiate lofty expectations.\"\n    \nMATT SIMPSON, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, CITY INDEX, BRISBANE\n\"We're seeing a shakeout at the highs of a very strong rally.\nBut when we reach the point of a rally where my neck hurts by\nlooking at it, you could argue a pullback is overdue.\n    \"Either way, it seems some are booking profits after\nexceptional gains over gold week, and this could deter others\nfrom simply stepping in to support the market immediately. And\nthat paves the way for some chop around the top, if not a deeper\npullback for China's markets.\"\n    \nROB CARNELL, ING'S REGIONAL HEAD OF RESEARCH FOR ASIA-PACIFIC,\nSINGAPORE\n\"I think there's a lot of expectations for some further meat on\nthe bones of the physical stimulus that's been talked about a\nbit recently... talk about consumption vouchers, perhaps more\ninfrastructure spending investment.\"\n\nVASU MENON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, INVESTMENT STRATEGY, OCBC,\nSINGAPORE\n\"The strong showing today is not a big surprise as the Chinese\nbourses are probably playing catch-up after both the Hang Seng\nTech Index in Hong Kong and the Golden Dragon Index in the U.S.\nsurged by over 10% in the first week of October when Chinese\nmarkets were closed for the Golden Week holidays. \n    \"There are no clear signs that the Chinese economy is on the\nmend yet, so this rally is largely sentiment-driven and sparked\nby Beijing's stimulus blitz in late September. \n    \"Ultimately for the rally to be sustainable, we need to see\nmore fiscal policy and more measures to support the economy and\nthe property market. A great deal of hope has been built into\nthe strong rally in recent weeks and we now need to see\nadditional government policy action to support the uptrend.\"\n    \nGARY NG, SENIOR ECONOMIST, NATIXIS, HONG KONG\n\"I think the movement today basically explains that in the\nChinese onshore market, it's just rising to a level that\ninvestors are comfortable with.\n    \"Because no one is really certain about what is going on in\nthe stimulus... there could be a bit of uncertainties about\nwhether it is above or below market expectations.\"\n        \nJUN RONG YEAP, MARKET STRATEGIST, IG, SINGAPORE\n\"Mainland China stocks are largely playing catch-up, after being\nout for the Golden Week holiday over the past week. Optimism\naround recent stimulus efforts remains at play.\"\n    \nCHRISTOPHER WONG, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, OCBC, SINGAPORE \n\"So far, the NDRC press conference appears to run short on\ndetails with regards to stimulus measures. Hopes were raised but\nthe delivery was disappointing. Post-opening rally in Chinese\nequities has fizzled out and the lack of follow-through is a\nsetback to sentiments.\"\n\n (Reporting by Tom Westbrook, Rae Wee, Ankur Banerjee and\nArchishma Iyer; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)\n ((vidya.ranganathan@thomsonreuters.com; +65-69738261;\nwww.linkedin.com/in/vidya-))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

The central bank unveiled a series of initiatives, including a 50 bps cut in reserve requirement ratios, a 20 bps reduction in the seven-day reverse repo rate, and a 30 bps decrease in the medium-term lending facility rate. Additionally, benchmark loan prime rates are expected to be lowered by 20-25 bps following their hold at the September fixing. The PBOC also anticipates lowering existing mortgage rates by about 50 bps, potentially reducing household interest payments by around CN¥ 150 billion. Furthermore, down-payment requirements for second homes will be cut to 15%, aligning them with those for first-home purchases. Overall, these measures underscore Beijing's commitment to achieving a 5% GDP target for 2024, creating a challenging environment for yuan bears."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

Furthermore, you also have to see what the Chinese authorities would have to say.\n\n[geotargetedbrokercarousel]\n\n * The US dollar has initially tried to rally a bit during the course of the trading session on Friday as we continue to see a lot of noisy behavior in this market.\n * That being said though, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of volatility and it is probably worth noting that the moving average just above the 50 day EMA is going to cause quite a bit of resistance.\n * Beyond that we have the 7.1250 level that I think comes into the picture as a bit of a ceiling as well.\n\nOn the Break Higher...\n\nIf the US dollar were to break above there, we would probably have a major risk off type of event going on as this pair tends to rise with concerns about the global economy and fall with liquidity measures and more of a risk on attitude. If we fall from here, the market could very well drop down to the 7.05 level, possibly even down to the 7.0 level.\n\nI do expect to see a lot of support in that area, so it'll be interesting to see how this plays out, because clearly the People's Bank of China does not want to see the Chinese Yuan strengthen too much. As a general rule, they like the idea of staying above the seven level in this currency pair, so that'll be interesting to see. The technical analysis is most certainly negative in this pair at the moment, so I would anticipate that selling pressure probably comes into the picture sooner rather than later. This doesn't necessarily mean that the US dollar gets eviscerated everywhere, because remember, the Chinese yuan is a strange and unique animal in and of itself.\n\nReady to trade our Forex daily analysis and predictions?

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "SHANGHAI, September 20 (SMM) -\n\nCopper\n\nLME copper opened at $9,543.5/mt overnight. After a slight initial fluctuation, it peaked at $9,572.5/mt and then declined to a low of $9,477/mt. It later rebounded slightly and closed at $9,539/mt, up 1.48%. The trading volume was 28,000 lots, and open interest was 271,000 lots. The most-traded SHFE copper 2410 contract opened at 75,910 yuan/mt, peaked at 76,000 yuan/mt initially, then declined to a low of 75,430 yuan/mt, and finally consolidated to close at 75,660 yuan/mt, up 1.03%. The trading volume was 36,000 lots, and open interest was 136,000 lots. Macro-wise, following the long-anticipated US Fed rate cut, the US dollar index declined. Additionally, data released by the US Department of Labor on Thursday showed that initial jobless claims unexpectedly recorded 219,000 last week, the lowest since the week of May 18, 2024, reducing recession expectations and boosting copper prices. On the fundamentals, after the most-traded contract shifted to 2410, downstream restocking enthusiasm was high, with overall demand relatively strong. However, supply was tight in some regions, causing downstream concerns about future arrivals. As of Thursday, September 19, SMM copper inventory in major regions stood at 192,600 mt, down 24,300 mt WoW, marking the 11th consecutive week of destocking, with destocking accelerating. The inventory hit a new post-Chinese New Year low. Overall, copper prices are expected to fluctuate at highs today.\n\nAluminum\n\nFutures market: The most-traded SHFE aluminum 2411 contract opened at 20,105 yuan/mt overnight, reaching a high of 20,135 yuan/mt and a low of 20,040 yuan/mt, and closed at 20,080 yuan/mt, up 120 yuan/mt or 0.6%. Yesterday, LME aluminum opened at $2,521.5/mt, hit a high of $2,569/mt and a low of $2,506/mt, and closed at $2,540/mt, up $18/mt or 0.71%.\n\nSummary: On the macro front, the US Fed's rate cut was implemented as expected, with the cut slightly exceeding market expectations, causing overseas metals to jump initially and then pull back. Domestically, the market is widely focused on the new round of LPR adjustments, with macro sentiment improving and benefiting the metals market. Fundamentals side, domestic aluminum market supply slightly increased, supported by the September-October peak season, with downstream consumption remaining positive. Aluminum social inventory entered a destocking cycle, showing good performance in the supply-demand balance for aluminum in September and October. Additionally, disruptions in the alumina supply and tight spot supply continued to support alumina prices to fluctuate upward, providing some drive from the cost side for aluminum. Overall, with the short-term favourable macro atmosphere and solid fundamentals, the aluminum market is expected to fluctuate upward in the short term.\n\nLead\n\nOvernight, LME lead opened at $2,032.5/mt, briefly touched a low of $2,022/mt during the Asian session, and then rebounded. Due to a weaker US dollar index, shorts reduced their positions during the European session, causing LME lead to fluctuate upward, reaching a high of $2,090.5/mt, and finally closing at $2,082.5/mt, up 2.49%.\n\nOvernight, the most-traded SHFE lead 2410 contract opened at 16,610 yuan/mt, briefly touched a low of 16,560 yuan/mt at the beginning of the session, and then rebounded, boosted by LME lead, reaching a high of 16,705 yuan/mt. It then fluctuated around 16,660 yuan/mt and closed at 16,675 yuan/mt, up 1.65%.\n\nMacro-wise, the initial jobless claims in the US for the week ending September 14 recorded 219,000, the lowest since the week ending May 18, 2024. The offshore yuan rose to around 7.06 against the US dollar.\n\nOn the spot fundamentals, the first working day after the Mid-Autumn Festival saw the delivery of the SHFE lead 2409 contract. Due to the delivery factors of holders, the arrival of lead ingots in social warehouses increased during the holiday, pushing the overall inventory level to a one-month high. Meanwhile, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, many lead smelters continued production as usual, while downstream enterprises generally took 1-2 days off, leading to a temporary lack of lead consumption and a continuous rise in lead ingot inventory. Additionally, the recent simultaneous decline in supply and demand for lead ingots resulted in a sluggish spot market. For the future trend of lead prices, attention should be paid to the extent of downstream stocking before the National Day holiday.\n\nZinc\n\nOvernight, LME zinc opened at $2,880/mt. At the beginning of the session, short positions increased, pushing LME zinc down to $2,848/mt. Subsequently, long positions entered at the lows, driving LME zinc to fluctuate upward, with the focus shifting to around $2,930/mt during European trading hours. During this period, it reached a high of $2,945/mt. Entering the night session, LME zinc briefly fell but was supported by the daily moving average. By the end of the session, the focus returned to around $2,930/mt, and it finally closed at $2,939.5/mt, an increase of $55.5/mt or 1.92%. Trading volume decreased to 11,574 lots, and open interest increased by 978 lots to 243,000 lots. Overnight, LME zinc recorded a large bullish candlestick, with the 10/20-day moving averages providing support. Overnight, LME inventory increased by 4,950 mt to 256,800 mt, an increase of 1.97%. LME inventory continued to rise. The US Fed's rate cut overnight led to a broad rise in non-ferrous metals, with LME zinc fluctuating at highs.\n\nOvernight, the most-traded SHFE zinc 2411 contract opened at 24,100 yuan/mt. At the beginning of the session, short positions increased, pushing SHFE zinc down along the daily moving average, with the focus shifting to 23,890 yuan/mt. Subsequently, long positions entered and short positions closed, pushing SHFE zinc back to the daily moving average. It finally closed at 23,925 yuan/mt, an increase of 150 yuan/mt or 0.63%. Trading volume decreased to 45,221 lots, and open interest increased by 648 lots to 95,752 lots. Overnight, SHFE zinc recorded a bearish candlestick with no upper shadow, with various moving averages providing support. Overnight, driven by the overseas market, SHFE zinc fluctuated at highs. Coupled with positive domestic policy expectations, market sentiment improved. However, the current price has reached a resistance level, and further upward movement requires additional stimulus.\n\nTin\n\nIn the night session yesterday, the most-traded SHFE tin contract closed at 259,080 yuan/mt, up 2,930 yuan/mt, an increase of 1.14%. The highest price was 260,280 yuan/mt, and the lowest was 257,900 yuan/mt.\n\nDuring the morning session yesterday, trading companies' quotes for various domestic tin ingot brands showed little change compared to recent days. Small brand tin ingots were quoted at premiums of 0-500 yuan/mt against SHFE 2410 contract, delivery brand tin ingots were quoted at premiums of 200-700 yuan/mt against SHFE 2410 contract, and Yunnan Tin brand was quoted at premiums of 200-800 yuan/mt against SHFE 2410 contract. Imported tin brands were quoted at discounts of 700-200 yuan/mt against SHFE 2410 contract. The sharp rise in tin prices during the morning session yesterday dampened the purchasing enthusiasm of downstream and end-user companies, with only a few downstream companies restocking as needed. Most trading companies saw scattered transactions. Overall, the spot market transactions were relatively sluggish yesterday.\n\nNickel\n\nOn September 19, Jinchuan nickel was quoted at a premium of 1,800-2,000 yuan/mt, with an average of 1,900 yuan/mt, up 50 yuan/mt compared to the previous trading day. Norilsk nickel was quoted at a discount of 200-100 yuan/mt, with an average of 150 yuan/mt, up 25 yuan/mt compared to the previous trading day. On the morning of September 18, the futures market fluctuated upward, and the spot premium narrowed overall compared to the previous working day. The price of nickel briquette was 121,850-122,950 yuan/mt, up 375 yuan/mt compared to the previous trading day. The price spread between nickel briquette and nickel sulphate was about 4,509 yuan/mt (nickel sulphate prices were 4,509 yuan/mt higher than nickel briquette prices)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

The CNH also pointed out that the total resources that could be incorporated in the base scenario are 8.8 million barrels of crude oil equivalent, while adding those of the incremental scenario could reach 42.6 million barrels.The commissioning president, Agustín Díaz Lastra, said that what is approved is an extension of time for PEP to do the work and in due course the details of the corresponding drilling will be seen.Pemex in Tabasco:#ConocePemex en #1minuto With these activities, in the Cheek field we are increasing approximately one thousand barrels more than what we had committed to.

Any disparity between implied\nand realised volatility over the life of that option can therefore create a\ntrading opportunity. Historic volatility is past realised volatility and can\nprovide a fair value measure for implied volatility.\n    The most recent bout of FX realised volatility lifted historic volatility\nand fuelled a spike higher in implied volatility. But, while implied volatility\nhas quickly reverted toward prior long term lows, historic volatility remains\nelevated and is now almost equal to, or even above (in the case of AUD/USD)\nimplied volatility, when looking at the benchmark 1-month expiry.\n    There is less risk of deeper declines and subsequent losses for holders of\noptions/implied volatility from current low levels, while 1-month historic\nvolatility shows that a repeat performance of the past month's FX realised\nvolatility would cover the current 1-month expiry implied volatility premium.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Dec 20 (Reuters) - USD/JPY gains were bolstered by this week's hawkish\nU.S. Federal Reserve and dovish Bank of Japan policy announcements, before\nFriday's Japanese verbal intervention spurred setback. However, USD/JPY looks\nset to continue its rise, albeit at a more cautious pace, which might suit a\nlower cost option designed for such a scenario. \n    JPY put/USD calls give holders the right to buy USD/JPY at a pre-set level\n(strike) and time (maturity) and only risk an up-front premium. If USD/JPY spot\nis above the strike at maturity, the holder can execute the option and bank the\ndifference between the strike and current spot rate (minus the premium). \n    However, if the extent of USD/JPY gains is expected to be limited, so is the\nprofit potential. Therefore the JPY put/USD call option buyer might consider\nselling a higher strike to help offset the initial cost, although the profit\npotential is then limited to the difference between the 2 strikes (minus the\npremium). \n    To benefit from a much bigger premium discount to the regular vanilla JPY\nput/USD call option, the holder might consider adding a knock-out trigger above\ntheir perceived USD/JPY target. For example, with USD/JPY spot at 156.75, a\n1-month expiry 157.00 strike JPY put USD call costs 150 JPY pips and therefore\nhas a break-even of 158.50. Profit is unlimited above this level. But adding a\n160.00 knock-out trigger reduces the initial premium to just 8 JPY pips - a\nbreak-even of 157.08, although the option is dead if 160.00 trades before\nexpiry. \n    Longer dated maturities and/or placing triggers closer to the strikes can\nfurther reduce premiums and vice versa.  \n       \n      \n    For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nJPY=EBS    https://tmsnrt.rs/3ZOgm2M\nUSD/JPY rko option price    https://tmsnrt.rs/4gMPoQ2\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Ke (BEKE) is trading 1.94 percent higher on Thursday 7th of November and has a trading volume of USD 91.4 mnNov 06, 2024\n\nKe (BEKE) traded up 1.94 % during a 24 hours period ending at 03:39 AM Central Europe on Thursday 7th. One Ke stock can currently be bought for about USD 59.75 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Ke stocks is 1.2 bn. Ke has a current market capitalization of USD 26.8 bn and approximately USD 91.4 mn worth of Ke was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Ke has traded -6.96 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at USD 15.77. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at USD 26.04 on 10/04/2024. 52 weeks low was at USD 12.44 on 03/08/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Ke\n\nTitle: KE Holdings Inc. Stock Soars on Analyst Upgrade; Is the Upswing Sustainable? In a recent development, KE Holdings Inc. (KE) has been upgraded to \"Buy\" by Bank of America (BofA), with analysts citing the company's position as a beneficiary of China's stimulus package. This move has sent the stock soaring, with shares currently trading at $22.09, just shy of their 52-week high of $26.045. From a technical standpoint, KE's recent upswing appears to be gaining momentum. The stock has broken above its previous resistance level of $21.50, indicating that buyers are becoming more aggressive in their bids. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently sitting at 64.26, which suggests that the stock may still have room to run before reaching overbought territory. However, it's worth noting that KE's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 43.51 is significantly higher than the industry average of 24.64. This could indicate that investors are anticipating strong future growth, but it also means that the stock may be more sensitive to any disappointment in earnings. Furthermore, the stock's price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 2.69502 is lower than the industry average of 3.47, suggesting that investors may be undervaluing the company's assets. Conclusion: While the upgrade from BofA certainly provides a boost to KE's prospects, investors should exercise caution when considering an investment in the company. While the stock's technical indicators suggest that it may continue to rise in the short term, the high P/E ratio and relatively low P/B ratio warrant careful evaluation before making a decision. As always, it's important to conduct thorough research and consider multiple perspectives before making an investment.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Anta Sports Products (2020.HK) traded up 3.91 % and now trades at HKD 88.5. Anta Sports Products has a market capitalisation of HKD 238.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Anta Sports Products is 17. In recent trading days, the stock price of Anta Sports Products has experienced significant volatility. On October 30th, the stock fell by 4.04% to close at 10,03 euros per share, marking a decline from its previous closing price. This drop follows a positive trend seen earlier in the week, when the stock reached a high of 10,532 euros on October 28th, representing a gain of 3.32%. Despite this fluctuation, investors remain optimistic about the company's performance and continue to buy shares. The current market capitalization of Anta Sports Products stands at approximately 10 billion euros.\n\n- Sf (002352.SZ) traded up 0.26 % and now trades at CNY 44.4. Sf has a market capitalisation of CNY 220.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Sf is 23.13. SF Holding Co Ltd Eyes Second Listing in Hong Kong; Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals In an effort to expand its reach and raise capital, Chinese courier giant SF Express has set its sights on a second listing in Hong Kong, with plans to go public on November 27th, according to a report by Bloomberg. This move comes as the company seeks to tap into the city's deep pool of investors and take advantage of its status as a global financial hub. From a technical standpoint, the stock has exhibited mixed signals over the past year, with fluctuations in both the price and volume. The last closing price of 44.21 CNY represents a decrease of -5.1% compared to the 52-week high of 49.38 CNY reached on October 7th, 2024. However, this decline has been partially offset by a gain of +14.6% since the 52-week low of 32.93 CNY hit on February 4th, 2024. Looking at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, SF Holding Co Ltd currently trades at a premium, with a multiple of 21.66 times earnings. This is slightly above the industry average, indicating that investors have priced in expectations of strong future growth. Meanwhile, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio stands at 2.3548, suggesting that the market values the company's assets at a discount relative to its peers. Despite these positive indicators, some analysts remain cautious due to concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the logistics sector. However, with vaccination rates increasing globally and economies gradually reopening, there may be opportunities for companies like SF Express to benefit from the recovery. In conclusion, while the near-term outlook for SF Holding Co Ltd remains uncertain, the company's expansion plans and solid fundamentals suggest that it could be a compelling long-term investment opportunity for risk-tolerant investors. As always, it is important to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Seres (601127.SS) traded up 10 % and now trades at CNY 132. Seres has a market capitalisation of CNY 207.6 bn. Seres has a current price to earnings ratio of 53.64. Title: SERES Group Co Ltd: Technical Analysis Reveals Upswing Potential Investors may be eyeing SERES Group Co Ltd (SEHK:2408) with renewed interest, given the company's recent expansion into European markets and strong historical performance. As of September 11th, 2024, the stock closed at 75.91 CNH, just shy of its 52-week high of 106.66 CNH reached on March 17th, 2024. This marks a significant recovery from the 52-week low of 41.6 CNH seen on September 13th, 2023. A closer look at the company's financial ratios paints an even more promising picture. With a Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 224.26, investors can expect substantial growth potential compared to industry peers. Additionally, the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) stands at 8.76, indicating undervaluation based on the company's net assets. These figures suggest that SERES may be poised for long-term success and potentially offer attractive entry points for savvy investors. While there have been no recent news updates on the company, the successful launch of their new energy vehicle product, SERES 5, in Europe bodes well for future sales and revenue growth. Furthermore, the first batch of user deliveries took place on June 21st, 2023, in Norway, highlighting the company's commitment to expanding its global presence. Given these positive developments and the company's solid financials, it may be worth considering SERES Group Co Ltd as a viable investment opportunity. However, as with any investment decision, it is essential to conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor before making any moves.\n\n- Nari (600406.SS) traded up 1.35 % and now trades at CNY 27.19. Nari has a market capitalisation of CNY 213.5 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Nari is 28.49.\n\n- Ping An Bank (000001.SZ) traded up 1.66 % and now trades at CNY 11.64. Current market capitalisation for Ping An Bank is CNY 225.9 bn. Ping An Bank has a current price to earnings ratio of 5.17. Title: Technical Analysis: Ping An Bank's Price Plunge Raises Eyebrows In a surprising move, the share price of Ping An Bank Co Ltd (HKG:2318) has plummeted over the past few months, raising concerns among investors. As of November 6th, 2024, the stock closed at 11.65 CNY, marking a significant drop from its 52-week high of 13.43 CNY recorded on October 7th, 2024. This downward trend has prompted analysts to reassess the company's financial health and outlook. A quick glance at the price chart reveals that the stock has been experiencing a steady decline since peaking in mid-October. This downtrend has been accompanied by a decrease in trading volume, which could indicate a lack of interest from buyers. However, it's worth noting that the stock still maintains a respectable liquidity level, with an average daily trading volume of approximately 2.5 million shares. One possible reason behind Ping An Bank's price drop could be the recent lowering of interest rates for deposits, as reported by aastocks.com on July 26th, 2024. This move may have dampened investor enthusiasm, as it could potentially reduce the bank's profitability. Nevertheless, the decision to lower interest rates could also be seen as a proactive measure to support the economy during these challenging times. From a valuation standpoint, Ping An Bank's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 5.17, representing a discount compared to its historical averages. Additionally, the stock's price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 0.471418 suggests that it is undervalued based on its assets. These metrics might appeal to value investors seeking bargains in the financial sector. However, it's important to note that the company's financial performance has been mixed recently. While net profits for the first half of 2024 increased by 12% year-over-year, the second quarter saw a slight dip in earnings due to higher provisions for loan losses. Moreover, the bank's return on equity (ROE) has been steadily decreasing since the beginning of the year, which could be a cause for concern among investors. Taking everything into account, the current situation with Ping An Bank presents a complex picture. On one hand, the stock's attractive valuations and solid financials could make it an appealing choice for value investors. On the other hand, the recent price drop and mixed financial performance might warrant caution before jumping into the stock. As such, investors should carefully weigh the pros and cons before making any investment decisions regarding Ping An Bank.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Ke\n\nKE Holdings Inc. is an integrated online and offline platform for housing transactions and services operating in China.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Daily Market Outlook - Wednesday, Nov. 6Nov 06, 2024\n\nImage Source: Pixabay  \n\nThe results of the US presidential election indicate that Trump will emerge victorious and the Republican Party will maintain control of the Senate. The New York Times' closely-watched 'swingometer' projected a 93% chance of Trump winning, while Treasury yields rose to four-month highs as some betting sites significantly favoured him. However, the House of Representatives is still too close to call. Four years after departing the White House, Trump has advanced to the brink of a remarkable political revival by defeating Democrat Kamala Harris in the battleground states of North Carolina, Georgia & Pennsylvania. The euro, yen, and antipodean currencies have experienced declines as a result of the 1.5% increase in the US dollar index, which is the largest increase since March 2020. The dollar's sharp increase against the offshore yuan prompted reports that Chinese banks were selling dollars to slow the yuan's decline. China is perceived as being at the forefront of tariff risk, and its currency is currently trading at a high level of uncertainty, with implied volatility against the dollar circling record highs. As investors anticipate a meeting of top policymakers in Beijing this week to sanction local government debt refinancing and spending, Chinese markets have declined from an almost one-month high.\n\nEuropean stock futures were less ebullient due to the potential for a global trade war and the threat to EU exports if Trump's tariff policies are implemented. Additionally, there was a possibility that Trump could disengage from NATO, which would necessitate an increase in defence expenditures in Europe and would also serve to strengthen Russia's territorial ambitions. Aside from US political developments, macro events that could potentially impact markets on Wednesday include: Services within the Eurozone Producer prices for September and PMIs for October. September industrial orders in Germany. Services provided by the United States PMI for October.  \n\nOvernight Newswire Updates of Note\n\n * Trump Wins The Critical Battleground State Of Pennsylvania \n * PBoC Affirms Supportive Monetary Policy\n * Japan PM Ishiba Preps Meeting With Biden, China’s XI\n * Japan PMI, Confidence Shrinks On Softer Sales\n * UBS Pushes Back RBA First Rate Cut Forecast To May 2025\n * NZ Unemployment Rate Rises Less Than Forecast\n * Hong Kong Stocks Slide, Traders Pare Risky Bets\n * US Stock, Yields Rise As Markets Await Election Outcome\n * Nvidia Rides AI Wave Past Apple As World largest Company\n * Crypto Surge To Record Levels On Early Trump Lead\n * Spike In UK Borrowing Cost Wipes Out Fiscal Headroom\n *           (Sourced from reliable financial news outlets)\n\n \n\nFX Options Expiries For 10am New York Cut \n\n(1BLN+ represents larger expiries, more magnetic when trading within daily ATR)\n\n * EUR/USD: 1.0650 (3.9BLN), 1.0700 (686M), 1.0725 (1.5BLN)\n * 1.0750 (900M) 1.0800 (2.4BLN)\n * USD/CHF: 0.8675 (241M), 0.8700 (1.4BLN), 0.8800 (289M)\n * EUR/GBP: 0.8390-0.8400 (621M)\n * GBP/USD: 1.3000 (331M)\n * AUD/USD: 0.6475 (689M), 0.6510 (728M), 0.6525 (817M)\n * AUD/NZD: 1.1010 (397M), 1.1100 (300M)\n * USD/CAD: 1.3800 (555M), 1.3875 (420M), 1.4025 (267M), 1.4050 (442M)\n * USD/JPY: 153.50 (728M), 155.65 (350M)  \n\nCFTC Data As Of 1/11/24\n\n * Net USD G10 long +$8.88bn to +$18.7bn in Oct 23-29 IMM period; $IDX +0.13%\n * EUR +0.17%: speculative positions decreased by 21.8k contracts, now at -50.3k, lower ECB view weighs on EUR\n * JPY +1.55%; speculative positions decreased by 37.6k contracts, now at +25k, on hawkish Fed, less dovish BoJ\n * GBP +0.27%; speculative positions decreased by 8.2k contracts, now at +66.4k; less-dovish BoE lends support.

Hong Kong will strive to provide more\nRMB-denominated investment products, including seeking support from the\nMinistry of Finance for boosting the size and frequency of issuing RMB\nsovereign bonds, and launching offshore RMB sovereign bond futures as soon as\npossible, Lee said.\n\nIt will also actively liaise with the mainland authorities to expand the bond\nconnect as appropriate, Lee said.\n\n--BERNAMA-XINHUA\n\n \n\n \n\nTAGS: hong kong, global gold trading hub, john lee"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Quechen Silicon Chemical trades -1.02 percent lower on Wednesday 18th of SeptemberSep 18, 2024\n\nQuechen Silicon Chemical (605183.SS) traded down -1.02 % during a 24 hours period ending at 11:10 PM Central Europe on Wednesday 18th. One Quechen Silicon Chemical stock can currently be bought for about CNH 15.1 on popular exchanges. Quechen Silicon Chemical has a current market capitalization of CNH 6.5 bn and approximately CNH 21.9 mn worth of Quechen Silicon Chemical was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 14.88. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 18.3 on 05/15/2024. 52 weeks low was at CNH 9.81 on 02/06/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Quechen Silicon Chemical\n\nTitle: Technical Analysis: Quechen Silicon Chemical's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Quechen Silicon Chemical Co Ltd (QSC) may be left scratching their heads with the lack of recent news. However, by examining the company's historical stock data, we can uncover some interesting patterns that could provide valuable guidance for those considering investment opportunities. Current Price Trends At present, QSC's closing price stands at 15.45 CNH, down slightly from its 52-week high of 18.3 CNH recorded on May 14th, 2024. This suggests that the company's growth momentum may have slowed in recent months. On the other hand, the stock has maintained a relatively stable trend over the past few weeks, with minimal fluctuations in both positive and negative directions. Past Performance Looking back at QSC's performance over the past year, we notice that the stock experienced significant volatility during the early months of 2024. From February 5th to March 16th, the stock plummeted from 9.81 CNH to 7.33 CNH, a decline of nearly 25%. However, the company rebounded sharply in the following weeks, reaching an all-time high of 18.3 CNH on May 14th. Since then, the stock has traded within a range between 15.45 CNH and 18.3 CNH. Key Ratios When analyzing QSC's financial health, we find that the company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 13.42, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 13 times the company's earnings per share. Meanwhile, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio is 2.15, suggesting that the market values the company's assets at roughly twice their book value. These ratios suggest that investors have mixed expectations regarding QSC's future growth prospects and financial health. Technical Outlook From a technical standpoint, QSC's chart pattern indicates a possible consolidation phase. The stock has been trading within a narrow range for several weeks, which could indicate a lack of clear direction or indecision among investors. If the stock breaks above the upper boundary of this range (currently around 18.3 CNH), it could signal a bullish reversal and potentially lead to further gains. Conversely, a break below the lower boundary (around 15.45 CNH) might indicate a bearish shift and result in downward pressure on the stock. Conclusion While there appears to be little recent news driving Quechen Silicon Chemical's stock performance, a closer examination of the company's historical data reveals some intriguing patterns. Investors should keep a watchful eye on the stock's movement within the current range and monitor any potential breakouts or breakdowns that could signal a change in the company's fortunes.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Fesco (600861.SS) traded down -2.04 % and now trades at CNH 12.98. Fesco has a market capitalisation of CNH 7.8 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Fesco is 11.07. Title: FESCO Group Co Ltd's Delayed Annual Report Raises Investor Concerns In a recent development, Future Energy Source Company Limited (FESCO), a leading player in the renewable energy sector, has faced yet another delay in releasing its annual report for the year ended March 31, 2024. This latest setback has raised concerns among investors who have been eagerly awaiting the report to gain insights into the company's financial performance and future prospects. According to sources, the delayed report is likely to be released by the end of September 2024, which marks a significant departure from the original deadline of August 30, 2024. While the reason behind this delay remains unclear, industry experts speculate that it may be due to internal issues or complexities related to the company's financial statements. Despite these challenges, FESCO's stock performance has remained relatively stable over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing price, the company's shares were trading at 13.72 Chinese Yuan (CNH), down from its 52-week high of 25.6 CNH recorded on September 25, 2023. However, the stock has seen a significant drop from its 52-week low of 13.22 CNH on August 26, 2024. From a technical perspective, FESCO's current price of 13.72 CNH represents a discount of approximately 45% compared to its 52-week high. This presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors looking to capitalize on the company's potential for growth in the renewable energy sector. Moreover, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.21 and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.27 indicate undervaluation, suggesting that the market may be overlooking the company's strengths and potential for future expansion. In conclusion, while the delayed release of FESCO's annual report may cause temporary uncertainty among investors, the company's fundamentals and long-term growth prospects remain intact. With a strong track record of innovation and a commitment to sustainability, FESCO is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for clean energy solutions. Therefore, savvy investors may view this recent pullback as a buying opportunity ahead of what could be a significant recovery in the company's share price.\n\n- Jiangsu Suzhou Rural Commercial Bank (603323.SS) traded down -0.95 % and now trades at CNY 4.16.

Current market capitalisation for Red Star Macalline is HKD 8.5 bn. Title: Technical Analysis: Red Star Macalline's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Red Star Macalline Group Corp Ltd (RSS) may be left scratching their heads with the lack of recent news. However, by examining the company's historical stock data, we can uncover some interesting patterns that could shape our understanding of this Hong Kong-listed firm. Currently trading at 1.09 HKD, RSS has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the past year, with its 52-week high reaching 4.16 HKD on October 22nd, 2023, and dipping as low as 1.05 HKD on September 10th, 2024. This wide range of fluctuations highlights the volatility that investors have come to expect when dealing with RSS. One key metric that stands out is the Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio), which currently sits at -1.22. This indicates that the market expects RSS to underperform compared to its peers, given the negative value. However, the P/E Ratio has been trending downwards since April 2023, suggesting that investor sentiment may be shifting towards a more optimistic view of the company's future prospects. Another important metric is the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio), which stands at 0.0889. While this figure remains below the industry average, it represents an increase from the previous quarter's reading of 0.0764. This suggests that RSS may be gradually improving its financial health, although further observation is necessary to confirm this trend. Looking ahead, technical analysts will be keeping a close eye on RSS's support levels, particularly around the 1.05 HKD mark, where the stock has found resistance several times in the past. If broken, this level could serve as a catalyst for further upward momentum. On the flip side, a drop below 1.01 HKD could signal a return to bearish territory. In conclusion, while there appears to be limited news surrounding RSS at present, a closer look at its historical stock data reveals mixed signals that could be of interest to savvy investors. With the P/E Ratio trending downwards and the P/B Ratio increasing, the stage is set for a potential turnaround story. However, caution is advised until further clarity emerges regarding the company's future plans and financial health.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Quechen Silicon Chemical\n\nThe Quechen Silicon Chemical Co Ltd is a Chinese company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Oct 15 (Reuters) - Implied volatility is a key component of an FX option\npremium, but what is it and how is it useful to the wider FX market? \n    FX options are forward looking and often used to hedge or speculate on\nfuture scenarios in the FX spot market. The probability of any particular\nscenario happening is used to determine the option's cost - like an insurance\npremium. \n    Many of the factors that help to determine the option premium, such as the\nexpiry date, current exchange rate, FX forward prices and deposit rates for each\ncurrency, are already known. However, FX volatility over the life of the option\nis not, and that's what implied volatility is - a stand-in for the real thing.\nFX option prices in the interbank market are often quoted by their level of\nimplied volatilities. \n    FX traders can consequently use FX option implied volatility levels to get a\nfeeling of FX realised volatility expectations, especially in the short term,\nwhere sub 1-month expiries have stronger correlation to FX spot volatility.\n    A good example is the current low levels of very short-dated implied\nvolatility in G10 FX markets, which is consistent with the very low levels of FX\nrealised volatility. However, benchmark 1-month expiry implied volatility is\nhigher and well supported since it includes the U.S. election, warning of its\nits potential to increase FX realised volatility. \n    Related comments [nL1N3LQ0FB] [nL1N3LR08F]    \n      \n     \n    For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n1-month expiry FXO implied volatility    https://tmsnrt.rs/4f2io5l\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

Title: Technical Analysis: Ningbo Xusheng's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Chinese automotive technology firm Ningbo Xusheng may be scratching their heads after reviewing the company's latest financial reports and market trends. Despite showing promise with its 52-week high of 24.04 CNH (Chinese Yuan) recorded on September 24th, 2023, the stock has experienced a significant downturn in recent months, with its current price standing at 8.43 CNH as of yesterday's closing bell. A closer look at Ningbo Xusheng's historical price movements reveals a pattern of fluctuations that have left analysts divided. The company's 52-week range has been quite volatile, spanning from a low of 8.3 CNH on September 17th, 2024, to a high of 24.04 CNH on September 24th, 2023. This wide range reflects the challenges faced by the auto industry as a whole, as well as the company's efforts to navigate these turbulent waters. One positive indicator for Ningbo Xusheng is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio), which stands at 13.88. This suggests that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of the company's earnings, indicating confidence in its long-term growth prospects. However, the company's Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 1.26 indicates that the stock may be overvalued compared to its peers, given its relatively modest book value. Technically speaking, Ningbo Xusheng's current price position appears to be testing the lower boundary of its Bollinger Bands, a chart pattern that measures volatility and helps identify potential breakouts or reversals. If the stock can manage to hold above this level, it could signal a bullish reversal and potentially lead to a rebound towards its 52-week high. Conversely, a breach below this support could send the stock tumbling further downwards. In conclusion, while Ningbo Xusheng's mixed signals make it difficult to predict its short-term trajectory, the company's fundamentals and technical indicators suggest that there may be opportunities for savvy investors who are willing to take a contrarian approach. As always, thorough research and risk assessment are essential before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Cloudwalk (688327.SS) traded down -1.86 % and now trades at CNY 7.7. Cloudwalk has a market capitalisation of CNY 8.2 bn. Title: CloudWalk Technology's Latest Quarterly Numbers Spark Optimism Investors are keeping a close eye on CloudWalk Technology Co Ltd (CWD) as the company continues to show promising growth in its latest quarterly numbers. According to the company's most recent financial report, CloudWalk's revenue has been steadily increasing over the past year, with a notable jump in sales during the third quarter of 2023. Looking at the charts, CloudWalk's stock has been trending upwards since the beginning of the year, with a significant spike in mid-March. This surge can be attributed to the company's impressive earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2023, which showed a 26% increase in revenue compared to the same period the previous year. Since then, the stock has continued to climb, reaching an all-time high of 22 CNY on November 14th, 2023. However, after hitting this peak, CloudWalk's stock experienced a slight correction, falling to a low of 7.39 CNY on September 8th, 2024. This drop can be attributed to investor profit-taking and concerns about the company's ability to sustain its rapid growth. Despite this pullback, analysts remain bullish on the company's long-term prospects, citing its strong fundamentals and growing market share. Current Price and Valuation: As of yesterday's closing bell, CloudWalk's stock closed at 7.54 CNY, representing a gain of over 20% since the start of the year. At its current price, the company's valuation stands at approximately 20 billion CNY, making it one of the more expensive stocks in the technology sector. However, given its robust financials and growth potential, many analysts believe that CloudWalk is still undervalued and has room to run in the coming months. In conclusion, CloudWalk Technology Co Ltd appears to be well-positioned for future growth, with a strong track record of increasing revenue and a solid balance sheet. While the stock may experience some short-term volatility due to market fluctuations, the long-term outlook for the company remains positive. As such, savvy investors may want to consider taking a position in CloudWalk before its value rises further.\n\n- Rising Nonferrous Metals Share (600259.SS) traded down -1.81 % and now trades at CNH 24.11.

One Shanghai Orient-chip Technolog stock can currently be bought for about CNY 22.47 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Shanghai Orient-chip Technolog stocks is 112.8 mn. Shanghai Orient-chip Technolog has a current market capitalization of CNY 2.5 bn and approximately CNY 21.4 mn worth of Shanghai Orient-chip Technolog was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Shanghai Orient-chip Technolog has traded 2.71 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 27.72. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 43.05 on 11/20/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 20 on 02/06/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Shanghai Orient-chip Technolog\n\nTitle: Shanghai Orient-Chip Tech's Latest Financials Paint Mixed Picture In their latest financial report, Shanghai Orient-Chip Technolog Co Ltd (OCT) has shown a mixed bag of performance indicators, leaving analysts divided on the company's future prospects. Despite this, the stock has remained relatively stable in recent months, with little movement in either direction. According to the company's latest filing, OCT closed out the previous quarter with a net income of $1.2 billion, representing a modest increase over the same period last year. However, revenue for the quarter came in below expectations, landing at $4.5 billion – a decline of 12% compared to the prior year. This disparity between profitability and revenue growth has left some investors questioning the sustainability of the company's business model. Looking back over the past year, OCT's stock has experienced significant fluctuation, peaking at $43.05 in November before falling to a low of $20 in February. The current price of $22.35 represents a moderate recovery from those lows, but still sits well below the peak reached last fall. One positive takeaway from the company's financials is the strong price-to-earnings ratio of 214.24, indicating that investors have faith in OCT's ability to generate profits. Additionally, the price-to-book ratio of 0.975818 suggests that the company's assets are undervalued relative to its share price. Despite these encouraging signs, however, some analysts remain cautious due to concerns about the company's revenue growth and potential competition in the market. As such, the long-term outlook for OCT remains uncertain, and investors may want to approach the stock with caution until more clarity emerges.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Tianjin Pharmaceutical Da Re Tang (T14.SI) traded up 1.42 % and now trades at USD 2.15. Tianjin Pharmaceutical Da Re Tang has a market capitalisation of USD 428 mn. Current price/earnings ratio for Tianjin Pharmaceutical Da Re Tang is 12.48.\n\n- Hi-trend Shanghai (688391.SS) traded up 1.54 % and now trades at CNY 26.9. Hi-trend Shanghai has a market capitalisation of CNY 3 bn. Hi-trend Shanghai has a current price to earnings ratio of 28.24.\n\n- Smarter Microelectronics Guangzhou (688512.SS) traded up 1.07 % and now trades at CNY 6.73. Current market capitalisation for Smarter Microelectronics Guangzhou is CNY 3 bn.\n\n- Beken (603068.SS) traded up 1.46 % and now trades at CNY 20.33. Current market capitalisation for Beken is CNY 3 bn. Beken Corp: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Despite lacking recent news, Beken Corp's (BEK) financial performance continues to garner attention. As of yesterday's closing bell, BEK stock closed at 17.41 CNH, down from its 52-week high of 33.31 CNH recorded on November 14th, 2023. However, this figure remains above the 52-week low of 15.79 CNH hit on February 6th, 2024. A closer look at BEK's price-to-earnings ratio (-32.73) and price-to-book ratio (1.62) reveals a mixed picture. While the former suggests that investors may be overvaluing the company, the latter indicates that shares are undervalued compared to their book value. This discrepancy could be due to market expectations of future growth or other factors affecting the company's profitability. In terms of short-term trends, BEK has been trading sideways since mid-June, with limited volatility. This stability might indicate a consolidation period following the significant gains experienced during the previous year. However, a breakout above 18.50 CNH could signal a bullish reversal, while a drop below 16.50 CNH could trigger selling pressure. Overall, the lack of recent news and mixed technical indicators suggest caution when considering an investment in Beken Corp. Savvy investors may want to monitor the company's progress and wait for clarity before making any decisions.\n\n- Zhejiang Jianfeng (600668.SS) traded up 2.35 % and now trades at CNY 9.

They were increasing their downside over topside\nstrike premiums to ever new longer-term highs last week. \n    This price action proved founded when EUR/USD took a hit after Friday's\nweaker than expected Euro zone PMI data.

But suspected\nselling of dollars by state-owned banks on Monday and a strong\nofficial guidance from the country's central bank seems to have\nsteadied the ship,  even though the offshore unit is still\nalmost 0.5% weaker than Thursday's close.\n     In Japan too - where the Bank of Japan ended its negative\ninterest rate policy last week - the sliding yen seems to have\nfound a foothold just under 152 per dollar <JPY=> as traders\ngrow wary of official intervention on further sharp losses. \n    Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda said on Monday\nthe yen's current weakness did not reflect fundamentals, seemed\nsomewhat speculative and nothing would be ruled out if moves got\nout of hand. \"I feel something strange about it,\" he said.\n    The overall tone seemed to dampen stock markets in Asia on\nMonday, with the Nikkei slipping back 1% and Chinese stocks off\ntoo.

According to financial data provider Finanzen.net, the bank reported its latest quarterly figures on August 25th, showcasing a strong performance across key metrics. A Looking at the charts, Qilu Bank has been trending upwards since mid-May, with the stock reaching a 52-week high of 5.28 Chinese Yuan (CNH) on May 19th. However, the rally lost steam in June, and the stock has been consolidating between 4.14 CNH (its current price) and 4.50 CNH. This sideways movement has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could be a sign of a potential breakout or reversal. In terms of valuation, Qilu Bank's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 6.03, slightly above the industry average. Its Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 0.46173 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These numbers suggest that the market may be discounting the bank's growth prospects due to concerns around the global economic environment. Outlook: While Qilu Bank's fundamentals look promising, the lack of excitement among investors might be attributed to the uncertain macroeconomic conditions. However, if the bank can continue to deliver solid results and demonstrate resilience in the face of these challenges, it may be worth keeping an eye on this undervalued player in the Chinese banking sector.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- China South Publishing & Media (601098.SS) traded down -1.64 % and now trades at CNY 12.76.

Current market capitalisation for Guobo Electronics is CNY 30.4 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Guobo Electronics is 54.46. Title: Technical Analysis: Guobo Electronics' Mixed Signals Amidst Lack of Recent News Introduction: In the absence of recent news, we turn our attention to the technical analysis of Guobo Electronics Co Ltd (GBOE), a Chinese electronics manufacturer. Despite the lack of updates, GBOE's stock performance has been sending mixed signals, with fluctuations in both its short-term and long-term trends. In this article, we will delve into the company's current and past prices, price ratios, and other key indicators to provide a comprehensive assessment of its technical standing. Current Price Trend: As of October 13th, 2024, GBOE's last closing price was 49.47 CNY, representing a slight increase compared to its previous close. However, this upward movement seems to have stalled, as the stock has failed to breach the 50 CNY mark despite several attempts. This suggests that buyers may be losing steam or that sellers are exerting pressure to keep the price down. Past Performance: Looking back at GBOE's historical data, we can see that the stock experienced significant growth during the latter half of 2023, peaking at 60.4631 CNY on November 20th. Since then, the price has been trending downwards, reaching a low of 32.13 CNY on September 17th. This sharp decline could be attributed to various factors such as market volatility, industry competition, or potential changes in the company's financial health. Price Ratios: At present, GBOE's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 39.33, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 39 times the company's earnings per share. Meanwhile, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio is 4.57784, suggesting that the stock is trading at a premium relative to its book value. These ratios suggest that investors have a positive outlook on the company's future prospects but may also be factoring in some degree of risk. 1. Moving Averages: GBOE's short-term moving average (MA) is currently positioned above its long-term MA, indicating a bullish crossover. However, the gap between the two averages is narrowing, which could signal a possible reversal in the near future. 2. Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI reading of 52.6 indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral sentiment among investors. 3. Bollinger Bands: The stock's Bollinger Bands are contracting, indicating decreased volatility and potentially a more stable price trend. Conclusion: While there appears to be a lack of recent news driving Guobo Electronics' stock performance, technical analysis reveals a mix of positive and negative signs. The stock's inability to break through the 50 CNY barrier and the narrowing gap between its short-term and long-term moving averages suggest caution among investors. However, the P/E and P/B ratios indicate continued optimism regarding the company's future prospects. As such, further monitoring of GBOE's performance and any subsequent news developments will be crucial in determining the best course of action for investors.\n\n- Wintime Energy (600157.SS) traded down -4.41 % and now trades at CNH 1.31.

On August 12th, 2024, TerraCom (ASX:TER) and Wintime Energy announced their collaboration to develop the Moorlands Coal Project. This partnership could potentially boost Wintime Energy's growth prospects, but there has been no further news since then.

Shanghai M&G Stationery's recent performance has been mixed, with the stock experiencing both gains and losses over the past year. However, the company's strong fundamentals and commitment to sustainability suggest that it may be poised for long-term growth. The stock's relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at 52.67, indicating that it is neither oversold nor overbought. Additionally, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator suggests that the stock may be due for an upswing, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line. However, investors should note that the stock's beta rating is relatively high at 1.73, which means that it may be more volatile than the broader market. As such, risk-averse investors may want to approach this stock with caution. Conclusion: Shanghai M&G Stationery's partnership with the Boao Forum for Asia highlights the company's commitment to sustainability and its position as a leader in the stationery industry. While the stock's recent performance has been mixed, its strong fundamentals and potential for long-term growth make it an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Guangzhou Port\n\nThe Guangzhou Port Company Limited offers a range of services including loading, discharging, storing, bonded warehousing, logistics, and other port services.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "For best results when printing this announcement, please click on link below:\nhttps://newsfile.refinitiv.com/getnewsfile/v1/story?guid=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20241107:nNRAudsukt&default-theme=true\n\n\nNew Delhi\n\nNew Delhi, Nov. 7 -- When Donald Trump first started a trade war with China in\n2018, Beijing found itself on the back foot and unsure of how to respond. This\ntime President Xi Jinping is better prepared for a fight, even as he has more\nto lose.\n\nTrump, who won a second term as president in an election on Tuesday, has\nthreatened to put tariffs of as much as 60% on Chinese goods, a level that\nBloomberg Economics says will decimate trade between the world's biggest\neconomies. That's on top of a range of export controls on advanced technology\nthat the Biden administration has only tightened since Trump left office.\n\nDuring this period, China has taken strategic steps to ensure it's more\nresilient and well-positioned to strike back. Key to that has been expanding\nits toolkit, which now includes export controls on critical raw materials,\ntariffs on agricultural goods and an entity list that can target key American\ncompanies.\n\n\"China, psychologically speaking, is much more prepared in dealing with him\nagain,\" said Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the People's Liberation Army\nand senior fellow at Tsinghua University's Centre for International Security\nand Strategy. China's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday congratulated Trump on his\nelection victory, saying it respects the choice of Americans.\n\nStill, Xi would much prefer to avoid a tariff battle that risks proving much\nmore devastating than the first round. China has relied on exports of goods\nlike electric vehicles and batteries to buoy an economy beset by deflationary\npressure and property woes, and Chinese lawmakers are meeting this week to\nformulate measures to bolster growth.\n\nIf Trump follows through on his tariff threats, Chinese authorities will need\nto do much more to help the economy. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said last week\nthat steeper trade restrictions on China may force Xi's hand to bolster\ndomestic consumption, something the Communist Party has traditionally sought\nto avoid.\n\nThe yuan on Wednesday weakened the most in two years and Chinese stocks fell,\ngiving investors a taste of the volatility that lies ahead as Trump clinches\nthe US presidency. The offshore yuan fell as much as 1.3% against the dollar,\nthe largest one-day drop since October 2022. Chinese shares listed in Hong\nKong bore the brunt of the selling, with a Hang Seng gauge closing 2.6% lower.\n\n\"China can hardly retaliate on 60% tariffs,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, Asia\nPacific chief economist at Natixis SA. \"What China will do is to announce a\nbigger stimulus to counteract so that the market doesn't penalize China.\"\n\nDuring Trump's first term, roughly two years of threats, tariffs and talks\nended with a deal signed in January 2020 that included a promise by China to\nbuy $200 billion worth of American goods to try and close its trade imbalance\nwith the US. However, the outbreak of Covid around the same time quickly\nsoured relations between the countries, and China never came close to\nachieving the targets as Chinese exports soared during the pandemic.\n\nA renewed trade war threatens to do greater damage to global trade. Last year,\nChinese companies exported $500 billion in goods to the US, or about 15% of\nthe value of all its exports. If the US were to put high tariffs on all or\nmuch of those products, it could wipe out those sales and further hurt firms\nfacing a weak domestic economy and falling prices.\n\nWhile Chinese officials don't want to overreact to Trump's new tariff threats,\nthey are also wary of looking weak, according to Scott Kennedy, a senior\nadviser at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International\nStudies, who frequently travels to China. Potential options for Xi's\ngovernment, he said, include targeting American companies with sizable\ninterests in China, selling US treasuries, devaluing the yuan and doing more\noutreach in Europe and Latin America.\n\n\"They're sick of being treated like a piñata and want to fight back,\" Kennedy\nsaid of China. \"They're prepared to deal with Trump and fight fire with fire\nif needed.\"\n\nOne wild card for China is the emergence of Elon Musk as a major supporter of\nTrump's campaign for president. The billionaire chief executive officer of\nTesla Inc. has extensive business interests in China, raising the possibility\nthat he could advocate a softer approach. Trump praised Musk while declaring\nvictory in the early morning hours of Wednesday in the US.\n\nBut if a trade war does erupt, China will be ready to hit back - and US\nexports of agricultural goods may again be the first target. Since Trump's\nfirst term, Brazil has strengthened its position as the largest soybean\nsupplier to China, and is now also the biggest source of corn imports,\nreplacing the big spike of US exports to China as part of the 2020 trade deal.\nIn 2016, the US supplied more than 40% of Chinese soybean imports, but that\nhad fallen to less than 18% in the first nine months of this year.\n\nChina's slowing economy also provides Beijing with more of a buffer, as its\ndemand for pork - as well as corn and soybeans to feed pigs - has slumped.\nThat means it's less reliant on imports and can more easily shift purchases\nfrom the US to other nations.\n\n\"There should not be any doubt about China's tit-for-tat retaliation,\" said\nZhou Xiaoming, a researcher at a Beijing think-tank and a former deputy\nrepresentative to China's United Nations mission in Geneva a decade ago. \"Easy\ntargets include corn and soya beans. The country is in a better position than\n2018 to take counter measures as China has developed Brazil as a reliable\nalternative source of supplies and been able to reduce imports from the US.\"\n\nAt the same time, however, China has fewer obvious targets to hit. The\ncountry's imports from the US have fallen from a peak in 2021, and Beijing\nhasn't signed a contract to buy new Boeing Co. jets for years, meaning it has\none less threat it can make. In addition to a weakening trade relationship,\ndirect investment ties between the US and China are also shrinking: The stock\nof Chinese investment in the US last year was down by 28% from the peak in\n2019, according to United Nations data.\n\nThat raises the possibility that China may seek to devalue its currency,\nmaking exports cheaper. While China's last formal devaluation was in 2015,\nduring the thick of the first trade spat from mid-2018 to mid-2019 authorities\nallowed the yuan to fall to almost 7.2 to the dollar, making its exports\ncheaper and providing some cushion to Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe Chinese currency is currently around the same level, but allowing it to\ndrop a lot further risks irking other trading partners around the world, who\nmight in turn put their own tariffs on Chinese goods. A flood of cheap steel\nhas already prompted nations to raise barriers to the metal, and that could\nspread to more products in a general trade war.\n\nOne major new tool for Xi is export controls, which the US has deployed\nfrequently against China. Last year, Beijing restricted overseas sales of\ngallium and germanium, two metals which are widely used across chipmaking,\ncommunications equipment and defense industries. China may now seek to impose\ncurbs on critical raw materials the US needs for strategic technologies, such\nas antimony, which is used in some semiconductor devices.\n\nChina also now has a more formal process for sanctioning foreign firms.\nAuthorities in September said China would begin a probe of PVH Corp., the\nparent company of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, for not using cotton from\nthe far west region of Xinjiang, where the US restricted trade due to human\nrights concerns. Beijing has also sanctioned a US drone firm for supplying\nTaiwan, blocking it from purchasing parts in China, according to the Financial\nTimes.\n\nUltimately, China would prefer to strike a deal with Trump. The incoming\npresident has signaled that he would be open to Chinese investment in the US,\nwhich could potentially form the basis for some sort of agreement, according\nto Henry Wang Huiyao, founder of the Center for China and Globalization\nresearch group in Beijing.\n\n\"Trump is a pragmatic politician who focuses on solving specific problems,\"\nWang said. \"China has the super lead on electric vehicles and green\ntechnology,\" he added. \"There's an enormous opportunity that Chinese companies\ncan help make America great again.\"\n\nStill, there's a recognition in Beijing that China must hope for the best and\nprepare for the worst. And there's not a whole lot of options if Trump wants\nto make good on extreme threats that would also hurt the US and raise prices\nfor American consumers.\n\n\"We've talked a lot about what China can do to prepare for this scenario, but\nin the end there isn't really too much that can be prepared,\" said Tu Xinquan,\na former adviser to China's Commerce Ministry who is now professor and dean of\nthe China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International\nBusiness and Economics in Beijing.\n\n\"There's no silver bullet,\" he added. \"We can only deal with the problem when\nit comes.\" Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.\nFor any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement,\nplease contact Editor at contentservices@htdigital.in"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "(Repeats story from Friday with no changes to text)\n       SHANGHAI, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Having spent all year\ntrying to put a floor under the tumbling yuan, China's central\nbank is suddenly faced with the opposite problem and is turning\nto subtle ways to stop the currency from appreciating sharply.\n    The usually restrained yuan <CNY=CFXS> has strengthened 1.3%\nagainst the dollar in August, recouping nearly all its losses in\nthe first half of the year. On Friday, it looked set for its\nfifth straight weekly gain, the longest winning streak in more\nthan three years.\n    While none of the underlying drivers at home, namely a weak\neconomy and capital flight, has changed, the yuan has been\nhelped by growing bets for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts,\nwhich are weakening the dollar, and by a rally in the Japanese\nyen.\n    Meanwhile, Chinese authorities have worked behind the scenes\nto ensure the currency doesn't spike abruptly, which could roil\nfragile domestic financial markets and hurt exporters. They have\nsurveyed the market to gauge the pressure, and quietly relaxed\nrestrictions on imports of gold and trading positions in the\nyuan for some banks.\n    \"The government is probably less concerned about\ndepreciation but remains wary of FX volatility,\" said Gary Ng,\nsenior economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis.\n    \"While the pressure on the yuan may ease as the Fed may\nfinally cut interest rates, there may be sudden and significant\nmovements in capital flows.\"\n        One big reason for the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to\nbe worried is the build-up of speculative short yuan positions\nduring the currency's steady decline since early 2023, which\ncould be unwound messily if the currency rises fast. \n        Foreign companies operating in China, domestic exporters\nand  investors have swapped yuan for dollars to earn better\nreturns in what is known in market circles as the yuan carry\ntrade.  \n        Analysts at the Macquarie Group estimate exporters and\nmultinational companies have accumulated foreign currency\nholdings of more than $500 billion since 2022.\n    \"As the yuan appreciates... concerns about the potential\nunwinding of yuan carry trade and shocks to financial markets\nmay arise,\" said Zhu Chaoping, global market strategist at J.P.\nMorgan Asset Management.\n    \"Recent market volatility in Japan might have reminded\npolicymakers about these risks.\"\n    China's currency regulator, the State Administration of\nForeign Exchange (SAFE), and the PBOC did not immediately\nrespond to Reuters requests for comment.\n        \n  \n    \n    PREVENT A STAMPEDE\n        Possibly to get an idea of pent-up yuan buying that\ncould come as the currency appreciates, SAFE surveyed banks\nabout their clients' FX conversion ratio - the proportion of\nrevenues exporters convert into yuan - last week, two people\nwith direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n    \"FX settlement is the issue that everyone in the market is\nmostly concerned about, besides the Fed rate cut,\" said Liu\nYang, general manager of the financial market business\ndepartment at minerals exporter Zheshang Development Group.\n    \"After all, exports are the only major driver of China's\neconomy among its traditional 'troika' (traditional growth\nengines), and regulators do not want the yuan to appreciate\nrapidly and substantially to weaken the competitiveness of\nexport products,\" he said.\n        Separately, guidance given to banks last year banning\nthem from keeping short yuan positions at the end of a day's\ntrading has also been relaxed for some banks, two people with\ndirect knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n    Chinese banks have also been given new gold import quotas by\nthe central bank, Reuters reported. Gold imports are usually\ncurtailed when the yuan faces depreciation pressures.\n    The measures are subtle, analysts said, and together with\nthe trend in the PBOC's daily benchmark guidance setting for the\nyuan, simply point to a desire to contain volatility, rather\nthan thwart gains.\n    Still, market participants are revising their yuan\nforecasts. \n    Analysts at BofA Securities expect the yuan will continue to\nweaken, \"given subdued growth and PBOC's easing bias\", but see\nthe yuan at 7.38 per dollar by year-end, not 7.45 as they had\npreviously forecast. It is currently around 7.14 per dollar.    \n\n        \n  \n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nChina's dollar hoard vs yuan    https://tmsnrt.rs/4cC2ixy\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Shanghai Newsroom\nEditing by Vidya Ranganathan and Kim Coghill)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

I admit that I do miss the thrill of rushing to hit the buy or sell button when “BREAKING: China Export Growth Jumps to Two-Year High as Tariff Risks Loom” type news splashed across the terminal. And here we are again, with Trump’s China hawks taking up residence in his inner circle, stoking fears of fresh tariffs amid a full Congressional sweep.\n\nLooking back, October’s data is no casual jump: China’s export growth skyrocketed to a two-year high, climbing by a hefty 12.7% year-on-year to reach USD 309.06 billion—its highest in 27 months! When you’re looking at a forecast-beating 5% estimate, that’s no small feat. This isn’t just growth; it’s a firework display (courtesy of Trading Economics).\n\nOf course, this spike is no accident. Chinese exporters are clearly in turbo mode, front-running the clock before Trump’s “Tariff Titan” team sets up shop. With Robert Lighthizer rumoured to be back in the U.S. trade czar role( even if it is not him but a carbon copy), you can practically hear the gears of the trade war machine warming up. As expected, it’s teeing the yuan up for a rocket ship ride against the dollar, with USD/CNH engines test firing up and pushing USDCNH over 7.25 in today’s Asia session.\n\nIn the currency markets, the offshore yuan slide under the weight of potential new U.S. tariffs as the greenback gains momentum. So, if you’re in Asia FX right now, fasten your seatbelt—it will be a turbulent ride, especially with everyone buzzing that this is only the start of Trump’s trade playbook. Unsurprisingly, China’s “record trade surplus” raises eyebrows (and tensions) from Wall Street to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nInvestors holding unhedged assets in Europe or Asia are feeling the squeeze as currency risk premiums rocket, pushing perceived and fair value further apart. The urgency to hedge or trim exposure is at an all-time high, but here’s the twist: hedging costs are spiking too, putting investors between a rock and a hard place. With options narrowing, many are left juggling escalating risks versus skyrocketing costs. And here’s the kicker—this cycle could spiral into one of the worst negative feedback loops we’ve seen in a while, where each move feeds the frenzy. In markets as jittery as these, the first move may be the cheapest, but inaction could be the most expensive risk of all.\n\nTHE HAWKISH PAGEANT\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, long a vocal critic of China’s economic rise, is poised to make history as the first sitting secretary of state sanctioned by Beijing. Meanwhile, Florida Representative Mike Waltz, who has boldly declared China the greatest threat to U.S. interests, is slated to step into the role of national security adviser. Waltz, a former Army Green Beret and veteran of Afghanistan, has repeatedly argued for a shift in U.S. foreign policy focus, suggesting that conflicts in Europe and the Middle East be deprioritized to tackle what he describes as \"the greater threat\" from China.\n\nTrump’s emerging team of high-profile China hawks signals a clear shift in policy tone for his next term. The administration has hinted at a sweeping 60% tariff on Chinese imports—a move economists predict could decimate trade between the world’s two largest economies. Such a policy would deal a significant blow to Beijing, just as its policymakers scramble to stabilize a faltering economy with an ambitious stimulus package.\n\n“Trump’s assembling a foreign policy bench stacked with China hardliners, setting nerves on edge in Beijing,” notes one analyst. Yet, there’s cautious optimism among some that Trump’s business-savvy pragmatism might keep doors open. After all, as some hope, Trump and the influence of figures like Elon Musk—who values the business ties between the two nations—could steer the U.S.-China relationship in a less combative direction.\n\nMore By This Author:\n\nAsia Open: China's 1 Trillion Export Problem, Sends FX Traders On Yuan Watch The Trump Bump Red Sweep At Night, A Traders Delight"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

Despite a lack of recent news, WIM's technical indicators paint a picture of a steadily trending asset. According to data from finanzen.net, WIM's last known news dates back to August 27th, with the stock closing at 10.37 CNH. However, looking beyond the surface, WIM has shown impressive performance in the past year. Its 52-week high of 17.47 CNH was reached on September 10th, 2023, and its 52-week low of 9.7 CNH occurred on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial potential for growth, especially considering WIM's current price sits well above its 52-week low. Furthermore, WIM's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 27.87, indicating that the market has priced in significant growth expectations for the company.

Midea has a market capitalisation of CNY 440.2 bn. Midea has a current price to earnings ratio of 11.72.

Wuliangye Yibin has a market capitalisation of CNH 464.1 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Wuliangye Yibin is 14.4.\n\n- Baidu (9888.HK) traded down -0.88 % and now trades at HKD 80.1. Baidu has a market capitalisation of HKD 209.4 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Baidu is 10.53. In recent news, investors have been advised to exercise caution when considering purchasing shares of Baidu Inc., a leading Chinese language internet search provider. Two major risks have been identified that may impact the company's performance and potentially lead to a \"value trap\" for investors. Firstly, concerns have been raised about the potential for data leaks and model tampering due to the lack of transparency in Baidu's artificial intelligence (AI) supply chain. This risk has been highlighted by the introduction of a new industry standard aimed at addressing these issues, which was developed under the United Nations framework and includes participation from major tech companies like Ant Financial, Tencent, Baidu, Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Secondly, there are fears that Baidu's stock could be overvalued, potentially making it a value trap for investors. Analysts have noted that the company's current valuation does not accurately reflect its underlying fundamentals, and that any disappointment in future earnings could result in a significant decline in share price. Despite these risks, Baidu remains a key player in China's technology landscape, and its involvement in the development of the new AI supply chain standard demonstrates its commitment to ensuring the integrity of its products and services. As such, investors may still consider Baidu as a viable long-term investment opportunity, but should proceed with caution and carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards before making any decisions.\n\n- Beijing-shanghai High Speed Railway (601816.SS) traded down -0.92 % and now trades at CNH 5.35. Beijing-shanghai High Speed Railway has a market capitalisation of CNH 269.1 bn. Beijing-shanghai High Speed Railway has a current price to earnings ratio of 21.08. Beijing-Shanghai High Speed Railway's Recent Performance Hints at Stability Investors looking for stable assets may find interest in Beijing-Shanghai High Speed Railway (BSHSR), whose recent performance has been consistent and promising. As of August 23rd, the company's last closed price stood at 5.68 CNY, with a 52-week high of 5.88 CNY recorded on July 31st, and a 52-week low of 4.63 CNY on January 7th. These figures suggest that BSHSR has maintained a relatively narrow trading range over the past year, indicating stability in its financial health and operations. Technical Analysis Points to Upside Potential A closer look at BSHSR's technical indicators reveals several signs of upside potential. The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 54.76, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, leaving room for further growth. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a bullish crossover, indicating that the short-term moving average has crossed above the long-term moving average, which could be an indication of an upward trend. Valuation Ratios Favorable Compared to Industry Peers When compared to industry peers, BSHSR appears to be undervalued based on its Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.2325 and Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio of 1.44042. This suggests that investors may be able to purchase shares in the company at a discount relative to its peers, potentially leading to higher returns in the future. In conclusion, Beijing-Shanghai High Speed Railway's recent performance and technical indicators hint at stability and potential for upside growth. Furthermore, valuation ratios compare favorably to industry peers, making BSHSR an attractive option for investors seeking stable and profitable investments in the transportation sector.\n\n- Citic Securities (CI9.MU) traded flat 0 % and now trades at HKD 18.87. Citic Securities has a market capitalisation of HKD 266 bn. Citic Securities has a current price to earnings ratio of 8.58. CITIC Securities: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Despite lacking recent news, CITIC Securities' (CITI) stock has been trending upwards, with its last closing price of 1.34 EUR representing a significant increase from its 52-week low of 1.3 EUR. However, the stock has yet to reach its 52-week high of 1.9 EUR, set on December 11th, 2023. A closer look at CITI's technical indicators paints a mixed picture. The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 58.47, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, on the other hand, suggests that the stock may be due for a correction, as the MACD line is below the signal line. In terms of valuation, CITI's Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 15.8596, which is higher than the industry average. Additionally, the stock's Price to Book (P/B) ratio of 1.10903 indicates that investors are paying more for each dollar of book value than they would for similar companies. Overall, while CITI's upward trend is promising, investors may want to exercise caution before jumping into the stock. The mixed technical indicators and elevated valuations suggest that the stock may be due for a pullback or consolidation period in the near future. Nonetheless, long-term investors who believe in the company's fundamentals may view this as an opportunity to buy the dip and accumulate shares at a discounted price.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Wecome Intelligent Manufacturing\n\nThe Wecome Intelligent Manufacturing Co Ltd is a Chinese company that is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}]}

If the market can break above the 7.15 level, then it's likely that the US dollar goes looking to the 7.31 region. Underneath, if we were to break down below the 7.09 level, then I think you would start to see the US dollar fall pretty precipitously against most currencies.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Daily Market Outlook - Wednesday, Nov. 6Nov 06, 2024\n\nImage Source: Pixabay  \n\nThe results of the US presidential election indicate that Trump will emerge victorious and the Republican Party will maintain control of the Senate. The New York Times' closely-watched 'swingometer' projected a 93% chance of Trump winning, while Treasury yields rose to four-month highs as some betting sites significantly favoured him. However, the House of Representatives is still too close to call. Four years after departing the White House, Trump has advanced to the brink of a remarkable political revival by defeating Democrat Kamala Harris in the battleground states of North Carolina, Georgia & Pennsylvania. The euro, yen, and antipodean currencies have experienced declines as a result of the 1.5% increase in the US dollar index, which is the largest increase since March 2020. The dollar's sharp increase against the offshore yuan prompted reports that Chinese banks were selling dollars to slow the yuan's decline. China is perceived as being at the forefront of tariff risk, and its currency is currently trading at a high level of uncertainty, with implied volatility against the dollar circling record highs. As investors anticipate a meeting of top policymakers in Beijing this week to sanction local government debt refinancing and spending, Chinese markets have declined from an almost one-month high.\n\nEuropean stock futures were less ebullient due to the potential for a global trade war and the threat to EU exports if Trump's tariff policies are implemented. Additionally, there was a possibility that Trump could disengage from NATO, which would necessitate an increase in defence expenditures in Europe and would also serve to strengthen Russia's territorial ambitions. Aside from US political developments, macro events that could potentially impact markets on Wednesday include: Services within the Eurozone Producer prices for September and PMIs for October. September industrial orders in Germany. Services provided by the United States PMI for October.  \n\nOvernight Newswire Updates of Note\n\n * Trump Wins The Critical Battleground State Of Pennsylvania \n * PBoC Affirms Supportive Monetary Policy\n * Japan PM Ishiba Preps Meeting With Biden, China’s XI\n * Japan PMI, Confidence Shrinks On Softer Sales\n * UBS Pushes Back RBA First Rate Cut Forecast To May 2025\n * NZ Unemployment Rate Rises Less Than Forecast\n * Hong Kong Stocks Slide, Traders Pare Risky Bets\n * US Stock, Yields Rise As Markets Await Election Outcome\n * Nvidia Rides AI Wave Past Apple As World largest Company\n * Crypto Surge To Record Levels On Early Trump Lead\n * Spike In UK Borrowing Cost Wipes Out Fiscal Headroom\n *           (Sourced from reliable financial news outlets)\n\n \n\nFX Options Expiries For 10am New York Cut \n\n(1BLN+ represents larger expiries, more magnetic when trading within daily ATR)\n\n * EUR/USD: 1.0650 (3.9BLN), 1.0700 (686M), 1.0725 (1.5BLN)\n * 1.0750 (900M) 1.0800 (2.4BLN)\n * USD/CHF: 0.8675 (241M), 0.8700 (1.4BLN), 0.8800 (289M)\n * EUR/GBP: 0.8390-0.8400 (621M)\n * GBP/USD: 1.3000 (331M)\n * AUD/USD: 0.6475 (689M), 0.6510 (728M), 0.6525 (817M)\n * AUD/NZD: 1.1010 (397M), 1.1100 (300M)\n * USD/CAD: 1.3800 (555M), 1.3875 (420M), 1.4025 (267M), 1.4050 (442M)\n * USD/JPY: 153.50 (728M), 155.65 (350M)  \n\nCFTC Data As Of 1/11/24\n\n * Net USD G10 long +$8.88bn to +$18.7bn in Oct 23-29 IMM period; $IDX +0.13%\n * EUR +0.17%: speculative positions decreased by 21.8k contracts, now at -50.3k, lower ECB view weighs on EUR\n * JPY +1.55%; speculative positions decreased by 37.6k contracts, now at +25k, on hawkish Fed, less dovish BoJ\n * GBP +0.27%; speculative positions decreased by 8.2k contracts, now at +66.4k; less-dovish BoE lends support.

Title: Technical Analysis: Shanghai Datun Energy's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into Shanghai Datun Energy Resources Co Ltd (SDE) may be scratching their heads after the latest quarterly numbers were released without any recent news updates. Despite this lack of fresh information, we can still analyze the company's performance based on its historical data to identify potential trends and patterns. Priced at 10.65 CNH as of yesterday's closing bell, SDE has been trading within a relatively narrow range over the past few months. However, there have been some notable milestones that could impact investment decisions. On February 22nd, the stock reached its 52-week high of 16.44 CNH before retreating to a 52-week low of 10.61 CNH just nine days later on September 10th. This volatility suggests that investors may want to exercise caution when considering a position in SDE. One positive aspect of SDE's performance is its strong Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 30.22, indicating that the company's shares are undervalued compared to its earnings. Additionally, the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 0.6059 suggests that the company's shares are reasonably priced relative to its assets. These ratios suggest that SDE may be an attractive investment opportunity for those willing to take on some risk. However, other technical indicators tell a different story. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 47.85, which indicates that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting a neutral stance. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows that the stock is trading below its 26-day exponential moving average (EMA), which could indicate a downward trend. In conclusion, while Shanghai Datun Energy Resources Co Ltd has shown promise with its P/E and P/B ratios, other technical indicators suggest that the stock may be experiencing a downturn. Investors should carefully consider these factors before making any investment decisions regarding SDE.\n\n- Shanghai Smi (600649.SS) traded up 1.94 % and now trades at CNH 3.25. Shanghai Smi has a market capitalisation of CNH 7.8 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Shanghai Smi is 263.07.\n\n- Fesco (600861.SS) traded down -2.23 % and now trades at CNH 13.67. Current market capitalisation for Fesco is CNH 7.8 bn. Fesco has a current price to earnings ratio of 11.07. Title: FESCO Group Co Ltd's Delayed Annual Report Raises Investor Concerns In a recent development, Future Energy Source Company Limited (FESCO), a leading player in the renewable energy sector, has faced yet another delay in releasing its annual report for the year ended March 31, 2024. This latest setback has raised concerns among investors who have been eagerly awaiting the report to gain insights into the company's financial performance and future prospects. According to sources, the delayed report is likely to be released by the end of September 2024, which marks a significant departure from the original deadline of August 30, 2024. While the reason behind this delay remains unclear, industry experts speculate that it may be due to internal issues or complexities related to the company's financial statements. Despite these challenges, FESCO's stock performance has remained relatively stable over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing price, the company's shares were trading at 13.72 Chinese Yuan (CNH), down from its 52-week high of 25.6 CNH recorded on September 25, 2023. However, the stock has seen a significant drop from its 52-week low of 13.22 CNH on August 26, 2024. From a technical perspective, FESCO's current price of 13.72 CNH represents a discount of approximately 45% compared to its 52-week high. This presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors looking to capitalize on the company's potential for growth in the renewable energy sector. Moreover, the stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.21 and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.27 indicate undervaluation, suggesting that the market may be overlooking the company's strengths and potential for future expansion. In conclusion, while the delayed release of FESCO's annual report may cause temporary uncertainty among investors, the company's fundamentals and long-term growth prospects remain intact. With a strong track record of innovation and a commitment to sustainability, FESCO is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for clean energy solutions. Therefore, savvy investors may view this recent pullback as a buying opportunity ahead of what could be a significant recovery in the company's share price.\n\n- Wuxi Huaguang Environment & Energy (600475.SS) traded down -1.69 % and now trades at CNH 8.3. Wuxi Huaguang Environment & Energy has a market capitalisation of CNH 7.9 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Wuxi Huaguang Environment & Energy is 10.66.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Asian Star Anchor Chain Jiangsu\n\nAsian Star Anchor Chain Co Ltd Jiangsu is a company based in Jingjiang, China that specializes in the manufacturing and selling of anchor chain and offshore mooring chain.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "EUR/USD Extends Recovery But Don't Expect It To Last - Here's WhyNov 26, 2024\n\nImage Source: Pixabay  \n\nThe euro rebounded after an initial drop, as Trump made no immediate tariff threats against eurozone exports. While his warnings appear to be negotiation tactics ahead of his January 20 inauguration, markets remain highly reactive to headlines, creating volatile trading conditions. Despite appointing Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary, Trump’s potential use of executive orders underscores his direct leadership style. The brief cooling of the \"Trump Trade,\" characterised by a strong dollar and Bitcoin rally, may not last. For now, the euro is gaining short-term relief, though the EUR/USD forecast remains modestly bearish.  \n\nOutlook far from ideal for euro\n\nOvernight we saw a big shake up in the FX space as currencies of Mexico, Canada, and China all came under pressure. Only one man could cause such a stir, and it was no other than President-elect Donald Trump, who threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada unless they step up border security against illegal immigration, and to curb Fentanyl inflows from China. Relieved that there were no immediate mentions against eurozone exports, the euro managed to bounce back after a quick drop. While this move appears to be a negotiation tactic from Trump ahead of his January 20 inauguration, the market will increasingly become headline-driven and make for tricky trading conditions. Still, despite appointing a perceived safe pair of hands in Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary, one should not take lightly Trump’s verbal warnings as he could use executive orders to pass them through law. Indeed, if you recall from my note on Monday, I warned that Trump will be the ultimate boss and will lead from the front. And overnight he did really remind us who the boss was. Therefore, the slight cooling of the so-called \"Trump Trade,\" i.e., with a strong dollar cooling as we have seen thus far in the week (except against CAD and CNH that were hit by Trump’s tariff threat overnight), may not last long. But today, the euro is finding itself on the front foot amid the relief bounce that commenced from end of last week from severely technical oversold levels. While the recovery may end up lasting for a while, the EUR/USD outlook remains modestly bearish.  \n\nEuro rebound could be short-lived \n\nThis week, we haven’t got much in the way of Eurozone date. On Monday, the German Ifo Business Climate survey offered new insights into business sentiment. Following last week’s weak PMI data, a positive surprise seemed unlikely, and the results confirmed this. The survey came in at 85.7, below both the previous 86.5 and expectations of 86.1.\n\nThe euro’s recent struggles underscore investor concerns about the economic outlook in the Eurozone and China, as well as trade uncertainties in 2025 following Trump’s US election victory.\n\nTraders are closely monitoring eurozone data for improvement, but without positive signs, the euro may remain under pressure despite a strong start to the week. Last week’s composite PMI fell from 50 to 48.1, indicating contraction, with both services and manufacturing slowing. Weak export demand and declining business sentiment add to the gloom. While third-quarter GDP showed growth, fourth-quarter stagnation now appears likely, reinforcing a bearish euro sentiment.  \n\nWhat about US dollar and data? \n\nWhile it may have lost some momentum, the dollar has been on a strong bullish trend until the start of this week. But it is by no means it is the end of the bullish trend. Traders have been betting on Trump’s fiscal policies, including sweeping trade tariffs and measures to boost economic growth. The dollar index had risen for eight straight weeks through Friday. The momentum is thus quite strong and so this dollar weakness may prove to be short-lived, preventing the EUR/USD from turning bullish just yet.\n\nThis is a shortened week due to Thanksgiving. Today’s data highlights on the US economic calendar include CB Consumer Confidence (expected to show an improvement to 111.8 from 108.7 last), New Home Sales, Richmond Manufacturing Index and FOMC minutes. On Wednesday, ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, the US will release a flurry of data, including the second estimate of Q3 GDP, core PCE inflation, unemployment claims and durable goods orders.\n\nThese reports could significantly influence the short-term EUR/USD direction, but it may not have any long-term impact as everyone is focused on what Trump will mean for the dollar next year. With many investors likely stepping away for the long holiday weekend, Friday could be a quieter day.    \n\nEUR/USD technical analysis and key levels to watch\n\nSource: TradingView.com\n\nThe fact that the EUR/USD has so far refused to hold below last year’s low of 1.0448 is a modestly positive sign, if it can hang around these levels. But the series of lower lows and lower highs should remind you that we that we have seen such recovery attempts only to be engulfed frequently by even sharper sell-off periods. Thus, without a solid technical evidence that rates have bottomed out, we could be in another such environment: corrective phase inside a larger bear trend. The EUR/USD is therefore far from bullish from a purely technical point of view, just yet.\n\nIf the EUR/USD manages to build a base now around the 1.0450-1.0500 area (shaded in grey on the chart), then we may see it climb back towards the next resistance at 1.0600, and even higher towards the more significant hurdle around 1.0700 area. But if it goes back below that 1.0450-1.0500 area, then for me that would be the clearest indication yet that traders want to see even lower levels such as 1.0300, 1.0200 and so on.\n\nMore By This Author:\n\nGold Drops On Bessent Appointment But Bears Face Lots Of Hurdles S&P 500 At Pivotal Zone EUR/USD Under Pressure From Multiple Sources But Clings On To $1.05 For Now"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

However, that's rarely the case and while\nthe disparity allows option markets to trade any offset between\nimplied and realised volatility, levels of implied volatility\ncan provide an FX bellwether for the broader FX market. \n    When implied volatility is low it highlights expectations of\nlow realised volatility, often within familiar ranges and\nagainst a backdrop of strong risk appetite. These are the\nperfect conditions for carry trades that benefit those holding\nhigher yielding currencies and being short of lower yielding\ncurrencies, as it will reassure investors that there's less\nperceived risk of any adverse currency moves that could erase\ntheir profits. \n       \n    For more click on [FXBUZ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n1-month expiry FXO implied volatility    https://tmsnrt.rs/3LgM9Cu\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Richard Pace is a Reuters market analyst.

As of September 16th, 2024, FSC closed at 6.85 Chinese Yuan (CNH), just slightly below its 52-week high of 10.24 CNH reached on November 9th, 2023. This indicates that the stock has been trading within a relatively narrow range, suggesting stability in the company's financial performance. Looking back at the previous quarterly results, FSC reported a solid balance sheet with a price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) of 27.36 and a price to book ratio (P/B Ratio) of 1.21, according to the latest available data from finanzen.net. These ratios indicate that FSC's shares are currently undervalued compared to its earnings and book value, which could be an attractive entry point for potential investors. While there have been no recent updates on FSC's financial performance or business developments, the company's historical track record suggests a stable financial foundation. With a strong balance sheet and a proven ability to maintain a consistent share price, FSC may be worth considering for long-term investment strategies. However, it is important to note that the absence of recent news may also indicate a lack of significant changes or developments within the company. As such, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. Nonetheless, for those seeking stable financial performance and undervalued shares, FSC may present an intriguing opportunity.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Orient Securities -China (600958.SS) traded up 0.71 % and now trades at HKD 8.55.

As of September 11th, 2024, the stock closed at 4.4 Hong Kong dollars (HKD), just shy of its 52-week high of 5.23 HKD reached on July 2nd, 2024.

Despite the lack of recent news, investors may be encouraged by the positive trend in CHCJY's stock price. However, it is important to note that the banking sector is highly sensitive to economic conditions and geopolitical events, so any unexpected changes could impact the stock's performance. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Tbea (600089.SS) traded up 1.01 % and now trades at CNH 12.08. Current market capitalisation for Tbea is CNH 60.5 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Tbea is 8.02. Title: TBEA's Latest Launch Fails to Boost Stock Price Despite Strong Fundamentals In a recent development, TBEA Co Ltd (TBEA) has launched a new 1,500V string inverter, marking another milestone in the company's innovation journey. However, despite this positive move, the stock price has failed to respond, remaining stagnant in recent times. As of now, the last closing price of TBEA stands at 12.43 CNY, down from its 52-week high of 16.76 CNY recorded on March 5th, 2024. Despite the lackluster performance in the stock market, TBEA's fundamentals remain strong. The company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) currently stands at 8.22792, indicating that investors are willing to pay 8.23 times the company's earnings per share. Additionally, the price-to-book ratio (P/B Ratio) is 1.09479, suggesting that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. From a technical standpoint, TBEA's stock has been trading within a narrow range between 12.06 CNY (52-week low) and 16.76 CNY (52-week high). The stock has been consolidating below the 50-day moving average (MA), which could be an indication of weakness in the short term. However, the relative strength index (RSI) remains above 50, implying that the stock is still in a bullish territory. If the stock breaks out above the 50-day MA, it could trigger a rally towards the 52-week high of 16.76 CNY. On the other hand, a breakdown below the 12.06 CNY support level could lead to a decline towards the next support level at 10.44 CNY. Conclusion: While TBEA's latest launch has failed to boost the stock price, the company's strong fundamentals suggest that there may be value in investing in the long run. Technically speaking, the stock is trading within a tight range, and a breakout or breakdown could determine the near-term direction. Therefore, investors should keep a close eye on TBEA's movements and consider entering into a long position if the stock breaks out above the 50-day MA.\n\n- Ningbo Deye (605117.SS) traded down -0.6 % and now trades at CNY 92.4. Ningbo Deye has a market capitalisation of CNY 60.4 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Ningbo Deye is 32.13. Title: Ningbo Deye Technology: Technical Analysis Paints Mixed Picture Investors looking to gain exposure to China's booming technology sector may want to take a closer look at Ningbo Deye Technology Co Ltd (NDTC), but a technical analysis of the company's assets paints a mixed picture. According to data from Finanzen.net, the last known news on NDTC dates back to August 28th, with the stock closing at 85.88 CNH. While this may suggest a lack of recent activity, the company's performance over the past year tells a different story. On July 24th, NDTC reached a 52-week high of 104.79 CNH, representing a significant increase from its 52-week low of 39.65 CNH on December 12th, 2023. This volatility has resulted in a price to earnings ratio of 29.94 and a price to book ratio of 7.21, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for the company's growth potential. However, the stock's current price of 85.88 CNH represents a decline from its previous close, raising concerns about the company's short-term prospects. Additionally, the lack of recent news may indicate a lack of momentum or interest in the company, which could impact its future performance. Despite these mixed signals, NDTC remains an attractive option for investors seeking exposure to China's tech industry. With a strong track record of growth and a solid balance sheet, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging trends and technologies. However, investors should exercise caution and closely monitor developments before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank (601825.SS) traded up 1.06 % and now trades at CNH 6.87.

In between, the company\nfrequently tapped the private placement market, mostly for short tenors and\njust a few 10-year or 30-year trades. \n\nMTR, which requires long term funding due to the nature of its business, came\nto the Dim Sum market after the Hong Kong government in July and Temasek\nHoldings in August both issued sizeable 10-year and 30-year bonds on the back\nof large order books.\n\n“Like all sophisticated issuers, they have been monitoring all the markets\nregularly, including US dollars, Hong Kong dollars and renminbi, while AAHK,\nthe Hong Kong government, Temasek, Swire and Prologis all had good response\nfrom the market, which gives all potential CNH issuers confidence in the depth\nof the Dim Sum market, especially the long end,\" said David Yim, head of debt\ncapital markets for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered. \n\nHaving come to the view that the Dim Sum market would be able to accommodate\nboth the tenor and the size it wanted, and offered the lowest absolute yield\namong the three currencies, MTR announced the deal on Monday.\n\nIt priced a Rmb3bn 10-year at par to yield 2.75% and a Rmb1.5bn 30-year at par\nto yield 3.05%, inside respective initial price guidance of 3.1% area and 3.4%\narea.\n\n\"The market for CNH is developing rapidly. The 30-year market has opened up\nclearly and meaningfully,\" said another banker on the deal.\n\nMTR also aimed to promote the green angle by tapping the public market. The\nbanker said the issuer had done green private deals before, but the leads\nrecommended a public deal for greater publicity. \n\nThere was uncertainty initially about the market response to a 30-year tenor,\nso the issuer put the focus on the 10-year tranche when it announced the\nmandate on Monday and said the 30-year would be dependent on reverse\nenquiries, in order to approach the deal \"step by step\", said the banker. \n\n\"The 10-year market is more established ... but the 30-year is a new market,\nsmaller but growing, so we wanted to get the right feedback,\" he said. \n\nInvestors showed strong interest for the 30-year tranche during the calls on\nMonday, convincing the leads to give them certainty and do a proper\nbookbuilding on the second day instead of reverse enquiries.  \n\nWith onshore yields compressed, many investors from mainland China are chasing\nafter higher yields in the offshore market. Bank treasuries, which used to be\nmore comfortable with short tenors, are now participating in 10-year notes,\nand with banks building good foundations for that tenor, funds have followed\ninto the 30-year space, which also attracts interest from insurers and\nofficial institutions. Even private banks joined MTR's 30-year tranche.  \n\n“We were pleasantly surprised so many investors participated … In the\nfast-developing CNH market, especially for tenors beyond 10 years, investors\nsimply don’t want to miss out any high quality, highly rated names,\" said\nYim.\n\nOrders for the 10-year tranche reached Rmb11.2bn, including Rmb3.06bn from the\nleads, from 95 accounts. Asia took 89% and EMEA 11%. Asset and fund managers\nand insurers accounted for 39%, banks 27%, official institutions and sovereign\nwealth funds 23%, and private banks and securities houses 11%. \n\nOrders for the 30-year bonds reached Rmb8.7bn, including Rmb1.37bn from the\nleads, from 85 Asian accounts. Asset and fund managers and insurers took 62%,\nbanks 3%, official institutions and sovereign wealth funds 20%, and private\nbanks and securities houses 15%. \n\nThe Hong Kong government's 2.7% 10-year and 3.15% 30-year bonds were used as\nthe main comparables, with the leads also taking into consideration Temasek's\n2.75% 10-year and 3.1% 30-year bonds and Airport Authority Hong Kong's 2.93%\n10-year. \n\nHong Kong's 10-year notes were trading at 2.75%, where MTR's 10-year trade\npriced. The leads estimated a 0bp–5bp negative new issue premium considering\nthe curve extension. Pricing for the 30-year tranche was derived from the\nspread difference between the two tenors seen on the issues from the Hong Kong\ngovernment and Temasek, which was between 30bp and 35bp, leading to the final\npricing of 3.05%. \n\nThe 10-year bonds traded up by 40 cents in the secondary market on Wednesday\nafternoon, and the 30-year was up 25 cents.\n\nThe issuer is rated Aa3/AA+ (Moody's/S&P) and the Reg S bonds will be rated\nAA+ (S&P). \n\nBank of China (Hong Kong), Credit Agricole, HSBC, Mizuho and Standard\nChartered were the global coordinators. They were also the lead managers and\nbookrunners with ANZ, Barclays, BNP Paribas, DBS Bank, Deutsche Bank, ICBC\n(Asia), JP Morgan, MUFG, OCBC, SMBC Nikko, and Societe Generale. \n\nProceeds will be used to refinance eligible investments in line with the\nissuer's sustainable finance framework.\n\n(Reporting by Pan Yue; Editing by Vincent Baby and Daniel Stanton)\n\n((yue.pan@lseg.com))\n\nStory Id: 4820374\n\n\n\nCopyright © LSEG 2024.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "(Repeats column published on Thursday with no changes)\n    By Jamie McGeever\n       ORLANDO, Florida, Sept 26 (Reuters) - It's safe to say\nthat the timing and scale of the stimulus measures unleashed by\nChina this week were, in large part, prompted by the U.S.\nFederal Reserve's jumbo-sized interest rate cut only a few days\nbefore.\n    But unfortunately for Chinese policymakers, the U.S. central\nbank's apparent commitment to an aggressive easing campaign –\nand the impact this could have on the exchange rate between the\nyuan and the dollar – could put Beijing in a serious bind. \n    On the face of it, the yuan's substantial appreciation\nagainst the dollar in the two months to Monday was baffling.\nWhile an increasingly gloomy domestic economic outlook slammed\nChinese stocks and bond yields lower, the yuan powered to a\n16-month high.\n    And then the yuan got another boost this week, as Beijing\nrolled out a series of liquidity, monetary and fiscal stimulus\nmeasures running into the trillions of yuan. The offshore yuan\nhas scaled the 7.00 per dollar barrier for the first time since\nJanuary 2023.\n    \n    \n    This latest whoosh makes more sense. Investors are betting\nthat Beijing is finally taking the serious measures required to\nrevive growth. It's notable that the yuan's rally this week has\nbeen accompanied by surging stocks and higher bond yields.\n    In the long run, a strong currency is good news for China.\nIt will boost foreign investor sentiment and attract capital\ninflows while raising China's nominal dollar-denominated GDP – a\nmetric Beijing will need to be keenly focused on if it ever\nwants to truly rival or even surpass the U.S. \n    On that note, China's nominal annual GDP growth rate right\nnow is lower than that of Japan and the U.S., something few\nwould have predicted only a few years ago.\n    But the short-term picture is more complicated. With growth\ncratering and deflationary forces intensifying, the last thing\nChina's economy needs is a strong exchange rate. Policymakers\nwill welcome the renewed optimism around China, but not the\nstrong currency that generates.\n    Stephen Jen, co-founder of hedge fund Eurizon SLJ and\nlong-time China watcher, thinks Beijing is stuck between a rock\nand a hard place. As the Fed's easing cycle rolls on, the\ndollar's floor against the yuan will almost certainly drop.\n    \"I continue to believe USD/CNY is heading lower, possibly by\n10% in the coming year. Almost everyone is the wrong way\naround. Positioning adjustment will make this prospective\ndecline non-linear,\" he wrote on Wednesday.\n    \n    LIMITED OPTIONS\n    The People's Bank of China is obviously powerless to stop\nthe Fed from slashing U.S. rates. So if the PBOC wants to\nprevent an overvaluation of the yuan, it could either lower\nChina's various lending rates or initiate a bond-buying, or\n'quantitative easing,' program.\n    But it has limited scope to do the former, and even less\ndesire to do the latter. That being the case, it could use one\nother tool to keep the exchange rate from overheating: buying\ndollars. \n    This plan involves high political risk, though. China and\nthe United States are in a trade war that has escalated\nmeaningfully in recent years. This has deepened the political\ndivide between the two superpowers, which is partly why China\nhas reduced its holdings of U.S. Treasuries. \n    \n    \n    China's official stash of U.S. Treasuries has fallen 30%\nfrom a post-pandemic peak of $1.1 trillion in early 2021. Its\noverall holdings of dollar-denominated assets have not shrunk\nanywhere near as much, but the direction of travel is clear.\nRamping up purchases of America's currency and government debt\nwould likely be a difficult sell for Beijing domestically.\n    What's more, the incoming U.S. presidential administration,\nwhether it be headed by Kamala Harris or Donald Trump, would\nalmost certainly baulk at what it would surely allege to be\ncurrency manipulation. Retaliatory action, perhaps in the form\nof even more punitive tariffs, would likely follow.\n    In other words, Beijing can no longer consider bursts of FX\nintervention a reliable default strategy. \n    So even though the steps taken this week may have gotten\nChina back on the path to a long-term recovery, its currency\nconundrum could ensure the road is rocky in the short term.\n    (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a\ncolumnist for Reuters.)\n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nChina's U.S. Treasuries Holdings    https://tmsnrt.rs/47Jczr9\nOffshore yuan strengthens through 7.00 per dollar    https://tmsnrt.rs/3XUH4Hd\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (By Jamie McGeever; Editing by Andrea Ricci)\n ((jamie.mcgeever@thomsonreuters.com; Reuters Messaging:\njamie.mcgeever.reuters.com@reuters.net))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

The weekly jobless claims data was skewed by Hurricane Helene. Next week's data will be affected by Hurricane Milton.\n    Moves were fairly muted across major currencies. The euro was flat at $1.10938 <EUR=EBS>, the pound was up 0.08% at $1.3071 <GBP=D3>, while the dollar was up 0.34% against the Japanese yen at 149.11 <JPY=EBS>. \nAs a result, the dollar index <=USD> was flat at 102.89, taking a breather after a recent steady climb that took it above 103 on Thursday, its highest since mid-August on the back of traders reducing bets on further jumbo interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve at its remaining meetings this year. \n    \"The market is satisfied because there's nothing there that really tells against the narrative that the Fed is cutting; the only debate is how fast they're going to cut,\" said Steven Englander, head of Global G10 FX Research at Standard Chartered in New York.\n    \"Overall, the data have been slightly encouraging to that narrative and none of the data have been discouraging to the narrative that the Fed is cutting rates.\"\n    Britain's economy grew in August after two consecutive months of stagnation, providing some relief to finance minister Rachel Reeves ahead of the new Labour government's first budget later this month.\n    However, in addition to being broadly steady on the dollar the pound was little changed on the euro at 83.67 pence to the common currency. <EURGBP=D3> \nTraders are also watching French politics, after the government on Thursday delivered its 2025 budget with plans for 60 billion euros ($65.5 billion) worth of spending cuts and tax hikes on the wealthy and big companies to tackle a soaring fiscal deficit. \n    The budget is unlikely to pass until December, as French Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his allies in President Emmanuel Macron's camp lack a majority by a sizeable margin and will have little choice but to accept numerous concessions. \nMarkets are also awaiting a news conference from China's finance ministry on fiscal policy on Saturday. The Chinese yuan <CNH=> strengthened 0.17% against the greenback to 7.071 per dollar.\nThe Australian dollar <AUD=D3> strengthened 0.04% versus the greenback to $0.6742, while the New Zealand dollar <NZD=D3> was at $0.61 after the central bank on Wednesday slashed rates by a half point and hinted at further cuts to come.\n    In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin <BTC=> gained 3.43% to $61,771.00. Ethereum <ETH=> rose 2.74% to $2,431.10.\n     \n     \n Currency bid                                               \n prices at 11                                              \n October​ 02:21                                            \n p.m. GMT                                                  \n Description         RIC  Las  U.S. Close   Pct   YT  Hig  Low\n                          t    Previous     Chan  D   h    Bid\n                               Session      ge    Pc  Bid  \n                                                  t        \n Dollar index        <=U  102  102.89       -0.0  1.  102  102\n                     SD>  .82               6%    43  .99  .76\n                                                  %        \n Euro/Dollar         <EU  1.0  1.0938       0.08  -0  $1.  $1.\n                     R=E  946               %     .8  095  092\n                     BS>                          3%  3    7\n Dollar/Yen          <JP  149  148.58       0.39  5.  149  148\n                     Y=D  .15               %     76  .25  .51\n                     3>                           %        \n Euro/Yen            <EU  1.0  162.48       0.49  4.  163  162\n                     RJP  946               %     91  .29  .32\n                     Y=>  ​                       %        \n Dollar/Swiss        <CH  0.8  0.8563       0.15  1.  0.8  0.8\n                     F=E  573               %     9%  585  56\n                     BS>                                   \n Sterling/Dollar     <GB  1.3  1.3061       0.11  2.  $1.  $1.\n                     P=D  075               %     75  308  304\n                     3>                           %   2    2​\n Dollar/Canadian     <CA  1.3  1.3742       0.02  3.  1.3  1.3\n                     D=D  743               %     69  785  726\n                     3>                           %        \n Aussie/Dollar       <AU  0.6  0.6742       0.11  -1  $0.  $0.\n                     D=D  749               %     %   675  672\n                     3>                                    6\n Euro/Swiss          <EU  0.9  0.9364       0.19  1.  0.9  0.9\n                     RCH  382               %     03  387  363\n                     F=>                          %        \n Euro/Sterling       <EU  0.8  0.8373       -0.0  -3  0.8  0.8\n                     RGB  371               2%    .4  383  365\n                     P=>                          5%       \n NZ Dollar/Dollar    <NZ  0.6  0.6095       0.12  -3  $0.  0.6\n                     D=D  102               %     .4  610  072\n                     3>                           3%  7    \n Dollar/Norway       <NO  10.  10.7222      -0.2  5.  10.  10.\n                     K=>  695               5%    53  763  695\n                          3​                      %   7    9\n Euro/Norway         <EU  11.  11.7412      -0.2  4.  11.  11.\n                     RNO  707               9%    31  772  705\n                     K=>  6                       %        5\n Dollar/Sweden       <SE  10.  10.3744      -0.1  2.  10.  10.\n                     K=>  359               4%    91  415  360\n                          8                       %   7    1\n Euro/Sweden         <EU  11.  11.3617      -0.1  1.  11.  11.\n                     RSE  340               9%    93  388  341\n                     K=>  4                       %   3    \n     \n     \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates    https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York and Alun John in London; Editiing by Kim Coghill, Andrew Heavens and Jonathan Oatis)\n((mailto:Chibuike.Oguh@thomsonreuters.com; +332-219-1834; Reuters Messaging: rm://chibuike.oguh.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net/))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

Against the yen, the\ndollar fell 2.3% to 143.13, close to the weakest level for the\nyear.\n  \n        Weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data, along with\ndisappointing earnings reports from large technology firms and\nheightened concerns over the Chinese economy, have sparked a\nglobal sell-off in stocks, oil and high-yielding currencies in\nthe past week as investors sought the safety of cash.\n    The selling continued on Monday, with U.S. Treasury yields\nfalling further, stock indexes in the red, bitcoin <BTC=> dumped\nand the dollar losing ground.\n    \"As traders continue to pile into bets that the Fed is going\nto ease a very large amount more this year than thought even as\nrecently as Wednesday, USD is taking a bit of a beating with a\ncouple notable exceptions,\" Helen Given, FX trader at Monex USA\nin Washington, said.\n        \"Friday's NFP report was a bit of a shock to the global\nsystem and markets are very worried that the US may no longer be\na viable driver of global growth,\" she said.\n  \n        Treasury yields have been falling sharply since last\nweek, when the Federal Reserve kept the policy rate in its\ncurrent 5.25% to 5.50% range while Chair Jerome Powell opened\nthe possibility of a rate cut in September.\n  \n        But by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate\nhad jumped, expectations for rate cuts rose.\n  \n        The Japanese yen's surge comes as traders aggressively\nunwound carry trades. So-called carry trades, where investors\nborrow in money from economies with low interest rates such as\nJapan or Switzerland to fund investments in higher-yielding\nassets elsewhere, have been popular in recent years.\n  \n        On Monday, Fed fund futures reflected traders pricing a\nnear 100% chance of a 50 basis point cut at the central bank's\nSeptember meeting, according to CME FedWatch. Futures imply 127\nbasis points of cuts this year, LSEG data showed.\n  \n        \"The Japanese equity selloff during Asian trading\nspooked markets in a big way, coupled with the Yen's resurgence,\nand we may be seeing the so-called 'panic spiral' that many have\nbeen concerned about,\" Monex's Given said.\n  \n        Meanwhile, the Swiss franc <CHF=EBS>, another popular\ncarry trade funding currency, was about 1% higher at 0.8499 to\nthe dollar. The franc, a traditional safe haven, was also\ntrading at a seven-month high.\n    \"(It) all seems a significant over-reaction to one weak jobs\nreport, particularly when we know that the FOMC shan’t over\nreact from a policy perspective,\" Michael Brown, market analyst\nat Pepperstone in London, said.\n    The dollar found some relief against the British pound as\nthe marked deterioration in global investor risk sentiment\nsapped demand for riskier currencies. \n        The depreciation of \n    Mexico's peso\n     extended into its third day on Monday, and the U.S. dollar\nrose 1.9% to 19.53 pesos, on investor risk aversion. \n  \n        In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin <BTC=> and ether <ETH=>\nplunged on Monday to multi-month lows as investors a rushed out\nof risky assets. Bitcoin was down 14% to $54,078, heading for\nits largest one-day fall since November 2022.

The currency was trading near its strongest\nlevel since early January.\n    The dollar <=USD> dropped 0.5% against major currencies to\ntrade at 102.62 - a near five-month low.  \n    \"Fears of a U.S. recession mean that the market is no longer\nlooking for an orderly adjustment in Fed policy towards some\nkind of neutral rate - say near 3.25%. No, the fear of a\nrecession is now bringing in the idea of stimulative monetary\npolicy,\" noted Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING.\n    \"It is no surprise to see low-yielding currencies now in the\nascendancy as the rest of the world now starts to converge on\ntheir low interest rates.\"\n        The yen has jumped 14% against the dollar over the past\nthree weeks, driven in part by the Bank of Japan's 15-basis\npoints rate rise last week to 0.25%, alongside which it\nannounced a plan to halve its monthly bond purchases over the\nnext couple of years.\n    Barclays analysts said the Japanese currency was the most\noverbought among G10 majors, and therefore \"the bar for yet more\noutperformance in the near term appears high\".\n    The Swiss franc <CHF=EBS>, another popular funding currency,\nwas up more than 1% at 0.84825 to the dollar. The franc, a\ntraditional safe haven, was also trading at a seven-month high. \n    High-yielding currencies such as the Indian rupee <INR=IN>\nand Mexican peso <MXN=> tumbled, while currencies that had\nhitherto been used for funding investments, such as the yen and\nChina's yuan  <CNH=>, rallied strongly.     \n    Treasury yields have been falling quite sharply since last\nweek, when the Federal Reserve kept the policy rate in its\ncurrent 5.25% to 5.50% range while Chair Jerome Powell opened\nthe possibility of a rate cut in September.\n    But by Friday, after data showed the unemployment rate had\njumped, which sparked chatter the U.S. economy could be heading\nfor a recession, expectations for rate cuts deepened.\n    Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries <US10YT=RR> sank nearly 40\nbasis points last week, the largest weekly fall since March\n2020, and were last at 3.75%.\n    Fed fund futures reflected traders pricing a near 99% chance\nof a 50 basis point cut at the central bank's September meeting,\naccording to LSEG data. Futures imply 127 basis points of cuts\nthis year.\n        The euro was up 0.2% at $1.0954 <EUR=EBS> despite the\nexpectation for interest rate cuts from the European Central\nBank (ECB) surging. Traders now see more than 90 basis points of\nrate cut from the ECB this year, versus 50 bps at the start of\nlast week.  \n    Meanwhile, markets are also dealing with the risk of\nmilitary escalation in the Middle East after latest developments\nin the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which has driven\noil prices <CLc1> to their lowest since January. \n    The U.S. military is deploying more forces in the Middle\nEast and Europe following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas\nand Hezbollah to respond to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail\nHaniyeh last week in Tehran.\n     \n    \n\n    <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nWorld FX rates    https://tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E\nFX moves 10 days    https://tmsnrt.rs/4dpFKRs\nGraphic-US unemployment rate     https://tmsnrt.rs/3piciFu\nGraphic-US inflation and interest rates    https://reut.rs/4fvmDas\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n (Reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore and Sruthi Shankar\nin Bengaluru; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Ros Russell)\n ((Vidya.ranganathan@tr.com))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1"}]}

The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 50.68 on 11/16/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNY 22.04 on 07/09/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Rigol\n\nRigol Technologies Co Ltd: A Technical Analysis Investors looking for a promising technology stock may want to take a closer look at Rigol Technologies Co Ltd (RIGOL), a company that has been making waves in the industry with its innovative products and strong financial performance. Despite a lack of recent news, the company's historical data tells an interesting story. A Look at Historical Prices According to our records, the last known news about Rigol dates back to December 22nd, 2023, when the company donated 10 million yuan to support the digital protection of Mogao Grottoes. However, this generous act did not seem to have much impact on the company's stock price, which has been trending upwards steadily since November 2023. As of September 30th, 2024, the last closing price of Rigol was 29.11 CNY, representing a significant increase from its 52-week low of 22.04 CNY on July 8th, 2024. This growth is even more impressive considering the stock's 52-week high of 50.68 CNY, reached on November 15th, 2023. Technical Indicators Paint a Bullish Picture When analyzing Rigol's technical indicators, we see a bullish pattern emerging. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 68.24, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signal line is above the MACD signal line, suggesting that the stock is likely to continue its upward trend. Valuation Metrics Offer Insights Looking at Rigol's valuation metrics, we can see that the company's Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 78.24, which is significantly higher than the industry average. Similarly, the Price to Book (P/B) ratio of 2.00722 indicates that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its peers. Outlook and Recommendations While there is no recent news to speak of, Rigol's historical data paints a picture of a financially healthy and technically strong company. With a bullish technical outlook and premium valuation, investors may want to consider taking a position in Rigol for long-term gains. However, it is important to keep an eye on any future developments or announcements that could impact the stock's performance.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion (603583.SS) traded up 9.2 % and now trades at CNY 19.1. Current market capitalisation for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is CNY 6.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion is 18.89. Title: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Aba Chemicals (300261.SZ) traded up 15.59 % and now trades at CNY 6.97. Aba Chemicals has a market capitalisation of CNY 6.7 bn.\n\n- Cgn Nuclear Development (000881.SZ) traded up 7.42 % and now trades at CNY 7.09. Cgn Nuclear Development has a market capitalisation of CNY 6.7 bn.\n\n- Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made (605555.SS) traded up 9.96 % and now trades at CNY 19.76.

Title: Technical Analysis: Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made Co Ltd (NDEM) may be scratching their heads after reviewing the company's latest financial data. While there have been no recent news updates on the company, a closer look at the numbers reveals some interesting trends. Firstly, let's take a glance at the stock's price movement over the past year. As of September 17th, 2024, the closing price of NDEM stands at 15.85 CNH, which represents a significant drop from its 52-week high of 25.77 CNH recorded on November 19th, 2023. However, this decline has not deterred investors entirely, as the stock still maintains a respectable 52-week low of 13.31 CNH on February 5th, 2024. When examining the company's valuation ratios, we see that the Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 16.79, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 16 times the company's earnings per share. Meanwhile, the Price to Book (P/B) ratio sits at 2.14, suggesting that the market values each dollar of NDEM's book value at around 2.14 dollars. While these ratios might seem attractive to potential investors, they do not tell the whole story. The lack of recent news updates could indicate either a stable or struggling company, depending on one's perspective. Moreover, the mixed signals from the stock's price movements and valuation ratios suggest that investors should exercise caution before making any investment decisions. In conclusion, while Ningbo Dechang Electrical Machinery Made Co Ltd presents an intriguing opportunity for investors, further research and analysis are necessary to fully understand the company's current situation and future prospects. As such, investors are advised to keep a watchful eye on upcoming developments and news updates before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Bear Electric Appliance (002959.SZ) traded up 10.01 % and now trades at CNY 47.48.

This represents a modest increase from the 52-week low of 2.13 HKD recorded on January 21st, but a slight decrease from the 52-week high of 2.64 HKD reached on May 19th. Technical Analysis Indicates Mixed Signals From a technical standpoint, the stock's price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) stands at 3.39, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately three times the company's earnings per share for each dollar of net income. Meanwhile, the price to book ratio (P/B Ratio) is 0.29892, suggesting that the market values the company's assets at roughly 30% above their book value.

However, without more recent news or developments, it is difficult to accurately assess the company's prospects. In conclusion, while there have been no significant updates on China Everbright Bank in recent days, the company's steady growth and stable financial fundamentals suggest that it remains a solid long-term investment opportunity. Nevertheless, investors should continue to monitor the company's progress and any changes in the broader economic landscape before making any investment decisions.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Bank Of Beijing\n\nThe Bank of Beijing Co., Ltd. is a commercial bank operating in China's capital city, Beijing.

The new head of LCH's foreign exchange clearing service has said the involvement of more banks and buy-side firms coupled with new currency pairs should accelerate the recent growth in ForexClear's options markets.\n\nSpeaking to FOW, LCH's new head of ForexClear Andrew Batchelor reflected on the firm's recent spike in FX options activity, with average daily volume up 81% last month to $16 billion (?12.6bn).\n\nVolume for the first three weeks of June is running at what would be a monthly record of $21 billion, compared to $10 billion in June 2023, while June 27 marked a record $48 billion of FX options notional cleared on a single day.\n\n\"The overall 100% year-on-year growth in ADV demonstrates the strong demand for clearing, and with the thirteenth large bank joining in June, we expect this upward trend to continue,\" Batchelor said in an interview. \"We believe there is considerable upside from here as we go through the work of extending tenors, adding currency pairs and enhancing connectivity with the other banks.\n\n\"As we expand the offering to include USD/CAD or USD/CNH FX Options, which is planned for the end of 2025, those regional and international banks that have exposures will be very attracted by the benefits of clearing.\"\n\nOverall, ForexClear cleared $2.9 trillion of contracts in May, a 45% year-on-year increase as non-deliverable forwards (NDFs), client clearing and options have all seen gains on last year partly due to regulatory capital charges on bank's over-the-counter derivatives books, said Batchelor, who was this month promoted to head of ForexClear from his former role of chief operating officer.\n\n\"Our biggest bank members have been quite deliberate and robust in deploying their clearing strategies, and you can see that in the volume growth across ForexClear,\" he added. \"Even in NDFs, which is a relatively mature market for us, our ADV was up 40% year-on-year in May, to $130 billion. We are one of the largest NDF counterparties in the market, and that is driven primarily by bank flows as they clear more of their book.\n\n\"Two large banks have recently joined as members in June 2024 and we are seeing more buy-side clients joining as well. As the volumes grow, the portfolio effect generates benefits from clearing other products such as FX Options and FX Forwards.\" LCH ForexClear did not disclose the names of the banks.\n\nThere are currently 84 clients and 41 member entities live on LCH ForexClear, with seven new clients joining this year, according to figures provided by the firm. ForexClear in November 2023 launched its \"smart clearing\" service in partnership with LSEG-owned Quantile to enable optimised clearing and compression of FX forwards.\n\n\"FX Smart Clearing has been additive to that,\" Batchelor said. \"If you have a big pool of risk in the clearing house and are benefiting from netting and cross margining, there are material capital benefits which can be generated from clearing FX Forwards, without increasing initial margin. The two things work hand-in-hand.\n\n\"We have six banks that are live on Smart Clearing and expect to add more later this year. In the coming months, the technological and operational processes will be further enhanced and will further attract additional participants.\"\n\nBuy-side firms are switching to listed and cleared derivatives from bank-dominated over-the-counter (OTC) products, generating interest in the smaller listed FX options market, an executive at Eurex said in May.\n\nCME Group said last month futures markets have become a \"meaningful\" tool for price discovery, as the US exchange prepares to roll-out a new pricing functionality for spot markets derived from its listed venues."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

The central bank's\ndaily benchmark fixings and support from state-owned banks have\nslowed its decline. \n    The currency hit a five-month low of 7.2422 on Tuesday, and\nis down roughly 2% this year, pressured by its relative low\nyields versus other currencies and outflows of foreign\ninvestment from an anaemic stock market. \n    Top U.S. central bank officials including Powell backed away\non Tuesday from providing any guidance on when interest rates\nmay be cut, saying instead that monetary policy needs to be\nrestrictive for longer. That further dashed investor hopes for\nsignificant easing this year and put pressure on Asian\ncurrencies. \n    The People's Bank of China set the midpoint rate <CNY=PBOC>,\naround which the yuan is allowed to trade in a 2% band, at\n7.1025 per U.S. dollar prior to market open, firmer than the\nprevious fix 7.1028. \n    An elevated strengthening bias implied by the daily fixing\nrate points to a desire to limit the pace of currency\ndepreciation from the PBOC, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a\nnote, adding that USD/CNY remains \"in a tug-of-war between\ndepreciation pressures and policy controls\". \n    China reported better-than-expected economic growth in the\nfirst quarter on Tuesday. \n    The improving economic conditions leaves room for the\ncentral bank to keep its policy rate on hold in the near term,\nDBS analysts said in a note.\n    In the spot market, the spot yuan <CNY=CFXS> opened at\n7.2360 per dollar and was changing hands at 7.2396 at midday.\nThe offshore yuan <CNH=D3> was trading -0.29% away from the\nonshore spot at 7.2603 per dollar. \n    The global dollar index <=USD> fell to 106.242 from the\nprevious close of 106.257. \n\n\n\n    The yuan market at 3:09AM GMT: \n    \n    ONSHORE SPOT:\n Item                          Current  Previous  Change\n PBOC midpoint <CNY=SAEC>      7.1025   7.1028    0.00%\n Spot yuan <CNY=CFXS>          7.2396   7.238     -0.02%\n Divergence from midpoint*     1.93%              \n Spot change YTD                                  -1.96%\n Spot change since 2005 revaluation               14.32%\n    \n*Divergence of the dollar/yuan exchange rate.

Title: GigaDevice Semiconductor's Expansion Plans Boost Investor Confidence In a move to strengthen its position in the rapidly growing semiconductor market, GigaDevice Semiconductor Inc has recently expanded its Arm MCU product roadmap through Arm Total Access. This strategic decision has not only piqued investors' interest but also boosted their confidence in the company's future prospects. As of yesterday's closing price, GigaDevice Semiconductor (GDS) stock has been trading at 65.51 Chinese Yuan (CNH), up from its 52 weeks low of 55.2 CNH recorded on February 4th, 2024. This significant increase in share value can be attributed to the company's consistent efforts towards expanding its product offerings and strengthening its presence in the industry. From a technical standpoint, GDS's current price of 65.51 CNH represents a substantial gain of 12.7% from its 52 weeks low. This uptrend is further reinforced by the relative strength index (RSI) which stands at 61.8%, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.

The\nyuan immediately dipped against the dollar, along with\ncurrencies across Asia which are highly sensitive to Chinese\ndemand. [FRX/]\n    While a weaker yuan had been widely expected, with pressure\non the exchange rate since the election of Donald Trump as U.S.\npresident, framing it as a policy shift may herald the start of\na new round of global tariffs, trade tensions and currency\nintervention.\n    \"Currency adjustments are on the table as a tool to be used\nto mitigate the effects of tariffs. I think that is clear,\" said\nFred Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC in Hong Kong.\n    \"Taking the currency weaker might be a signal by China to\nthe rest of the world that there are exchange rate implications\nof imposing tariffs.\" \n    A cheaper exchange rate helps exporters by making their\nprices more competitive internationally.\n        The yuan <CNY=CFXS> dipped about 0.3% and as far as\n7.2803 to the dollar after the Reuters report. The Australian\ndollar <AUD=D3>, which is sensitive to moves in the yuan given\nits hefty commodity exports, touched a one-year low.\n    Trump has said he plans to impose a 10% universal tariff on\nimports to the U.S. and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.\n    Financial markets have been bracing for more volatility from\nhis inauguration on Jan. 20, but have been unsure how seriously\nto take his threats.   \n    Reuters spoke to three people who have knowledge of the\ndiscussions about letting the yuan weaken, one of whom said the\ncentral bank had considered a fall to about 7.5 to the dollar -\nroughly a 3.5% depreciation from current levels around 7.25.\n    Still, that is at the weaker end of investment bank\nexpectations, adding to a sense among investors that China is\ndetermined to be better prepared for trade shocks this time\naround.\n    \"If they need to revitalise the economy, and they tend to be\nmore interested on focusing on exports, there is quite a\ncompelling logic that they may allow the renminbi to soften,\"\nsaid Jane Foley, head of currency strategy at Rabobank.\n    \n    INTENSE, FAST\n    A complicating factor for China is where any slide would\nleave the yuan relative to non-dollar currencies, especially in\nAsia where many neighbours such as Vietnam have grown as hubs\nfor finishing Chinese manufactured goods and avoiding U.S.\nsanctions.\n    Rong Ren Goh, a portfolio manager in the fixed income team\nat Eastspring Investments, said he expects China will\norchestrate a controlled and gradual depreciation but \"Asian\ncurrencies, particularly those of export-driven economies, are\nlikely to adjust in tandem with the yuan on a trade-weighted\nbasis.\"\n    China's exporters have been hoarding dollars with an eye on\na rate of 7.5 as a point to start selling, but they have also\nbeen seeking ways to avoid taking currency risks altogether by\ninvoicing in yuan and other such workarounds - especially as the\nyuan has gained this year on peers <.CFSCNYI>.\n    \"If China takes the currency aggressively lower, it raises\nthe risk of a tariff cascade,\" said HSBC's Neumann, if it\nprompts other economies to put up their own levies to protect\ntheir industrial base from extremely cheap Chinese imports.\n    \"It could lead to a backlash among other trading partners,\nand that's not in the interest of China.\"\n    To be sure, much of the risk lies in the speed or shock\nvalue of any U.S. move, and some market participants don't\nexpect Trump will be in a rush to take direct action. \n    \"There’s some voices in markets calling for a quick 10-20%\ndepreciation (in the yuan) to help offset tariffs,\" said ING's\nGreater China economist Lynn Song.\n    \"We don’t expect an intentional and sharp depreciation like\nthis as it will be ineffective to counteract tariffs, given this\ncould easily be categorized by the U.S. as currency manipulation\nand result in further tariff hikes.\"       \n    Still, at recent analysts' briefings in Singapore, Trump's\ntrade policy was seen as a true wildcard and a weaker Chinese\ncurrency was the consensus for analysts at Nomura and MUFG.\n    \"My view is that there will be FX flexibility that comes\nthrough,\" said Craig Chan, head of global currency strategy at\nNomura, before Reuters' report on China's forex discussions.\n    He recommended a few long dollar positions in Asia.\n    \"Long dollar/CNH is one. We have a target of 7.60 by the end\nof May. It could be intense, could be fast,\" he said. \"That\nwould clearly be the risk to dollar/China - moving higher,\nfaster.\"\n    And at MUFG, a forecast for a drop to 7.5 per dollar was\npredicated on the assumption of an average 40% tariff on Chinese\ngoods.\n    \"A 60% tariff on China products would require a 10%-12% yuan\ndepreciation against the dollar (since September) to 7.8 or\nbeyond ... everything else being equal,\" MUFG analysts said.\n        During Trump's first term as president, the yuan\nweakened more than 12% against the dollar during a series of\ntit-for-tat tariff announcements between March 2018 and May\n2020. \n  \n\n (Additional reporting by Summer Zhen in Hong Kong and Vidya\nRanganathan in Singapore; Writing by Tom Westbrook; Editing by\nKim Coghill)\n ((tom.westbrook@tr.com; +65 6973 8284;))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

Trump has vowed to make the\nUnited States \"the crypto capital of the planet\". \n    \"It's still an extension of the post-election moves; the\neconomic calendar has been relatively light although it's\npicking up later in the week but for now the market is focusing\non the implications of a second Trump term, particularly\npolicies that would be positive for the dollar such as potential\nhigher tariffs,\" said Vassili Serebriakov, an FX strategist at\nUBS in New York.\n        Higher tariffs are expected to push up prices, leaving\nthe Federal Reserve less scope to cut interest rates.\n  \n    The U.S. dollar index <=USD>, which measures the currency\nagainst six peers rose 0.53% to 105.98, hitting its highest\nlevel since early July.\n    Trump's Republican Party will hold a slim majority in both\nhouses of Congress, allowing the president-elect to push his\nagenda cutting taxes and regulation after he takes office in\nJanuary.\n    \"There's been a broad move in the dollar that started before\nthe election and it probably got an added boost because it looks\nlike we're moving to a red sweep scenario, which is broadly seen\nas positive for the dollar,\" Serebriakov added.\n    Trump has warned that the euro bloc will \"pay a big price\"\nfor not buying enough American exports, with cars a particular\ntarget. He has threatened China with blanket 60% tariffs.\n    Since his election last week, the euro has languished at a\nseven-month trough and the yuan slumped to its lowest in more\nthan three months, with Europe and China both targets of\npotential Trump tariffs.\n    The euro is feeling additional pressure from political\nuncertainty in Germany, the bloc's biggest economy. Germany is\nset to hold fresh elections on Feb. 23, which will be eleven\nweeks after the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's governing\ncoalition.\n    The euro <EUR=EBS> sank to $1.06065 on Tuesday, the lowest\nsince mid-April, and was last down 0.41% at $1.061.\n        \n    Sterling <GBP=D3> dropped 0.61% to $1.2791 after data showed\nregular UK wage growth slowed and unemployment rose, with the\npound also feeling the heat from the dollar's rally.\n    Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose 0.46% to 154.41\nyen <JPY=EBS>.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Sept 25 (Reuters) - While financial market have responded positively to\nChina's much-delayed stimulus package, economists remain sceptical, pointing out\nthat even more support will be needed. Yet Beijing is probably not done.\n    Chinese stocks and the yuan continued to surge Wednesday, after Tuesday's\nunveiling of a wide swathe of economic stimulus measures. The offshore yuan\nextended its rally past the 7.0000 watermark to reach a new 16-month high of\n6.9952. The Shanghai composite stock index surged 2.4% while Hong Kong's Hang\nSeng sprinted 2.3% higher.\n    The People's Bank of China delivered on its promise to cut rates, starting\nwith a 30 basis-point easing of the one-year medium-term lending facility rate\nto 2.00%, as signalled on Tuesday. The seven-day reverse repo rate, earmarked to\nbe trimmed by 20 bps to 1.50%, is likely next.\n    Still on the cards is a planned 50 bps slashing of banks' reserve\nrequirement ratio, as well as a cut in the benchmark one-year and five-year loan\nprime rates; the latter affects household mortgages. \n    And there could be more in store beyond the telegraphed monetary policy\neasing moves. Tuesday's coordinated announcement of the economic boosters\nsuggests policymakers' sense of urgency has risen another notch or three.\n     While Beijing has acted judiciously to lower lending costs, support\nproperty markets, reduce mortgage burdens, and to juice the equity markets,\nthere are a couple of major issues to address before naysayers will relent. \n    First, consumer confidence, which might pick up if property prices finally\nturn a corner, possibly via a knock-on effect from a sustained rally in\nequities. Second, joblessness, particularly among the youth, needs to be\nremedied.

One Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion stock can currently be bought for about CNY 16.13 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion stocks is 369 mn. Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion has a current market capitalization of CNY 5.9 bn and approximately CNY 110.3 mn worth of Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion has traded -0.5 % down. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNY 18.45. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNY 22.93 on 05/09/2024. 52 weeks low was at CNY 12.87 on 02/06/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion\n\nTitle: Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology: Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors may be eyeing Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd (ZJLMT) for its potential growth opportunities, given its strong fundamentals and technical indicators. As of September 23rd, 2024, the stock has been trading steadily with its last closing price at 15.5 CNH. Looking back at the company's historical performance, ZJLMT has shown significant upside potential over the past year. Its 52-week high of 22.93 CNH was reached on May 8th, 2024, while its 52-week low of 12.87 CNH was seen on February 5th, 2024. This range represents a substantial increase of 96.4% from its lowest point to its highest point during this period. Currently, ZJLMT is trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) of 14.33 CNH and its 200-day MA of 16.47 CNH, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 58.67, suggesting that it is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further growth. From a valuation perspective, ZJLMT's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 19.17, which is slightly higher than the industry average. However, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.41 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. These ratios suggest that investors may be missing out on an opportunity to buy into a fundamentally sound company at a discounted price. Technically speaking, ZJLMT appears to be consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, which could indicate a breakout towards the upside. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle around 18.5 CNH, it could potentially reach its next resistance level at 20.5 CNH. On the flip side, a break below the lower boundary of the triangle around 14.5 CNH could lead to a pullback towards the support level at 13 CNH. In conclusion, Zhejiang Jiecang Linear Motion Technology Co Ltd seems poised for continued growth based on its technical and fundamental analysis. Investors looking for a solid long-term investment may consider adding ZJLMT to their portfolios, but should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Embedway Shanghai (603496.SS) traded down -0.05 % and now trades at CNY 22.23.

Rallies on\nthe Shanghai Composite Index have lifted the currency, though mostly via a psychological effect,\nsince overseas equity investors remain leery of stocks. This correlation may, however, be\none-directional. USD/CNH downside could depend on whether the Shanghai stock rally sustains.\nConversely, upside appears limited, even if the SSEC sputters. USD/CNH has trended lower the\npast week, coinciding with the SSEC rebounding as much as 14.2% from the Feb 5 low. The index\nbroke above the 3,000 points psychological barrier early Friday but is now flailing around that\nwatermark. A daily closing above 2,979 would clear its Ichimoku cloud resistance zone, paving a\nway higher. That could restart the USD/CNH descent, which has stalled after bouncing off its own\ncloud barrier at 7.1990. A Friday close below 7.1954, the entrance of the daily Bollinger\ndowntrend channel, would put it back on track. While officials accelerate efforts to support\nstocks after a leadership change at the securities regulator, Chinese FX authorities continue to\nput up a resolute defence of the currency via direct market intervention as well as through the\nstubbornly stable USD/CNY fixing. This implies the yuan will only be allowed to react positively\nto Chinese stock movements.\n \n To read our latest FX news and analysis services, click on [FXBUZ]\n\n ((ifr.fx@thomsonreuters.com))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic is trading -0.02 percent lower with a volume of CNH 301 mn on Friday 20th of SeptemberSep 20, 2024\n\nJiangsu Hengli Hydraulic (601100.SS) traded down -0.02 % during a 24 hours period ending at 11:01 AM Central Europe on Friday 20th. One Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic stock can currently be bought for about CNH 52.31 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic stocks is 1.3 bn. Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic has a current market capitalization of CNH 69.8 bn and approximately CNH 301 mn worth of Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic has traded 19.4 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at CNH 51.09. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at CNH 66.23 on 09/27/2023. 52 weeks low was at CNH 41.55 on 07/17/2024.\n\nSummary of the latest news for Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic\n\nJiangsu Hengli Hydraulic Co Ltd: Technical Analysis As of September 16th, 2024, there have been no recent news updates for Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic Co Ltd. However, based on historical data, we can analyze the company's performance and outlook. Last Closing Price: 52.1 CNH The last closing price of Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic was 52.1 CNH on December 12th, 2023. This marks a decrease of 3.9% compared to November's performance, according to an article published by C WorldWide Emerging Markets on December 12th, 2023. 52 Weeks High/Low: 66.23 CNH / 41.55 CNH Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic reached its 52 weeks high of 66.23 CNH on September 26th, 2023, and its 52 weeks low of 41.55 CNH on July 16th, 2024. This indicates a significant fluctuation in the company's stock value over the past year. Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E): 27.82 Based on the company's latest financial report, the price to earnings ratio (P/E) stands at 27.82, indicating that investors are willing to pay approximately 27.82 times the company's earnings per share. Price to Book Ratio (P/B): 4.76 The price to book ratio (P/B) of Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic is currently 4.76, which suggests that the market values the company's assets at approximately 4.76 times their book value. From a technical standpoint, Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic's stock has experienced a downward trend since reaching its 52 weeks high in September 2023. The current price of 52.1 CNH represents a support level, and a break below this point could lead to further declines. On the other hand, a bounce back above the 52 weeks high could signal a potential reversal in the company's fortunes. In conclusion, while there have been no recent news updates for Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic Co Ltd, a technical analysis of the company's historical stock performance reveals a mixed picture. While the company's P/E and P/B ratios suggest undervaluation, the recent downward trend may indicate caution for potential investors. Further developments and future announcements will be crucial in determining the company's long-term prospects.\n\nHere is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:\n\n- Air China (601111.SS) traded down -0.47 % and now trades at HKD 6.29. Current market capitalisation for Air China is HKD 92 bn. Title: Air China's Share Price Plummets Despite Lack of Recent News In a surprising turn of events, Air China's share price has been steadily declining over the past few months, despite the lack of any significant recent news or developments related to the company. As of yesterday's closing bell, the stock closed at 6.55 CNY, marking a substantial decrease from its 52-week high of 8.54 CNY reached on September 17th, 2023. Technical Analysis: A Closer Look From a technical standpoint, Air China's share price appears to be trending downwards, with a series of lower highs and lower lows forming a clear descending pattern. This suggests that the stock may be experiencing selling pressure, which could be attributed to various factors such as investor sentiment, market conditions, or potential changes in the company's fundamentals. Looking back at the stock's historical performance, we can see that Air China experienced a significant surge in share price during the second half of 2023, peaking at 8.54 CNY on September 17th. However, since then, the stock has been gradually losing momentum, falling below both its short-term and long-term moving averages. Currently, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at around 38, indicating that it is oversold but still showing signs of downward momentum. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is also pointing towards a bearish outlook, with the MACD line crossing below the signal line in recent days. Outlook and Potential Catalysts Despite the recent downturn, some analysts remain optimistic about Air China's prospects, citing the company's strong financials and solid track record of growth. Moreover, the upcoming Chinese National Day holiday period, which falls on October 1st this year, is typically a busy travel season, which could potentially boost demand for air travel and benefit Air China's bottom line. However, it is worth noting that the global economy remains uncertain, with ongoing geopolitical tensions and inflation concerns continuing to impact financial markets worldwide. Therefore, any negative surprises or unexpected developments could potentially exacerbate the downward pressure on Air China's share price. In conclusion, while there have been no recent major announcements from Air China, the company's share price continues to experience downward pressure, suggesting that investors may be cautious about the company's future prospects. Nevertheless, with a solid balance sheet and a proven track record of success, Air China remains an attractive option for risk-tolerant investors looking to capitalize on the long-term growth potential of the aviation industry.\n\n- China Southern Airlines (600029.SS) traded down -0.19 % and now trades at HKD 2.42. China Southern Airlines has a market capitalisation of HKD 85.4 bn. Title: China Southern Airlines' Efforts to Reduce Losses Paying Off? Investors may be keeping a close eye on China Southern Airlines Co Ltd (HKG:1055), as the airline continues to navigate through challenging times. Despite the lack of recent news, a look back at previous reports reveals some interesting trends that could impact the stock's performance. According to data from Airliners.de, the last reported news on China Southern Airlines dates back to August 30th, with the headline \"China Southern Airlines reduces losses.\" This suggests that the company has been taking steps to mitigate its financial struggles, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking at the stock's historical pricing, we can see that the last closing price was 5.27 HKD, representing a significant drop from its 52-week high of 6.38 HKD on November 26th, 2023. However, the stock has remained relatively stable over the past month, with minimal fluctuations. One key metric that investors may want to focus on is the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) of -18.39, indicating that the stock is trading at a discount compared to its peers. Additionally, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) of 1.16 suggests that the stock is undervalued based on its assets. While there is no guarantee that China Southern Airlines will continue to reduce its losses or maintain its current valuation, these metrics suggest that the company may be poised for growth in the long term. However, investors should always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions.\n\n- Goneo (603195.SS) traded up 1.72 % and now trades at CNH 64.98. Goneo has a market capitalisation of CNH 81.1 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Goneo is 18.81. Title: Goneo's Strong Fundamentals and Technical Indicators Point to Continued Growth Investors looking for a strong and stable investment opportunity may want to consider Goneo Group Co Ltd (GONEO), a leading provider of innovative solutions for various industries. Despite the lack of recent news, the company's fundamentals and technical indicators paint a picture of continued growth and potential gains. Strong Financials According to the latest available data, Goneo's last closing price was 64.56 CNH, representing a 52-week high of 120.89 CNH at 2024-04-29 22:00:00 and a 52-week low of 61.01 CNH at 2024-09-10 22:00:00. The price to earnings ratio stands at 18.81, while the price to book ratio is 5.9. These figures indicate a healthy and profitable business with a strong balance sheet. Technical Analysis From a technical perspective, Goneo's stock has been trending upwards over the past year, with a few minor setbacks. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 57.67, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral position. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line is above the signal line, indicating a bullish signal. Additionally, the stock's Bollinger Bands are contracting, which can be an indication of increased volatility and potentially higher prices in the near future. Outlook Based on these technical and fundamental indicators, it appears that Goneo is well-positioned for continued growth and success. While there may be some short-term fluctuations, the long-term outlook remains positive. Investors considering adding Goneo to their portfolios should do so with confidence, knowing that the company's strong financials and solid track record make it a reliable choice for those seeking steady returns.\n\n- China Railway Construction (601186.SS) traded up 1.76 % and now trades at HKD 4.42. Current market capitalisation for China Railway Construction is HKD 88.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for China Railway Construction is 2.42. China Railway Construction Soars Ahead with Groundbreaking Progress Shanghai, China - Investors are keeping a close eye on China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) as the company continues to make strides in modernizing the country's rail network. Despite a lack of recent news, CRCC's strong fundamentals and impressive track record have analysts optimistic about the company's future prospects. As of yesterday's market close, CRCC's stock closed at 6.83 CNY, up from its 52-week low of 6.83 CNY on September 12th. This marks a significant recovery for the company, which saw its share price plummet to a 52-week low earlier this year. Looking back at CRCC's performance over the past year, the company has made remarkable progress in driving forward the modernization of China's railways. According to an EQS-News report from April 24th, CRCC has been making \"bahnbrechende fortschritte\" or groundbreaking advancements towards achieving this goal. From a technical perspective, CRCC's stock appears to be trending upwards, with its 52-week high reaching 9.29 CNY on January 28th. However, the company's price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) of 4.36674 and price to book ratio (P/B Ratio) of 0.292956 suggest that the stock may still be undervalued compared to its peers. In light of these developments, investors may want to keep a close eye on CRCC as the company continues to drive growth and innovation in China's railway sector. With a solid balance sheet and a proven track record of success, CRCC could be poised for long-term success in the years ahead.\n\n- Shanghai Airport (600009.SS) traded up 2.15 % and now trades at CNH 31.22. Current market capitalisation for Shanghai Airport is CNH 77.1 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Shanghai Airport is 47.68.\n\n-----------\n\nAbout Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic\n\nJiangsu Hengli Hydraulic Co Ltd is a Chinese company based in Changzhou that specializes in the development, manufacturing, and selling of high pressure tanks, hydraulic components, and hydraulic systems.
